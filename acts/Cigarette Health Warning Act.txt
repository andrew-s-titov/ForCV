    Sec. 2. Legislative Findings. The General Assembly finds that there is a need for public information about the risk of harm to unborn children when women smoke cigarettes during pregnancy. The United States Surgeon General has recommended abstinence from cigarette smoking during pregnancy. Since the adverse effects of cigarette smoking during pregnancy are preventable, the General Assembly finds that it is in the public interest to provide warnings at places where cigarettes are sold about the risks of cigarette smoking during pregnancy.
