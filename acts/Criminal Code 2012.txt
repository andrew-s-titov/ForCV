    (720 ILCS 5/1-5) (from Ch. 38, par. 1-5)
    Sec. 1-5. State criminal jurisdiction.
    (a) A person is subject to prosecution in this State for an offense which he commits, while either within or outside the State, by his own conduct or that of another for which he is legally accountable, if:
        (1) the offense is committed either wholly or partly
    	
within the State; or
        (2) the conduct outside the State constitutes an
    	
attempt to commit an offense within the State; or
        (3) the conduct outside the State constitutes a
    	
conspiracy to commit an offense within the State, and an act in furtherance of the conspiracy occurs in the State; or
        (4) the conduct within the State constitutes an
    	
attempt, solicitation or conspiracy to commit in another jurisdiction an offense under the laws of both this State and such other jurisdiction.
    (b) An offense is committed partly within this State, if either the conduct which is an element of the offense, or the result which is such an element, occurs within the State. In a prosecution pursuant to paragraph (3) of subsection (a) of Section 9-1, the attempt or commission of a forcible felony other than second degree murder within this State is conduct which is an element of the offense for which a person is subject to prosecution in this State. In homicide, the "result" is either the physical contact which causes death, or the death itself; and if the body of a homicide victim is found within the State, the death is presumed to have occurred within the State.
    (c) An offense which is based on an omission to perform a duty imposed by the law of this State is committed within the State, regardless of the location of the offender at the time of the omission.

    Sec. 3-4. Effect of former prosecution.
    (a) A prosecution is barred if the defendant was formerly prosecuted for the same offense, based upon the same facts, if that former prosecution:
        (1) resulted in either a conviction or an acquittal
    	
or in a determination that the evidence was insufficient to warrant a conviction;
        (2) was terminated by a final order or judgment, even
    	
if entered before trial, that required a determination inconsistent with any fact or legal proposition necessary to a conviction in the subsequent prosecution; or
        (3) was terminated improperly after the jury was
    	
impaneled and sworn or, in a trial before a court without a jury, after the first witness was sworn but before findings were rendered by the trier of facts, or after a plea of guilty was accepted by the court.
    A conviction of an included offense, other than through a plea of guilty, is an acquittal of the offense charged.
    (b) A prosecution is barred if the defendant was formerly prosecuted for a different offense, or for the same offense based upon different facts, if that former prosecution:
        (1) resulted in either a conviction or an acquittal,
    	
and the subsequent prosecution is for an offense of which the defendant could have been convicted on the former prosecution; or was for an offense with which the defendant should have been charged on the former prosecution, as provided in Section 3-3 of this Code (unless the court ordered a separate trial of that charge); or was for an offense that involves the same conduct, unless each prosecution requires proof of a fact not required on the other prosecution, or the offense was not consummated when the former trial began;
        (2) was terminated by a final order or judgment, even
    	
if entered before trial, that required a determination inconsistent with any fact necessary to a conviction in the subsequent prosecution; or
        (3) was terminated improperly under the circumstances
    	
stated in subsection (a), and the subsequent prosecution is for an offense of which the defendant could have been convicted if the former prosecution had not been terminated improperly.
    (c) A prosecution is barred if the defendant was formerly prosecuted in a District Court of the United States or in a sister state for an offense that is within the concurrent jurisdiction of this State, if that former prosecution:
        (1) resulted in either a conviction or an acquittal,
    	
and the subsequent prosecution is for the same conduct, unless each prosecution requires proof of a fact not required in the other prosecution, or the offense was not consummated when the former trial began; or
        (2) was terminated by a final order or judgment, even
    	
if entered before trial, that required a determination inconsistent with any fact necessary to a conviction in the prosecution in this State.
    (d) A prosecution is not barred within the meaning of this Section 3-4, however, if the former prosecution:
        (1) was before a court that lacked jurisdiction over
    	
the defendant or the offense; or
        (2) was procured by the defendant without the
    	
knowledge of the proper prosecuting officer, and with the purpose of avoiding the sentence that otherwise might be imposed; or if subsequent proceedings resulted in the invalidation, setting aside, reversal, or vacating of the conviction, unless the defendant was thereby adjudged not guilty.

        (1) the defendant is not usually and publicly
    	
resident within this State; or
        (2) the defendant is a public officer and the
    	
offense charged is theft of public funds while in public office; or
        (3) a prosecution is pending against the defendant
    	
for the same conduct, even if the indictment or information which commences the prosecution is quashed or the proceedings thereon are set aside, or are reversed on appeal; or
        (4) a proceeding or an appeal from a proceeding
    	
relating to the quashing or enforcement of a Grand Jury subpoena issued in connection with an investigation of a violation of a criminal law of this State is pending. However, the period within which a prosecution must be commenced includes any period in which the State brings a proceeding or an appeal from a proceeding specified in this paragraph (4); or
        (5) a material witness is placed on active military

        (6) the victim of unlawful force or threat of
    	
imminent bodily harm to obtain information or a confession is incarcerated, and the victim's incarceration, in whole or in part, is a consequence of the unlawful force or threats; or
        (7) the sexual assault evidence is collected and

ARTICLE 4. CRIMINAL ACT AND MENTAL STATE

    (720 ILCS 5/4-1) (from Ch. 38, par. 4-1)
    Sec. 4-1. Voluntary act.
    A material element of every offense is a voluntary act, which includes an omission to perform a duty which the law imposes on the offender and which he is physically capable of performing.
(Source: Laws 1961, p. 1983.)

    (720 ILCS 5/4-2) (from Ch. 38, par. 4-2)
    Sec. 4-2. Possession as voluntary act.
    Possession is a voluntary act if the offender knowingly procured or received the thing possessed, or was aware of his control thereof for a sufficient time to have been able to terminate his possession.
(Source: Laws 1961, p. 1983.)

    (720 ILCS 5/4-3) (from Ch. 38, par. 4-3)
    Sec. 4-3. Mental state.
    (a) A person is not guilty of an offense, other than an offense which involves absolute liability, unless, with respect to each element described by the statute defining the offense, he acts while having one of the mental states described in Sections 4-4 through 4-7.
    (b) If the statute defining an offense prescribed a particular mental state with respect to the offense as a whole, without distinguishing among the elements thereof, the prescribed mental state applies to each such element. If the statute does not prescribe a particular mental state applicable to an element of an offense (other than an offense which involves absolute liability), any mental state defined in Sections 4-4, 4-5 or 4-6 is applicable.
    (c) Knowledge that certain conduct constitutes an offense, or knowledge of the existence, meaning, or application of the statute defining an offense, is not an element of the offense unless the statute clearly defines it as such.
(Source: Laws 1961, p. 1983.)

    (720 ILCS 5/4-4) (from Ch. 38, par. 4-4)
    Sec. 4-4. Intent.
    A person intends, or acts intentionally or with intent, to accomplish a result or engage in conduct described by the statute defining the offense, when his conscious objective or purpose is to accomplish that result or engage in that conduct.
(Source: Laws 1961, p. 1983.)

    (720 ILCS 5/4-5) (from Ch. 38, par. 4-5)
    Sec. 4-5. Knowledge. A person knows, or acts knowingly or with knowledge of:
        (a) The nature or attendant circumstances of his or
    	
her conduct, described by the statute defining the offense, when he or she is consciously aware that his or her conduct is of that nature or that those circumstances exist. Knowledge of a material fact includes awareness of the substantial probability that the fact exists.
        (b) The result of his or her conduct, described by
    	
the statute defining the offense, when he or she is consciously aware that that result is practically certain to be caused by his conduct.
    Conduct performed knowingly or with knowledge is performed wilfully, within the meaning of a statute using the term "willfully", unless the statute clearly requires another meaning.
    When the law provides that acting knowingly suffices to establish an element of an offense, that element also is established if a person acts intentionally.
(Source: P.A. 96-710, eff. 1-1-10.)

    (720 ILCS 5/4-6) (from Ch. 38, par. 4-6)
    Sec. 4-6. Recklessness. A person is reckless or acts recklessly when that person consciously disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that circumstances exist or that a result will follow, described by the statute defining the offense, and that disregard constitutes a gross deviation from the standard of care that a reasonable person would exercise in the situation. An act performed recklessly is performed wantonly, within the meaning of a statute using the term "wantonly", unless the statute clearly requires another meaning.
(Source: P.A. 96-710, eff. 1-1-10.)

    (720 ILCS 5/4-7) (from Ch. 38, par. 4-7)
    Sec. 4-7. Negligence. A person is negligent, or acts negligently, when that person fails to be aware of a substantial and unjustifiable risk that circumstances exist or a result will follow, described by the statute defining the offense, and that failure constitutes a substantial deviation from the standard of care that a reasonable person would exercise in the situation.
(Source: P.A. 96-710, eff. 1-1-10.)

    (720 ILCS 5/4-8) (from Ch. 38, par. 4-8)
    Sec. 4-8. Ignorance or mistake.
    (a) A person's ignorance or mistake as to a matter of either fact or law, except as provided in Section 4-3(c) above, is a defense if it negatives the existence of the mental state which the statute prescribes with respect to an element of the offense.
    (b) A person's reasonable belief that his conduct does not constitute an offense is a defense if:
        (1) the offense is defined by an administrative
    	
regulation or order which is not known to him and has not been published or otherwise made reasonably available to him, and he could not have acquired such knowledge by the exercise of due diligence pursuant to facts known to him; or
        (2) he acts in reliance upon a statute which later is
    	
determined to be invalid; or
        (3) he acts in reliance upon an order or opinion of
    	
an Illinois Appellate or Supreme Court, or a United States appellate court later overruled or reversed; or
        (4) he acts in reliance upon an official
    	
interpretation of the statute, regulation or order defining the offense, made by a public officer or agency legally authorized to interpret such statute.
    (c) Although a person's ignorance or mistake of fact or law, or reasonable belief, described in this Section 4-8 is a defense to the offense charged, he may be convicted of an included offense of which he would be guilty if the fact or law were as he believed it to be.
    (d) A defense based upon this Section 4-8 is an affirmative defense.

    (720 ILCS 5/4-9) (from Ch. 38, par. 4-9)
    Sec. 4-9. Absolute liability. A person may be guilty of an offense without having, as to each element thereof, one of the mental states described in Sections 4-4 through 4-7 if the offense is a misdemeanor which is not punishable by incarceration or by a fine exceeding $1,000, or the statute defining the offense clearly indicates a legislative purpose to impose absolute liability for the conduct described.

    (720 ILCS 5/Art. 5 heading)
ARTICLE 5. PARTIES TO CRIME

    (720 ILCS 5/5-1) (from Ch. 38, par. 5-1)
    Sec. 5-1. Accountability for conduct of another. A person is responsible for conduct which is an element of an offense if the conduct is either that of the person himself, or that of another and he is legally accountable for such conduct as provided in Section 5-2, or both.
(Source: Laws 1961, p. 1983.)

    (720 ILCS 5/5-2) (from Ch. 38, par. 5-2)
    Sec. 5-2. When accountability exists. A person is legally accountable for the conduct of another when:
        (a) having a mental state described by the statute
    	
defining the offense, he or she causes another to perform the conduct, and the other person in fact or by reason of legal incapacity lacks such a mental state;
        (b) the statute defining the offense makes him or her
    	
so accountable; or
        (c) either before or during the commission of an
    	
offense, and with the intent to promote or facilitate that commission, he or she solicits, aids, abets, agrees, or attempts to aid that other person in the planning or commission of the offense.
    When 2 or more persons engage in a common criminal design or agreement, any acts in the furtherance of that common design committed by one party are considered to be the acts of all parties to the common design or agreement and all are equally responsible for the consequences of those further acts. Mere presence at the scene of a crime does not render a person accountable for an offense; a person's presence at the scene of a crime, however, may be considered with other circumstances by the trier of fact when determining accountability.
    A person is not so accountable, however, unless the statute defining the offense provides otherwise, if:
        (1) he or she is a victim of the offense committed;
        (2) the offense is so defined that his or her conduct
    	
was inevitably incident to its commission; or
        (3) before the commission of the offense, he or she
    	
terminates his or her effort to promote or facilitate that commission and does one of the following: (i) wholly deprives his or her prior efforts of effectiveness in that commission, (ii) gives timely warning to the proper law enforcement authorities, or (iii) otherwise makes proper effort to prevent the commission of the offense.
(Source: P.A. 96-710, eff. 1-1-10.)

    (720 ILCS 5/5-3) (from Ch. 38, par. 5-3)
    Sec. 5-3. Separate conviction of person accountable.
    A person who is legally accountable for the conduct of another which is an element of an offense may be convicted upon proof that the offense was committed and that he was so accountable, although the other person claimed to have committed the offense has not been prosecuted or convicted, or has been convicted of a different offense or degree of offense, or is not amenable to justice, or has been acquitted.
(Source: Laws 1961, p. 1983.)

    (720 ILCS 5/5-4) (from Ch. 38, par. 5-4)
    Sec. 5-4. Responsibility of corporation. (a) A corporation may be prosecuted for the commission of an offense if, but only if:
    (1) The offense is a misdemeanor, or is defined by Sections 11-20, 11-20.1 or 24-1 of this Code, or Section 44 of the "Environmental Protection Act", approved June 29, 1970, as amended or is defined by another statute which clearly indicates a legislative purpose to impose liability on a corporation; and an agent of the corporation performs the conduct which is an element of the offense while acting within the scope of his or her office or employment and in behalf of the corporation, except that any limitation in the defining statute, concerning the corporation's accountability for certain agents or under certain circumstances, is applicable; or
    (2) The commission of the offense is authorized, requested, commanded, or performed, by the board of directors or by a high managerial agent who is acting within the scope of his or her employment in behalf of the corporation.
    (b) A corporation's proof, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the high managerial agent having supervisory responsibility over the conduct which is the subject matter of the offense exercised due diligence to prevent the commission of the offense, is a defense to a prosecution for any offense to which Subsection (a) (1) refers, other than an offense for which absolute liability is imposed. This Subsection is inapplicable if the legislative purpose of the statute defining the offense is inconsistent with the provisions of this Subsection.
    (c) For the purpose of this Section:
    (1) "Agent" means any director, officer, servant, employee, or other person who is authorized to act in behalf of the corporation.
    (2) "High managerial agent" means an officer of the corporation, or any other agent who has a position of comparable authority for the formulation of corporate policy or the supervision of subordinate employees in a managerial capacity.
(Source: P.A. 85-1440.)

    (720 ILCS 5/5-5) (from Ch. 38, par. 5-5)
    Sec. 5-5. Accountability for conduct of corporation.
    (a) A person is legally accountable for conduct which is an element of an offense and which, in the name or in behalf of a corporation, he performs or causes to be performed, to the same extent as if the conduct were performed in his own name or behalf.
    (b) An individual who has been convicted of an offense by reason of his legal accountability for the conduct of a corporation is subject to the punishment authorized by law for an individual upon conviction of such offense, although only a lesser or different punishment is authorized for the corporation.

ARTICLE 6. RESPONSIBILITY

    (720 ILCS 5/6-1) (from Ch. 38, par. 6-1)
    Sec. 6-1. Infancy.
    No person shall be convicted of any offense unless he had attained his 13th birthday at the time the offense was committed.
(Source: Laws 1961, p. 1983.)

    (720 ILCS 5/6-2) (from Ch. 38, par. 6-2)
    Sec. 6-2. Insanity.
    (a) A person is not criminally responsible for conduct if at the time of such conduct, as a result of mental disease or mental defect, he lacks substantial capacity to appreciate the criminality of his conduct.
    (b) The terms "mental disease or mental defect" do not include an abnormality manifested only by repeated criminal or otherwise antisocial conduct.
    (c) A person who, at the time of the commission of a criminal offense, was not insane but was suffering from a mental illness, is not relieved of criminal responsibility for his conduct and may be found guilty but mentally ill.
    (d) For purposes of this Section, "mental illness" or "mentally ill" means a substantial disorder of thought, mood, or behavior which afflicted a person at the time of the commission of the offense and which impaired that person's judgment, but not to the extent that he is unable to appreciate the wrongfulness of his behavior.
    (e) When the defense of insanity has been presented during the trial, the burden of proof is on the defendant to prove by clear and convincing evidence that the defendant is not guilty by reason of insanity. However, the burden of proof remains on the State to prove beyond a reasonable doubt each of the elements of each of the offenses charged, and, in a jury trial where the insanity defense has been presented, the jury must be instructed that it may not consider whether the defendant has met his burden of proving that he is not guilty by reason of insanity until and unless it has first determined that the State has proven the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt of the offense with which he is charged.

    Sec. 6-3. Intoxicated or drugged condition.

    (720 ILCS 5/6-4) (from Ch. 38, par. 6-4)

A defense based upon any of the provisions of Article 6 is an affirmative defense except that mental illness is not an affirmative defense, but an alternative plea or finding that may be accepted, under appropriate evidence, when the affirmative defense of insanity is raised or the plea of guilty but mentally ill is made.

    (720 ILCS 5/7-1) (from Ch. 38, par. 7-1)
    Sec. 7-1. Use of force in defense of person.
    (a) A person is justified in the use of force against another when and to the extent that he reasonably believes that such conduct is necessary to defend himself or another against such other's imminent use of unlawful force. However, he is justified in the use of force which is intended or likely to cause death or great bodily harm only if he reasonably believes that such force is necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm to himself or another, or the commission of a forcible felony.
    (b) In no case shall any act involving the use of force justified under this Section give rise to any claim or liability brought by or on behalf of any person acting within the definition of "aggressor" set forth in Section 7-4 of this Article, or the estate, spouse, or other family member of such a person, against the person or estate of the person using such justified force, unless the use of force involves willful or wanton misconduct.

    (a) A person is justified in the use of force against another when and to the extent that he reasonably believes that such conduct is necessary to prevent or terminate such other's unlawful entry into or attack upon a dwelling. However, he is justified in the use of force which is intended or likely to cause death or great bodily harm only if:
        (1) The entry is made or attempted in a violent,
    	
riotous, or tumultuous manner, and he reasonably believes that such force is necessary to prevent an assault upon, or offer of personal violence to, him or another then in the dwelling, or
        (2) He reasonably believes that such force is
    	
necessary to prevent the commission of a felony in the dwelling.
    (b) In no case shall any act involving the use of force justified under this Section give rise to any claim or liability brought by or on behalf of any person acting within the definition of "aggressor" set forth in Section 7-4 of this Article, or the estate, spouse, or other family member of such a person, against the person or estate of the person using such justified force, unless the use of force involves willful or wanton misconduct.

    (a) A person is justified in the use of force against another when and to the extent that he reasonably believes that such conduct is necessary to prevent or terminate such other's trespass on or other tortious or criminal interference with either real property (other than a dwelling) or personal property, lawfully in his possession or in the possession of another who is a member of his immediate family or household or of a person whose property he has a legal duty to protect. However, he is justified in the use of force which is intended or likely to cause death or great bodily harm only if he reasonably believes that such force is necessary to prevent the commission of a forcible felony.
    (b) In no case shall any act involving the use of force justified under this Section give rise to any claim or liability brought by or on behalf of any person acting within the definition of "aggressor" set forth in Section 7-4 of this Article, or the estate, spouse, or other family member of such a person, against the person or estate of the person using such justified force, unless the use of force involves willful or wanton misconduct.

    Sec. 7-4. Use of force by aggressor. The justification described in the preceding Sections of this Article is not available to a person who:
        (a) is attempting to commit, committing, or escaping
    	
after the commission of, a forcible felony; or
        (b) initially provokes the use of force against
    	
himself, with the intent to use such force as an excuse to inflict bodily harm upon the assailant; or
        (c) otherwise initially provokes the use of force
    	
against himself, unless:
            (1) such force is so great that he reasonably
        	
believes that he is in imminent danger of death or great bodily harm, and that he has exhausted every reasonable means to escape such danger other than the use of force which is likely to cause death or great bodily harm to the assailant; or
            (2) in good faith, he withdraws from physical
        	
contact with the assailant and indicates clearly to the assailant that he desires to withdraw and terminate the use of force, but the assailant continues or resumes the use of force.

    (Text of Section before amendment by P.A. 101-652)
    Sec. 7-5. Peace officer's use of force in making arrest.
    (a) A peace officer, or any person whom he has summoned or directed to assist him, need not retreat or desist from efforts to make a lawful arrest because of resistance or threatened resistance to the arrest. He is justified in the use of any force which he reasonably believes to be necessary to effect the arrest and of any force which he reasonably believes to be necessary to defend himself or another from bodily harm while making the arrest. However, he is justified in using force likely to cause death or great bodily harm only when he reasonably believes that such force is necessary to prevent death or great bodily harm to himself or such other person, or when he reasonably believes both that:
        (1) Such force is necessary to prevent the arrest
    	
from being defeated by resistance or escape; and
        (2) The person to be arrested has committed or
    	
attempted a forcible felony which involves the infliction or threatened infliction of great bodily harm or is attempting to escape by use of a deadly weapon, or otherwise indicates that he will endanger human life or inflict great bodily harm unless arrested without delay.
    (b) A peace officer making an arrest pursuant to an invalid warrant is justified in the use of any force which he would be justified in using if the warrant were valid, unless he knows that the warrant is invalid.

    (Text of Section after amendment by P.A. 101-652)
    Sec. 7-5. Peace officer's use of force in making arrest.
    (a) A peace officer, or any person whom he has summoned or directed to assist him, need not retreat or desist from efforts to make a lawful arrest because of resistance or threatened resistance to the arrest. He is justified in the use of any force which he reasonably believes, based on the totality of the circumstances, to be necessary to effect the arrest and of any force which he reasonably believes, based on the totality of the circumstances, to be necessary to defend himself or another from bodily harm while making the arrest. However, he is justified in using force likely to cause death or great bodily harm only when he reasonably believes, based on the totality of the circumstances, that such force is necessary to prevent death or great bodily harm to himself or such other person, or when he reasonably believes, based on the totality of the circumstances, both that:
        (1) Such force is necessary to prevent the arrest
    	
from being defeated by resistance or escape; the officer reasonably believes that the person to be arrested cannot be apprehended at a later date, and the officer reasonably believes that the person to be arrested is likely to cause great bodily harm to another; and
        (2) The person to be arrested just committed or
    	
attempted a forcible felony which involves the infliction or threatened infliction of great bodily harm or is attempting to escape by use of a deadly weapon, or otherwise indicates that he will endanger human life or inflict great bodily harm unless arrested without delay.
    As used in this subsection, "retreat" does not mean tactical repositioning or other de-escalation tactics.
    (a-5) Where feasible, a peace officer shall, prior to the use of force, make reasonable efforts to identify himself or herself as a peace officer and to warn that deadly force may be used, unless the officer has reasonable grounds to believe that the person is aware of those facts.
    (a-10) A peace officer shall not use deadly force against a person based on the danger that the person poses to himself or herself if an reasonable officer would believe the person does not pose an imminent threat of death or serious bodily injury to the peace officer or to another person.
    (a-15) A peace officer shall not use deadly force against a person who is suspected of committing a property offense, unless that offense is terrorism or unless deadly force is otherwise authorized by law.
    (b) A peace officer making an arrest pursuant to an invalid warrant is justified in the use of any force which he would be justified in using if the warrant were valid, unless he knows that the warrant is invalid.
    (c) The authority to use physical force conferred on peace officers by this Article is a serious responsibility that shall be exercised judiciously and with respect for human rights and dignity and for the sanctity of every human life.
    (d) Peace officers shall use deadly force only when reasonably necessary in defense of human life. In determining whether deadly force is reasonably necessary, officers shall evaluate each situation in light of the particular circumstances of each case and shall use other available resources and techniques, if reasonably safe and feasible to a reasonable officer.
    (e) The decision by a peace officer to use force shall be evaluated carefully and thoroughly, in a manner that reflects the gravity of that authority and the serious consequences of the use of force by peace officers, in order to ensure that officers use force consistent with law and agency policies.
    (f) The decision by a peace officer to use force shall be evaluated from the perspective of a reasonable officer in the same situation, based on the totality of the circumstances known to or perceived by the officer at the time of the decision, rather than with the benefit of hindsight, and that the totality of the circumstances shall account for occasions when officers may be forced to make quick judgments about using force.
    (g) Law enforcement agencies are encouraged to adopt and develop policies designed to protect individuals with physical, mental health, developmental, or intellectual disabilities, who are significantly more likely to experience greater levels of physical force during police interactions, as these disabilities may affect the ability of a person to understand or comply with commands from peace officers.
    (h) As used in this Section:
        (1) "Deadly force" means any use of force that
    	
creates a substantial risk of causing death or serious bodily injury, including, but not limited to, the discharge of a firearm.
        (2) A threat of death or serious bodily injury is
    	
"imminent" when, based on the totality of the circumstances, a reasonable officer in the same situation would believe that a person has the present ability, opportunity, and apparent intent to immediately cause death or serious bodily injury to the peace officer or another person. An imminent harm is not merely a fear of future harm, no matter how great the fear and no matter how great the likelihood of the harm, but is one that, from appearances, must be instantly confronted and addressed.
        (3) "Totality of the circumstances" means all facts
    	
known to the peace officer at the time, or that would be known to a reasonable officer in the same situation, including the conduct of the officer and the subject leading up to the use of deadly force.

        (1) has not been prosecuted or convicted; or
        (2) has been convicted of a different offense; or
        (3) is not amenable to justice; or
        (4) has been acquitted; or
        (5) lacked the capacity to commit an offense.

    (a) Elements of the offense.
    A person commits the offense of attempt when, with intent to commit a specific offense, he or she does any act that constitutes a substantial step toward the commission of that offense.
    (b) Impossibility.
    It is not a defense to a charge of attempt that because of a misapprehension of the circumstances it would have been impossible for the accused to commit the offense attempted.
    (c) Sentence.
    A person convicted of attempt may be fined or imprisoned or both not to exceed the maximum provided for the offense attempted but, except for an attempt to commit the offense defined in Section 33A-2 of this Code:
        (1) the sentence for attempt to commit first degree
    	
murder is the sentence for a Class X felony, except that
            (A) an attempt to commit first degree murder when
        	
at least one of the aggravating factors specified in paragraphs (1), (2), and (12) of subsection (b) of Section 9-1 is present is a Class X felony for which the sentence shall be a term of imprisonment of not less than 20 years and not more than 80 years;
            (B) an attempt to commit first degree murder
        	
while armed with a firearm is a Class X felony for which 15 years shall be added to the term of imprisonment imposed by the court;
            (C) an attempt to commit first degree murder
        	
during which the person personally discharged a firearm is a Class X felony for which 20 years shall be added to the term of imprisonment imposed by the court;
            (D) an attempt to commit first degree murder
        	
during which the person personally discharged a firearm that proximately caused great bodily harm, permanent disability, permanent disfigurement, or death to another person is a Class X felony for which 25 years or up to a term of natural life shall be added to the term of imprisonment imposed by the court; and
            (E) if the defendant proves by a preponderance of
        	
the evidence at sentencing that, at the time of the attempted murder, he or she was acting under a sudden and intense passion resulting from serious provocation by the individual whom the defendant endeavored to kill, or another, and, had the individual the defendant endeavored to kill died, the defendant would have negligently or accidentally caused that death, then the sentence for the attempted murder is the sentence for a Class 1 felony;
        (2) the sentence for attempt to commit a Class X
    	
felony is the sentence for a Class 1 felony;
        (3) the sentence for attempt to commit a Class 1
    	
felony is the sentence for a Class 2 felony;
        (4) the sentence for attempt to commit a Class 2
    	
felony is the sentence for a Class 3 felony; and
        (5) the sentence for attempt to commit any felony
    	
other than those specified in items (1), (2), (3), and (4) of this subsection (c) is the sentence for a Class A misdemeanor.

or more individuals under subsection (a) of this Section or under any law of the United States or of any state which is substantially similar to subsection (a) of this Section regardless of whether the deaths occurred as the result of the same act or of several related or unrelated acts so long as the deaths were the result of either an intent to kill more than one person or of separate acts which the defendant knew would cause death or create a strong probability of death or great bodily harm to the murdered individual or another; or
        (4) the murdered individual was killed as a result of

        (9) the defendant, while committing an offense

        (10) the defendant was incarcerated in an institution

        (14) the murder was intentional and involved the

congregation engaged in prayer or other religious activities at a church, synagogue, mosque, or other building, structure, or place used for religious worship.
    (b-5) Aggravating Factor; Natural Life Imprisonment. A defendant who has been found guilty of first degree murder and who at the time of the commission of the offense had attained the age of 18 years or more may be sentenced to natural life imprisonment if (i) the murdered individual was a physician, physician assistant, psychologist, nurse, or advanced practice registered nurse, (ii) the defendant knew or should have known that the murdered individual was a physician, physician assistant, psychologist, nurse, or advanced practice registered nurse, and (iii) the murdered individual was killed in the course of acting in his or her capacity as a physician, physician assistant, psychologist, nurse, or advanced practice registered nurse, or to prevent him or her from acting in that capacity, or in retaliation for his or her acting in that capacity.
    (c) Consideration of factors in Aggravation and Mitigation.
    The court shall consider, or shall instruct the jury to consider any aggravating and any mitigating factors which are relevant to the imposition of the death penalty. Aggravating factors may include but need not be limited to those factors set forth in subsection (b). Mitigating factors may include but need not be limited to the following:
        (1) the defendant has no significant history of prior
    	
criminal activity;
        (2) the murder was committed while the defendant was
    	
under the influence of extreme mental or emotional disturbance, although not such as to constitute a defense to prosecution;
        (3) the murdered individual was a participant in the
    	
defendant's homicidal conduct or consented to the homicidal act;
        (4) the defendant acted under the compulsion of
    	
threat or menace of the imminent infliction of death or great bodily harm;
        (5) the defendant was not personally present during
    	
commission of the act or acts causing death;
        (6) the defendant's background includes a history of
    	
extreme emotional or physical abuse;
        (7) the defendant suffers from a reduced mental
    	
capacity.
    Provided, however, that an action that does not otherwise mitigate first degree murder cannot qualify as a mitigating factor for first degree murder because of the discovery, knowledge, or disclosure of the victim's sexual orientation as defined in Section 1-103 of the Illinois Human Rights Act.
    (d) Separate sentencing hearing.
    Where requested by the State, the court shall conduct a separate sentencing proceeding to determine the existence of factors set forth in subsection (b) and to consider any aggravating or mitigating factors as indicated in subsection (c). The proceeding shall be conducted:
        (1) before the jury that determined the defendant's
    	
guilt; or
        (2) before a jury impanelled for the purpose of the
    	
proceeding if:
            A. the defendant was convicted upon a plea of
        	
guilty; or
            B. the defendant was convicted after a trial
        	
before the court sitting without a jury; or
            C. the court for good cause shown discharges the
        	
jury that determined the defendant's guilt; or
        (3) before the court alone if the defendant waives a
    	
jury for the separate proceeding.
    (e) Evidence and Argument.
    During the proceeding any information relevant to any of the factors set forth in subsection (b) may be presented by either the State or the defendant under the rules governing the admission of evidence at criminal trials. Any information relevant to any additional aggravating factors or any mitigating factors indicated in subsection (c) may be presented by the State or defendant regardless of its admissibility under the rules governing the admission of evidence at criminal trials. The State and the defendant shall be given fair opportunity to rebut any information received at the hearing.
    (f) Proof.
    The burden of proof of establishing the existence of any of the factors set forth in subsection (b) is on the State and shall not be satisfied unless established beyond a reasonable doubt.
    (g) Procedure - Jury.
    If at the separate sentencing proceeding the jury finds that none of the factors set forth in subsection (b) exists, the court shall sentence the defendant to a term of imprisonment under Chapter V of the Unified Code of Corrections. If there is a unanimous finding by the jury that one or more of the factors set forth in subsection (b) exist, the jury shall consider aggravating and mitigating factors as instructed by the court and shall determine whether the sentence of death shall be imposed. If the jury determines unanimously, after weighing the factors in aggravation and mitigation, that death is the appropriate sentence, the court shall sentence the defendant to death. If the court does not concur with the jury determination that death is the appropriate sentence, the court shall set forth reasons in writing including what facts or circumstances the court relied upon, along with any relevant documents, that compelled the court to non-concur with the sentence. This document and any attachments shall be part of the record for appellate review. The court shall be bound by the jury's sentencing determination.
    If after weighing the factors in aggravation and mitigation, one or more jurors determines that death is not the appropriate sentence, the court shall sentence the defendant to a term of imprisonment under Chapter V of the Unified Code of Corrections.
    (h) Procedure - No Jury.
    In a proceeding before the court alone, if the court finds that none of the factors found in subsection (b) exists, the court shall sentence the defendant to a term of imprisonment under Chapter V of the Unified Code of Corrections.
    If the Court determines that one or more of the factors set forth in subsection (b) exists, the Court shall consider any aggravating and mitigating factors as indicated in subsection (c). If the Court determines, after weighing the factors in aggravation and mitigation, that death is the appropriate sentence, the Court shall sentence the defendant to death.
    If the court finds that death is not the appropriate sentence, the court shall sentence the defendant to a term of imprisonment under Chapter V of the Unified Code of Corrections.
    (h-5) Decertification as a capital case.
    In a case in which the defendant has been found guilty of first degree murder by a judge or jury, or a case on remand for resentencing, and the State seeks the death penalty as an appropriate sentence, on the court's own motion or the written motion of the defendant, the court may decertify the case as a death penalty case if the court finds that the only evidence supporting the defendant's conviction is the uncorroborated testimony of an informant witness, as defined in Section 115-21 of the Code of Criminal Procedure of 1963, concerning the confession or admission of the defendant or that the sole evidence against the defendant is a single eyewitness or single accomplice without any other corroborating evidence. If the court decertifies the case as a capital case under either of the grounds set forth above, the court shall issue a written finding. The State may pursue its right to appeal the decertification pursuant to Supreme Court Rule 604(a)(1). If the court does not decertify the case as a capital case, the matter shall proceed to the eligibility phase of the sentencing hearing.
    (i) Appellate Procedure.
    The conviction and sentence of death shall be subject to automatic review by the Supreme Court. Such review shall be in accordance with rules promulgated by the Supreme Court. The Illinois Supreme Court may overturn the death sentence, and order the imposition of imprisonment under Chapter V of the Unified Code of Corrections if the court finds that the death sentence is fundamentally unjust as applied to the particular case. If the Illinois Supreme Court finds that the death sentence is fundamentally unjust as applied to the particular case, independent of any procedural grounds for relief, the Illinois Supreme Court shall issue a written opinion explaining this finding.
    (j) Disposition of reversed death sentence.
    In the event that the death penalty in this Act is held to be unconstitutional by the Supreme Court of the United States or of the State of Illinois, any person convicted of first degree murder shall be sentenced by the court to a term of imprisonment under Chapter V of the Unified Code of Corrections.
    In the event that any death sentence pursuant to the sentencing provisions of this Section is declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court of the United States or of the State of Illinois, the court having jurisdiction over a person previously sentenced to death shall cause the defendant to be brought before the court, and the court shall sentence the defendant to a term of imprisonment under Chapter V of the Unified Code of Corrections.
    (k) Guidelines for seeking the death penalty.
    The Attorney General and State's Attorneys Association shall consult on voluntary guidelines for procedures governing whether or not to seek the death penalty. The guidelines do not have the force of law and are only advisory in nature.

        (14) the murder was intentional and involved the
    	
infliction of torture. For the purpose of this Section torture means the infliction of or subjection to extreme physical pain, motivated by an intent to increase or prolong the pain, suffering or agony of the victim; or
        (15) the murder was committed as a result of the
    	
intentional discharge of a firearm by the defendant from a motor vehicle and the victim was not present within the motor vehicle; or
        (16) the murdered individual was 60 years of age or
    	
older and the death resulted from exceptionally brutal or heinous behavior indicative of wanton cruelty; or
        (17) the murdered individual was a person with a
    	
disability and the defendant knew or should have known that the murdered individual was a person with a disability. For purposes of this paragraph (17), "person with a disability" means a person who suffers from a permanent physical or mental impairment resulting from disease, an injury, a functional disorder, or a congenital condition that renders the person incapable of adequately providing for his or her own health or personal care; or
        (18) the murder was committed by reason of any
    	
person's activity as a community policing volunteer or to prevent any person from engaging in activity as a community policing volunteer; or
        (19) the murdered individual was subject to an order
    	
of protection and the murder was committed by a person against whom the same order of protection was issued under the Illinois Domestic Violence Act of 1986; or
        (20) the murdered individual was known by the
    	
defendant to be a teacher or other person employed in any school and the teacher or other employee is upon the grounds of a school or grounds adjacent to a school, or is in any part of a building used for school purposes; or
        (21) the murder was committed by the defendant in
    	
connection with or as a result of the offense of terrorism as defined in Section 29D-14.9 of this Code; or
        (22) the murdered individual was a member of a
    	
congregation engaged in prayer or other religious activities at a church, synagogue, mosque, or other building, structure, or place used for religious worship.
    (b-5) Aggravating Factor; Natural Life Imprisonment. A defendant who has been found guilty of first degree murder and who at the time of the commission of the offense had attained the age of 18 years or more may be sentenced to natural life imprisonment if (i) the murdered individual was a physician, physician assistant, psychologist, nurse, or advanced practice registered nurse, (ii) the defendant knew or should have known that the murdered individual was a physician, physician assistant, psychologist, nurse, or advanced practice registered nurse, and (iii) the murdered individual was killed in the course of acting in his or her capacity as a physician, physician assistant, psychologist, nurse, or advanced practice registered nurse, or to prevent him or her from acting in that capacity, or in retaliation for his or her acting in that capacity.
    (c) Consideration of factors in Aggravation and Mitigation.
    The court shall consider, or shall instruct the jury to consider any aggravating and any mitigating factors which are relevant to the imposition of the death penalty. Aggravating factors may include but need not be limited to those factors set forth in subsection (b). Mitigating factors may include but need not be limited to the following:
        (1) the defendant has no significant history of prior
    	
criminal activity;
        (2) the murder was committed while the defendant was
    	
under the influence of extreme mental or emotional disturbance, although not such as to constitute a defense to prosecution;
        (3) the murdered individual was a participant in the
    	
defendant's homicidal conduct or consented to the homicidal act;
        (4) the defendant acted under the compulsion of
    	
threat or menace of the imminent infliction of death or great bodily harm;
        (5) the defendant was not personally present during
    	
commission of the act or acts causing death;
        (6) the defendant's background includes a history of
    	
extreme emotional or physical abuse;
        (7) the defendant suffers from a reduced mental
    	
capacity.
    Provided, however, that an action that does not otherwise mitigate first degree murder cannot qualify as a mitigating factor for first degree murder because of the discovery, knowledge, or disclosure of the victim's sexual orientation as defined in Section 1-103 of the Illinois Human Rights Act.
    (d) Separate sentencing hearing.
    Where requested by the State, the court shall conduct a separate sentencing proceeding to determine the existence of factors set forth in subsection (b) and to consider any aggravating or mitigating factors as indicated in subsection (c). The proceeding shall be conducted:
        (1) before the jury that determined the defendant's
    	
guilt; or
        (2) before a jury impanelled for the purpose of the
    	
proceeding if:
            A. the defendant was convicted upon a plea of
        	
guilty; or
            B. the defendant was convicted after a trial
        	
before the court sitting without a jury; or
            C. the court for good cause shown discharges the
        	
jury that determined the defendant's guilt; or
        (3) before the court alone if the defendant waives a
    	
jury for the separate proceeding.
    (e) Evidence and Argument.
    During the proceeding any information relevant to any of the factors set forth in subsection (b) may be presented by either the State or the defendant under the rules governing the admission of evidence at criminal trials. Any information relevant to any additional aggravating factors or any mitigating factors indicated in subsection (c) may be presented by the State or defendant regardless of its admissibility under the rules governing the admission of evidence at criminal trials. The State and the defendant shall be given fair opportunity to rebut any information received at the hearing.
    (f) Proof.
    The burden of proof of establishing the existence of any of the factors set forth in subsection (b) is on the State and shall not be satisfied unless established beyond a reasonable doubt.
    (g) Procedure - Jury.
    If at the separate sentencing proceeding the jury finds that none of the factors set forth in subsection (b) exists, the court shall sentence the defendant to a term of imprisonment under Chapter V of the Unified Code of Corrections. If there is a unanimous finding by the jury that one or more of the factors set forth in subsection (b) exist, the jury shall consider aggravating and mitigating factors as instructed by the court and shall determine whether the sentence of death shall be imposed. If the jury determines unanimously, after weighing the factors in aggravation and mitigation, that death is the appropriate sentence, the court shall sentence the defendant to death. If the court does not concur with the jury determination that death is the appropriate sentence, the court shall set forth reasons in writing including what facts or circumstances the court relied upon, along with any relevant documents, that compelled the court to non-concur with the sentence. This document and any attachments shall be part of the record for appellate review. The court shall be bound by the jury's sentencing determination.
    If after weighing the factors in aggravation and mitigation, one or more jurors determines that death is not the appropriate sentence, the court shall sentence the defendant to a term of imprisonment under Chapter V of the Unified Code of Corrections.
    (h) Procedure - No Jury.
    In a proceeding before the court alone, if the court finds that none of the factors found in subsection (b) exists, the court shall sentence the defendant to a term of imprisonment under Chapter V of the Unified Code of Corrections.
    If the Court determines that one or more of the factors set forth in subsection (b) exists, the Court shall consider any aggravating and mitigating factors as indicated in subsection (c). If the Court determines, after weighing the factors in aggravation and mitigation, that death is the appropriate sentence, the Court shall sentence the defendant to death.
    If the court finds that death is not the appropriate sentence, the court shall sentence the defendant to a term of imprisonment under Chapter V of the Unified Code of Corrections.
    (h-5) Decertification as a capital case.
    In a case in which the defendant has been found guilty of first degree murder by a judge or jury, or a case on remand for resentencing, and the State seeks the death penalty as an appropriate sentence, on the court's own motion or the written motion of the defendant, the court may decertify the case as a death penalty case if the court finds that the only evidence supporting the defendant's conviction is the uncorroborated testimony of an informant witness, as defined in Section 115-21 of the Code of Criminal Procedure of 1963, concerning the confession or admission of the defendant or that the sole evidence against the defendant is a single eyewitness or single accomplice without any other corroborating evidence. If the court decertifies the case as a capital case under either of the grounds set forth above, the court shall issue a written finding. The State may pursue its right to appeal the decertification pursuant to Supreme Court Rule 604(a)(1). If the court does not decertify the case as a capital case, the matter shall proceed to the eligibility phase of the sentencing hearing.
    (i) Appellate Procedure.
    The conviction and sentence of death shall be subject to automatic review by the Supreme Court. Such review shall be in accordance with rules promulgated by the Supreme Court. The Illinois Supreme Court may overturn the death sentence, and order the imposition of imprisonment under Chapter V of the Unified Code of Corrections if the court finds that the death sentence is fundamentally unjust as applied to the particular case. If the Illinois Supreme Court finds that the death sentence is fundamentally unjust as applied to the particular case, independent of any procedural grounds for relief, the Illinois Supreme Court shall issue a written opinion explaining this finding.
    (j) Disposition of reversed death sentence.
    In the event that the death penalty in this Act is held to be unconstitutional by the Supreme Court of the United States or of the State of Illinois, any person convicted of first degree murder shall be sentenced by the court to a term of imprisonment under Chapter V of the Unified Code of Corrections.
    In the event that any death sentence pursuant to the sentencing provisions of this Section is declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court of the United States or of the State of Illinois, the court having jurisdiction over a person previously sentenced to death shall cause the defendant to be brought before the court, and the court shall sentence the defendant to a term of imprisonment under Chapter V of the Unified Code of Corrections.
    (k) Guidelines for seeking the death penalty.
    The Attorney General and State's Attorneys Association shall consult on voluntary guidelines for procedures governing whether or not to seek the death penalty. The guidelines do not have the force of law and are only advisory in nature.

    Sec. 9-1.2. Intentional homicide of an unborn child.
    (a) A person commits the offense of intentional homicide of an unborn child if, in performing acts which cause the death of an unborn child, he without lawful justification:
        (1) either intended to cause the death of or do great
    	
bodily harm to the pregnant individual or unborn child or knew that such acts would cause death or great bodily harm to the pregnant individual or unborn child; or
        (2) knew that his acts created a strong probability
    	
of death or great bodily harm to the pregnant individual or unborn child; and
        (3) knew that the individual was pregnant.
    (b) For purposes of this Section, (1) "unborn child" shall mean any individual of the human species from the implantation of an embryo until birth, and (2) "person" shall not include the pregnant woman whose unborn child is killed.
    (c) This Section shall not apply to acts which cause the death of an unborn child if those acts were committed during any abortion, as defined in Section 1-10 of the Reproductive Health Act, to which the pregnant individual has consented. This Section shall not apply to acts which were committed pursuant to usual and customary standards of medical practice during diagnostic testing or therapeutic treatment.
    (d) Penalty. The sentence for intentional homicide of an unborn child shall be the same as for first degree murder, except that:
        (1) the death penalty may not be imposed;
        (2) if the person committed the offense while armed
    	
with a firearm, 15 years shall be added to the term of imprisonment imposed by the court;
        (3) if, during the commission of the offense, the
    	
person personally discharged a firearm, 20 years shall be added to the term of imprisonment imposed by the court;
        (4) if, during the commission of the offense, the
    	
person personally discharged a firearm that proximately caused great bodily harm, permanent disability, permanent disfigurement, or death to another person, 25 years or up to a term of natural life shall be added to the term of imprisonment imposed by the court.
    (e) The provisions of this Act shall not be construed to prohibit the prosecution of any person under any other provision of law.

    (720 ILCS 5/9-2) (from Ch. 38, par. 9-2)
    Sec. 9-2. Second degree murder.
    (a) A person commits the offense of second degree murder when he or she commits the offense of first degree murder as defined in paragraph (1) or (2) of subsection (a) of Section 9-1 of this Code and either of the following mitigating factors are present:
        (1) at the time of the killing he or she is acting
    	
under a sudden and intense passion resulting from serious provocation by the individual killed or another whom the offender endeavors to kill, but he or she negligently or accidentally causes the death of the individual killed; or
        (2) at the time of the killing he or she believes the
    	
circumstances to be such that, if they existed, would justify or exonerate the killing under the principles stated in Article 7 of this Code, but his or her belief is unreasonable.
    (b) Serious provocation is conduct sufficient to excite an intense passion in a reasonable person provided, however, that an action that does not otherwise constitute serious provocation cannot qualify as serious provocation because of the discovery, knowledge, or disclosure of the victim's sexual orientation as defined in Section 1-103 of the Illinois Human Rights Act.
    (c) When evidence of either of the mitigating factors defined in subsection (a) of this Section has been presented, the burden of proof is on the defendant to prove either mitigating factor by a preponderance of the evidence before the defendant can be found guilty of second degree murder. The burden of proof, however, remains on the State to prove beyond a reasonable doubt each of the elements of first degree murder and, when appropriately raised, the absence of circumstances at the time of the killing that would justify or exonerate the killing under the principles stated in Article 7 of this Code.
    (d) Sentence. Second degree murder is a Class 1 felony.

    Serious provocation is conduct sufficient to excite an intense passion in a reasonable person.
    (b) A person who intentionally or knowingly kills an unborn child commits voluntary manslaughter of an unborn child if at the time of the killing he believes the circumstances to be such that, if they existed, would justify or exonerate the killing under the principles stated in Article 7 of this Code, but his belief is unreasonable.

    (720 ILCS 5/10-5) (from Ch. 38, par. 10-5)
    Sec. 10-5. Child abduction.
    (a) For purposes of this Section, the following terms have the following meanings:
        (1) "Child" means a person who, at the time the
    	
alleged violation occurred, was under the age of 18 or was a person with a severe or profound intellectual disability.
        (2) "Detains" means taking or retaining physical
    	
custody of a child, whether or not the child resists or objects.
        (2.1) "Express consent" means oral or written
    	
permission that is positive, direct, and unequivocal, requiring no inference or implication to supply its meaning.
        (2.2) "Luring" means any knowing act to solicit,
    	
entice, tempt, or attempt to attract the minor.
        (3) "Lawful custodian" means a person or persons
    	
granted legal custody of a child or entitled to physical possession of a child pursuant to a court order. It is presumed that, when the parties have never been married to each other, the mother has legal custody of the child unless a valid court order states otherwise. If an adjudication of paternity has been completed and the father has been assigned support obligations or visitation rights, such a paternity order should, for the purposes of this Section, be considered a valid court order granting custody to the mother.
        (4) "Putative father" means a man who has a
    	
reasonable belief that he is the father of a child born of a woman who is not his wife.
        (5) "Unlawful purpose" means any misdemeanor or
    	
felony violation of State law or a similar federal or sister state law or local ordinance.
    (b) A person commits the offense of child abduction when he or she does any one of the following:
        (1) Intentionally violates any terms of a valid court
    	
order granting sole or joint custody, care, or possession to another by concealing or detaining the child or removing the child from the jurisdiction of the court.
        (2) Intentionally violates a court order prohibiting
    	
the person from concealing or detaining the child or removing the child from the jurisdiction of the court.
        (3) Intentionally conceals, detains, or removes the
    	
child without the consent of the mother or lawful custodian of the child if the person is a putative father and either: (A) the paternity of the child has not been legally established or (B) the paternity of the child has been legally established but no orders relating to custody have been entered. Notwithstanding the presumption created by paragraph (3) of subsection (a), however, a mother commits child abduction when she intentionally conceals or removes a child, whom she has abandoned or relinquished custody of, from an unadjudicated father who has provided sole ongoing care and custody of the child in her absence.
        (4) Intentionally conceals or removes the child from
    	
a parent after filing a petition or being served with process in an action affecting marriage or paternity but prior to the issuance of a temporary or final order determining custody.
        (5) At the expiration of visitation rights outside
    	
the State, intentionally fails or refuses to return or impedes the return of the child to the lawful custodian in Illinois.
        (6) Being a parent of the child, and if the parents
    	
of that child are or have been married and there has been no court order of custody, knowingly conceals the child for 15 days, and fails to make reasonable attempts within the 15-day period to notify the other parent as to the specific whereabouts of the child, including a means by which to contact the child, or to arrange reasonable visitation or contact with the child. It is not a violation of this Section for a person fleeing domestic violence to take the child with him or her to housing provided by a domestic violence program.
        (7) Being a parent of the child, and if the parents
    	
of the child are or have been married and there has been no court order of custody, knowingly conceals, detains, or removes the child with physical force or threat of physical force.
        (8) Knowingly conceals, detains, or removes the child
    	
for payment or promise of payment at the instruction of a person who has no legal right to custody.
        (9) Knowingly retains in this State for 30 days a
    	
child removed from another state without the consent of the lawful custodian or in violation of a valid court order of custody.
        (10) Intentionally lures or attempts to lure a child:
    	
(A) under the age of 17 or (B) while traveling to or from a primary or secondary school into a motor vehicle, building, housetrailer, or dwelling place without the consent of the child's parent or lawful custodian for other than a lawful purpose. For the purposes of this item (10), the trier of fact may infer that luring or attempted luring of a child under the age of 17 into a motor vehicle, building, housetrailer, or dwelling place without the express consent of the child's parent or lawful custodian or with the intent to avoid the express consent of the child's parent or lawful custodian was for other than a lawful purpose.
        (11) With the intent to obstruct or prevent efforts
    	
to locate the child victim of a child abduction, knowingly destroys, alters, conceals, or disguises physical evidence or furnishes false information.
    (c) It is an affirmative defense to subsections (b)(1) through (b)(10) of this Section that:
        (1) the person had custody of the child pursuant to a
    	
court order granting legal custody or visitation rights that existed at the time of the alleged violation;
        (2) the person had physical custody of the child
    	
pursuant to a court order granting legal custody or visitation rights and failed to return the child as a result of circumstances beyond his or her control, and the person notified and disclosed to the other parent or legal custodian the specific whereabouts of the child and a means by which the child could be contacted or made a reasonable attempt to notify the other parent or lawful custodian of the child of those circumstances and made the disclosure within 24 hours after the visitation period had expired and returned the child as soon as possible;
        (3) the person was fleeing an incidence or pattern of
    	
domestic violence; or
        (4) the person lured or attempted to lure a child
    	
under the age of 17 into a motor vehicle, building, housetrailer, or dwelling place for a lawful purpose in prosecutions under paragraph (10) of subsection (b).
    (d) A person convicted of child abduction under this Section is guilty of a Class 4 felony. A person convicted of child abduction under subsection (b)(10) shall undergo a sex offender evaluation prior to a sentence being imposed. A person convicted of a second or subsequent violation of paragraph (10) of subsection (b) of this Section is guilty of a Class 3 felony. A person convicted of child abduction under subsection (b)(10) when the person has a prior conviction of a sex offense as defined in the Sex Offender Registration Act or any substantially similar federal, Uniform Code of Military Justice, sister state, or foreign government offense is guilty of a Class 2 felony. It is a factor in aggravation under subsections (b)(1) through (b)(10) of this Section for which a court may impose a more severe sentence under Section 5-8-1 (730 ILCS 5/5-8-1) or Article 4.5 of Chapter V of the Unified Code of Corrections if, upon sentencing, the court finds evidence of any of the following aggravating factors:
        (1) that the defendant abused or neglected the child
    	
following the concealment, detention, or removal of the child;
        (2) that the defendant inflicted or threatened to
    	
inflict physical harm on a parent or lawful custodian of the child or on the child with intent to cause that parent or lawful custodian to discontinue criminal prosecution of the defendant under this Section;
        (3) that the defendant demanded payment in exchange
    	
for return of the child or demanded that he or she be relieved of the financial or legal obligation to support the child in exchange for return of the child;
        (4) that the defendant has previously been convicted
    	
of child abduction;
        (5) that the defendant committed the abduction while
    	
armed with a deadly weapon or the taking of the child resulted in serious bodily injury to another; or
        (6) that the defendant committed the abduction while
    	
in a school, regardless of the time of day or time of year; in a playground; on any conveyance owned, leased, or contracted by a school to transport students to or from school or a school related activity; on the real property of a school; or on a public way within 1,000 feet of the real property comprising any school or playground. For purposes of this paragraph (6), "playground" means a piece of land owned or controlled by a unit of local government that is designated by the unit of local government for use solely or primarily for children's recreation; and "school" means a public or private elementary or secondary school, community college, college, or university.
    (e) The court may order the child to be returned to the parent or lawful custodian from whom the child was concealed, detained, or removed. In addition to any sentence imposed, the court may assess any reasonable expense incurred in searching for or returning the child against any person convicted of violating this Section.
    (f) Nothing contained in this Section shall be construed to limit the court's contempt power.
    (g) Every law enforcement officer investigating an alleged incident of child abduction shall make a written police report of any bona fide allegation and the disposition of that investigation. Every police report completed pursuant to this Section shall be compiled and recorded within the meaning of Section 5.1 of the Criminal Identification Act.
    (h) Whenever a law enforcement officer has reasons to believe a child abduction has occurred, she or he shall provide the lawful custodian a summary of her or his rights under this Code, including the procedures and relief available to her or him.
    (i) If during the course of an investigation under this Section the child is found in the physical custody of the defendant or another, the law enforcement officer shall return the child to the parent or lawful custodian from whom the child was concealed, detained, or removed, unless there is good cause for the law enforcement officer or the Department of Children and Family Services to retain temporary protective custody of the child pursuant to the Abused and Neglected Child Reporting Act.

    Sec. 11-18.1. Patronizing a minor engaged in prostitution.
    (a) Any person who engages in an act of sexual penetration as defined in Section 11-0.1 of this Code with a person engaged in prostitution who is under 18 years of age or is a person with a severe or profound intellectual disability commits patronizing a minor engaged in prostitution.
    (a-5) Any person who engages in any touching or fondling, with a person engaged in prostitution who either is under 18 years of age or is a person with a severe or profound intellectual disability, of the sex organs of one person by the other person, with the intent to achieve sexual arousal or gratification, commits patronizing a minor engaged in prostitution.
    (b) It is an affirmative defense to the charge of patronizing a minor engaged in prostitution that the accused reasonably believed that the person was of the age of 18 years or over or was not a person with a severe or profound intellectual disability at the time of the act giving rise to the charge.
    (c) Sentence. A person who commits patronizing a juvenile prostitute is guilty of a Class 3 felony, unless committed within 1,000 feet of real property comprising a school, in which case it is a Class 2 felony. A person convicted of a second or subsequent violation of this Section, or of any combination of such number of convictions under this Section and Sections 11-14 (prostitution), 11-14.1 (solicitation of a sexual act), 11-14.3 (promoting prostitution), 11-14.4 (promoting juvenile prostitution), 11-15 (soliciting for a prostitute), 11-15.1 (soliciting for a juvenile prostitute), 11-16 (pandering), 11-17 (keeping a place of prostitution), 11-17.1 (keeping a place of juvenile prostitution), 11-18 (patronizing a prostitute), 11-19 (pimping), 11-19.1 (juvenile pimping or aggravated juvenile pimping), or 11-19.2 (exploitation of a child) of this Code, is guilty of a Class 2 felony.

SUBDIVISION 20. PORNOGRAPHY OFFENSES
(Source: P.A. 96-1551, eff. 7-1-11.)

    (720 ILCS 5/11-20) (from Ch. 38, par. 11-20)
    Sec. 11-20. Obscenity.
    (a) Elements of the Offense. A person commits obscenity when, with knowledge of the nature or content thereof, or recklessly failing to exercise reasonable inspection which would have disclosed the nature or content thereof, he or she:
        (1) Sells, delivers or provides, or offers or agrees
    	
to sell, deliver or provide any obscene writing, picture, record or other representation or embodiment of the obscene; or
        (2) Presents or directs an obscene play, dance or
    	
other performance or participates directly in that portion thereof which makes it obscene; or
        (3) Publishes, exhibits or otherwise makes available
    	
anything obscene; or
        (4) Performs an obscene act or otherwise presents an
    	
obscene exhibition of his or her body for gain; or
        (5) Creates, buys, procures or possesses obscene
    	
matter or material with intent to disseminate it in violation of this Section, or of the penal laws or regulations of any other jurisdiction; or
        (6) Advertises or otherwise promotes the sale of
    	
material represented or held out by him or her to be obscene, whether or not it is obscene.
    (b) Obscene Defined.
    Any material or performance is obscene if: (1) the average person, applying contemporary adult community standards, would find that, taken as a whole, it appeals to the prurient interest; and (2) the average person, applying contemporary adult community standards, would find that it depicts or describes, in a patently offensive way, ultimate sexual acts or sadomasochistic sexual acts, whether normal or perverted, actual or simulated, or masturbation, excretory functions or lewd exhibition of the genitals; and (3) taken as a whole, it lacks serious literary, artistic, political or scientific value.
    (c) Interpretation of Evidence.
    Obscenity shall be judged with reference to ordinary adults, except that it shall be judged with reference to children or other specially susceptible audiences if it appears from the character of the material or the circumstances of its dissemination to be specially designed for or directed to such an audience.
    Where circumstances of production, presentation, sale, dissemination, distribution, or publicity indicate that material is being commercially exploited for the sake of its prurient appeal, such evidence is probative with respect to the nature of the matter and can justify the conclusion that the matter is lacking in serious literary, artistic, political or scientific value.
    In any prosecution for an offense under this Section evidence shall be admissible to show:
        (1) The character of the audience for which the
    	
material was designed or to which it was directed;
        (2) What the predominant appeal of the material would
    	
be for ordinary adults or a special audience, and what effect, if any, it would probably have on the behavior of such people;
        (3) The artistic, literary, scientific, educational
    	
or other merits of the material, or absence thereof;
        (4) The degree, if any, of public acceptance of the
    	
material in this State;
        (5) Appeal to prurient interest, or absence thereof,
    	
in advertising or other promotion of the material;
        (6) Purpose of the author, creator, publisher or
    	
disseminator.
    (d) Sentence.
    Obscenity is a Class A misdemeanor. A second or subsequent offense is a Class 4 felony.
    (e) Permissive Inference.
    The trier of fact may infer an intent to disseminate from the creation, purchase, procurement or possession of a mold, engraved plate or other embodiment of obscenity specially adapted for reproducing multiple copies, or the possession of more than 3 copies of obscene material.
    (f) Affirmative Defenses.
    It shall be an affirmative defense to obscenity that the dissemination:
        (1) Was not for gain and was made to personal
    	
associates other than children under 18 years of age;
        (2) Was to institutions or individuals having
    	
scientific or other special justification for possession of such material.
    (g) Forfeiture of property. A person who has been convicted previously of the offense of obscenity and who is convicted of a second or subsequent offense of obscenity is subject to the property forfeiture provisions set forth in Article 124B of the Code of Criminal Procedure of 1963.

        (1) films, videotapes, photographs, or otherwise

        (2) with the knowledge of the nature or content
    	
thereof, reproduces, disseminates, offers to disseminate, exhibits or possesses with intent to disseminate any film, videotape, photograph or other similar visual reproduction or depiction by computer of any child or person with a severe or profound intellectual disability whom the person knows or reasonably should know to be under the age of 18 or to be a person with a severe or profound intellectual disability, engaged in any activity described in subparagraphs (i) through (vii) of paragraph (1) of this subsection; or
        (3) with knowledge of the subject matter or theme
    	
thereof, produces any stage play, live performance, film, videotape or other similar visual portrayal or depiction by computer which includes a child whom the person knows or reasonably should know to be under the age of 18 or a person with a severe or profound intellectual disability engaged in any activity described in subparagraphs (i) through (vii) of paragraph (1) of this subsection; or
        (4) solicits, uses, persuades, induces, entices, or

        (5) is a parent, step-parent, legal guardian or other
    	
person having care or custody of a child whom the person knows or reasonably should know to be under the age of 18 or a person with a severe or profound intellectual disability and who knowingly permits, induces, promotes, or arranges for such child or person with a severe or profound intellectual disability to appear in any stage play, live performance, film, videotape, photograph or other similar visual presentation, portrayal or simulation or depiction by computer of any act or activity described in subparagraphs (i) through (vii) of paragraph (1) of this subsection; or
        (6) with knowledge of the nature or content thereof,
    	
possesses any film, videotape, photograph or other similar visual reproduction or depiction by computer of any child or person with a severe or profound intellectual disability whom the person knows or reasonably should know to be under the age of 18 or to be a person with a severe or profound intellectual disability, engaged in any activity described in subparagraphs (i) through (vii) of paragraph (1) of this subsection; or
        (7) solicits, or knowingly uses, persuades, induces,
    	
entices, or coerces, a person to provide a child under the age of 18 or a person with a severe or profound intellectual disability to appear in any videotape, photograph, film, stage play, live presentation, or other similar visual reproduction or depiction by computer in which the child or person with a severe or profound intellectual disability will be depicted, actually or by simulation, in any act, pose, or setting described in subparagraphs (i) through (vii) of paragraph (1) of this subsection.
    (a-5) The possession of each individual film, videotape, photograph, or other similar visual reproduction or depiction by computer in violation of this Section constitutes a single and separate violation. This subsection (a-5) does not apply to multiple copies of the same film, videotape, photograph, or other similar visual reproduction or depiction by computer that are identical to each other.
    (b)(1) It shall be an affirmative defense to a charge of child pornography that the defendant reasonably believed, under all of the circumstances, that the child was 18 years of age or older or that the person was not a person with a severe or profound intellectual disability but only where, prior to the act or acts giving rise to a prosecution under this Section, he or she took some affirmative action or made a bonafide inquiry designed to ascertain whether the child was 18 years of age or older or that the person was not a person with a severe or profound intellectual disability and his or her reliance upon the information so obtained was clearly reasonable.
    (1.5) Telecommunications carriers, commercial mobile service providers, and providers of information services, including, but not limited to, Internet service providers and hosting service providers, are not liable under this Section by virtue of the transmission, storage, or caching of electronic communications or messages of others or by virtue of the provision of other related telecommunications, commercial mobile services, or information services used by others in violation of this Section.
    (2) (Blank).
    (3) The charge of child pornography shall not apply to the performance of official duties by law enforcement or prosecuting officers or persons employed by law enforcement or prosecuting agencies, court personnel or attorneys, nor to bonafide treatment or professional education programs conducted by licensed physicians, psychologists or social workers.
    (4) If the defendant possessed more than one of the same film, videotape or visual reproduction or depiction by computer in which child pornography is depicted, then the trier of fact may infer that the defendant possessed such materials with the intent to disseminate them.
    (5) The charge of child pornography does not apply to a person who does not voluntarily possess a film, videotape, or visual reproduction or depiction by computer in which child pornography is depicted. Possession is voluntary if the defendant knowingly procures or receives a film, videotape, or visual reproduction or depiction for a sufficient time to be able to terminate his or her possession.
    (6) Any violation of paragraph (1), (2), (3), (4), (5), or (7) of subsection (a) that includes a child engaged in, solicited for, depicted in, or posed in any act of sexual penetration or bound, fettered, or subject to sadistic, masochistic, or sadomasochistic abuse in a sexual context shall be deemed a crime of violence.
    (c) If the violation does not involve a film, videotape, or other moving depiction, a violation of paragraph (1), (4), (5), or (7) of subsection (a) is a Class 1 felony with a mandatory minimum fine of $2,000 and a maximum fine of $100,000. If the violation involves a film, videotape, or other moving depiction, a violation of paragraph (1), (4), (5), or (7) of subsection (a) is a Class X felony with a mandatory minimum fine of $2,000 and a maximum fine of $100,000. If the violation does not involve a film, videotape, or other moving depiction, a violation of paragraph (3) of subsection (a) is a Class 1 felony with a mandatory minimum fine of $1500 and a maximum fine of $100,000. If the violation involves a film, videotape, or other moving depiction, a violation of paragraph (3) of subsection (a) is a Class X felony with a mandatory minimum fine of $1500 and a maximum fine of $100,000. If the violation does not involve a film, videotape, or other moving depiction, a violation of paragraph (2) of subsection (a) is a Class 1 felony with a mandatory minimum fine of $1000 and a maximum fine of $100,000. If the violation involves a film, videotape, or other moving depiction, a violation of paragraph (2) of subsection (a) is a Class X felony with a mandatory minimum fine of $1000 and a maximum fine of $100,000. If the violation does not involve a film, videotape, or other moving depiction, a violation of paragraph (6) of subsection (a) is a Class 3 felony with a mandatory minimum fine of $1000 and a maximum fine of $100,000. If the violation involves a film, videotape, or other moving depiction, a violation of paragraph (6) of subsection (a) is a Class 2 felony with a mandatory minimum fine of $1000 and a maximum fine of $100,000.
    (c-5) Where the child depicted is under the age of 13, a violation of paragraph (1), (2), (3), (4), (5), or (7) of subsection (a) is a Class X felony with a mandatory minimum fine of $2,000 and a maximum fine of $100,000. Where the child depicted is under the age of 13, a violation of paragraph (6) of subsection (a) is a Class 2 felony with a mandatory minimum fine of $1,000 and a maximum fine of $100,000. Where the child depicted is under the age of 13, a person who commits a violation of paragraph (1), (2), (3), (4), (5), or (7) of subsection (a) where the defendant has previously been convicted under the laws of this State or any other state of the offense of child pornography, aggravated child pornography, aggravated criminal sexual abuse, aggravated criminal sexual assault, predatory criminal sexual assault of a child, or any of the offenses formerly known as rape, deviate sexual assault, indecent liberties with a child, or aggravated indecent liberties with a child where the victim was under the age of 18 years or an offense that is substantially equivalent to those offenses, is guilty of a Class X felony for which the person shall be sentenced to a term of imprisonment of not less than 9 years with a mandatory minimum fine of $2,000 and a maximum fine of $100,000. Where the child depicted is under the age of 13, a person who commits a violation of paragraph (6) of subsection (a) where the defendant has previously been convicted under the laws of this State or any other state of the offense of child pornography, aggravated child pornography, aggravated criminal sexual abuse, aggravated criminal sexual assault, predatory criminal sexual assault of a child, or any of the offenses formerly known as rape, deviate sexual assault, indecent liberties with a child, or aggravated indecent liberties with a child where the victim was under the age of 18 years or an offense that is substantially equivalent to those offenses, is guilty of a Class 1 felony with a mandatory minimum fine of $1,000 and a maximum fine of $100,000. The issue of whether the child depicted is under the age of 13 is an element of the offense to be resolved by the trier of fact.
    (d) If a person is convicted of a second or subsequent violation of this Section within 10 years of a prior conviction, the court shall order a presentence psychiatric examination of the person. The examiner shall report to the court whether treatment of the person is necessary.
    (e) Any film, videotape, photograph or other similar visual reproduction or depiction by computer which includes a child under the age of 18 or a person with a severe or profound intellectual disability engaged in any activity described in subparagraphs (i) through (vii) or paragraph 1 of subsection (a), and any material or equipment used or intended for use in photographing, filming, printing, producing, reproducing, manufacturing, projecting, exhibiting, depiction by computer, or disseminating such material shall be seized and forfeited in the manner, method and procedure provided by Section 36-1 of this Code for the seizure and forfeiture of vessels, vehicles and aircraft.
    In addition, any person convicted under this Section is subject to the property forfeiture provisions set forth in Article 124B of the Code of Criminal Procedure of 1963.
    (e-5) Upon the conclusion of a case brought under this Section, the court shall seal all evidence depicting a victim or witness that is sexually explicit. The evidence may be unsealed and viewed, on a motion of the party seeking to unseal and view the evidence, only for good cause shown and in the discretion of the court. The motion must expressly set forth the purpose for viewing the material. The State's attorney and the victim, if possible, shall be provided reasonable notice of the hearing on the motion to unseal the evidence. Any person entitled to notice of a hearing under this subsection (e-5) may object to the motion.
    (f) Definitions. For the purposes of this Section:
        (1) "Disseminate" means (i) to sell, distribute,

the meanings ascribed to them in Section 17.05 of this Code.
        (7) For the purposes of this Section, "child
    	
pornography" includes a film, videotape, photograph, or other similar visual medium or reproduction or depiction by computer that is, or appears to be, that of a person, either in part, or in total, under the age of 18 or a person with a severe or profound intellectual disability, regardless of the method by which the film, videotape, photograph, or other similar visual medium or reproduction or depiction by computer is created, adopted, or modified to appear as such. "Child pornography" also includes a film, videotape, photograph, or other similar visual medium or reproduction or depiction by computer that is advertised, promoted, presented, described, or distributed in such a manner that conveys the impression that the film, videotape, photograph, or other similar visual medium or reproduction or depiction by computer is of a person under the age of 18 or a person with a severe or profound intellectual disability.
    (g) Re-enactment; findings; purposes.
        (1) The General Assembly finds and declares that:
            (i) Section 50-5 of Public Act 88-680, effective
        	
January 1, 1995, contained provisions amending the child pornography statute, Section 11-20.1 of the Criminal Code of 1961. Section 50-5 also contained other provisions.
            (ii) In addition, Public Act 88-680 was entitled
        	
"AN ACT to create a Safe Neighborhoods Law". (A) Article 5 was entitled JUVENILE JUSTICE and amended the Juvenile Court Act of 1987. (B) Article 15 was entitled GANGS and amended various provisions of the Criminal Code of 1961 and the Unified Code of Corrections. (C) Article 20 was entitled ALCOHOL ABUSE and amended various provisions of the Illinois Vehicle Code. (D) Article 25 was entitled DRUG ABUSE and amended the Cannabis Control Act and the Illinois Controlled Substances Act. (E) Article 30 was entitled FIREARMS and amended the Criminal Code of 1961 and the Code of Criminal Procedure of 1963. (F) Article 35 amended the Criminal Code of 1961, the Rights of Crime Victims and Witnesses Act, and the Unified Code of Corrections. (G) Article 40 amended the Criminal Code of 1961 to increase the penalty for compelling organization membership of persons. (H) Article 45 created the Secure Residential Youth Care Facility Licensing Act and amended the State Finance Act, the Juvenile Court Act of 1987, the Unified Code of Corrections, and the Private Correctional Facility Moratorium Act. (I) Article 50 amended the WIC Vendor Management Act, the Firearm Owners Identification Card Act, the Juvenile Court Act of 1987, the Criminal Code of 1961, the Wrongs to Children Act, and the Unified Code of Corrections.
            (iii) On September 22, 1998, the Third District
        	
Appellate Court in People v. Dainty, 701 N.E. 2d 118, ruled that Public Act 88-680 violates the single subject clause of the Illinois Constitution (Article IV, Section 8 (d)) and was unconstitutional in its entirety. As of the time this amendatory Act of 1999 was prepared, People v. Dainty was still subject to appeal.
            (iv) Child pornography is a vital concern to the
        	
people of this State and the validity of future prosecutions under the child pornography statute of the Criminal Code of 1961 is in grave doubt.
        (2) It is the purpose of this amendatory Act of 1999
    	
to prevent or minimize any problems relating to prosecutions for child pornography that may result from challenges to the constitutional validity of Public Act 88-680 by re-enacting the Section relating to child pornography that was included in Public Act 88-680.
        (3) This amendatory Act of 1999 re-enacts Section
    	
11-20.1 of the Criminal Code of 1961, as it has been amended. This re-enactment is intended to remove any question as to the validity or content of that Section; it is not intended to supersede any other Public Act that amends the text of the Section as set forth in this amendatory Act of 1999. The material is shown as existing text (i.e., without underscoring) because, as of the time this amendatory Act of 1999 was prepared, People v. Dainty was subject to appeal to the Illinois Supreme Court.
        (4) The re-enactment by this amendatory Act of 1999
    	
of Section 11-20.1 of the Criminal Code of 1961 relating to child pornography that was amended by Public Act 88-680 is not intended, and shall not be construed, to imply that Public Act 88-680 is invalid or to limit or impair any legal argument concerning whether those provisions were substantially re-enacted by other Public Acts.

For purposes of this Section, "child" means a person under 18 years of age who is the defendant's or victim's child or step-child or who is a minor child residing within or visiting the household of the defendant or victim.
    (d) Upon conviction of domestic battery, the court shall advise the defendant orally or in writing, substantially as follows: "An individual convicted of domestic battery may be subject to federal criminal penalties for possessing, transporting, shipping, or receiving any firearm or ammunition in violation of the federal Gun Control Act of 1968 (18 U.S.C. 922(g)(8) and (9))."

    (a) In addition to any other remedies, the State's Attorney of the county where the residential property which endangers the health or safety of any person exists is authorized to file a complaint and apply to the circuit court for a temporary restraining order, and such circuit court shall upon hearing grant a temporary restraining order or a preliminary or permanent injunction, without bond, restraining any person who owns, manages, or has any equitable interest in the property, from collecting, receiving or benefiting from any rents or other monies available from the property, so long as the property remains in a condition which endangers the health or safety of any person.
    (b) The court may order any rents or other monies owed to be paid into an escrow account. The funds are to be paid out of the escrow account only to satisfy the reasonable cost of necessary repairs of the property which had been incurred or will be incurred in ameliorating the condition of the property as described in subsection (a), payment of delinquent real estate taxes on the property or payment of other legal debts relating to the property. The court may order that funds remain in escrow for a reasonable time after the completion of all necessary repairs to assure continued upkeep of the property and satisfaction of other outstanding legal debts of the property.
    (c) The owner shall be responsible for contracting to have necessary repairs completed and shall be required to submit all bills, together with certificates of completion, to the manager of the escrow account within 30 days after their receipt by the owner.
    (d) In contracting for any repairs required pursuant to this Section the owner of the property shall enter into a contract only after receiving bids from at least 3 independent contractors capable of making the necessary repairs. If the owner does not contract for the repairs with the lowest bidder, he shall file an affidavit with the court explaining why the lowest bid was not acceptable. At no time, under the provisions of this Section, shall the owner contract with anyone who is not a licensed contractor, except that a contractor need not be licensed if neither the State nor the county, township, or municipality where the residential real estate is located requires that the contractor be licensed. The court may order release of those funds in the escrow account that are in excess of the monies that the court determines to its satisfaction are needed to correct the condition of the property as described in subsection (a).
    For the purposes of this Section, "licensed contractor" means: (i) a contractor licensed by the State, if the State requires the licensure of the contractor; or (ii) a contractor licensed by the county, township, or municipality where the residential real estate is located, if that jurisdiction requires the licensure of the contractor.
    (e) The Clerk of the Circuit Court shall maintain a separate trust account entitled "Property Improvement Trust Account", which shall serve as the depository for the escrowed funds prescribed by this Section. The Clerk of the Court shall be responsible for the receipt, disbursement, monitoring and maintenance of all funds entrusted to this account, and shall provide to the court a quarterly accounting of the activities for any property, with funds in such account, unless the court orders accountings on a more frequent basis.
    The Clerk of the Circuit Court shall promulgate rules and procedures to administer the provisions of this Act.
    (f) Nothing in this Section shall in any way be construed to limit or alter any existing liability incurred, or to be incurred, by the owner or manager except as expressly provided in this Act. Nor shall anything in this Section be construed to create any liability on behalf of the Clerk of the Court, the State's Attorney's office or any other governmental agency involved in this action.
    Nor shall anything in this Section be construed to authorize tenants to refrain from paying rent.
    (g) Costs. As part of the costs of an action under this Section, the court shall assess a reasonable fee against the defendant to be paid to the Clerk of the Circuit Court. This amount is to be used solely for the maintenance of the Property Improvement Trust Account. No money obtained directly or indirectly from the property subject to the case may be used to satisfy this cost.
    (h) The municipal building department or other entity responsible for inspection of property and the enforcement of such local requirements shall, within 5 business days of a request by the State's Attorney, provide all documents requested, which shall include, but not be limited to, all records of inspections, permits and other information relating to any property.

        (8) If the placement of a child for adoption is made
    	
in accordance with the Interstate Compact on the Placement of Children, and if the sending state permits the payment of any expenses of biological parents that are not permitted under this Section, then the payment of those expenses shall not be a violation of this Section.

permitted to pay the reasonable attorney's fees of a biological parent's attorney in connection with proceedings under this Section or in connection with proceedings for the adoption of the child if the amount of fees of the attorney is $1,000 or less. If the amount of attorney's fees of each biological parent exceeds $1,000, the attorney's fees shall be paid only after a petition seeking leave to pay those fees is filed with the court in which the adoption proceeding is filed or to be filed. The court shall review the petition for leave to pay attorney's fees, and if the court determines that the fees requested are reasonable, the court shall permit the petitioners to pay them. If the court determines that the fees requested are not reasonable, the court shall determine and set the reasonable attorney's fees of the biological parents' attorney which may be paid by the petitioners.

        (11) The provisions of this subsection (d) apply to a
    	
person who is a prospective adoptive parent. This subsection (d) does not apply to a licensed child welfare agency, as that term is defined in the Child Care Act of 1969, whose payments are governed by the Child Care Act of 1969 and the Department of Children and Family Services rules adopted thereunder.
    (e) Injunctive relief.

subsection is a prerequisite to the admissibility in evidence of any part of the contents of any wire, electronic or oral communication that has been intercepted as a result of this exception, but nothing in this subsection shall be deemed to prevent a court from otherwise excluding the evidence on any other ground recognized by State or federal law, nor shall anything in this subsection be deemed to prevent a court from independently reviewing the admissibility of the evidence for compliance with the Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution or with Article I, Section 6 of the Illinois Constitution.

    (d) Theft by lessee; permissive inference. The trier of fact may infer evidence that a person intends to deprive the owner permanently of the use or benefit of the property (1) if a lessee of the personal property of another fails to return it to the owner within 10 days after written demand from the owner for its return or (2) if a lessee of the personal property of another fails to return it to the owner within 24 hours after written demand from the owner for its return and the lessee had presented identification to the owner that contained a materially fictitious name, address, or telephone number. A notice in writing, given after the expiration of the leasing agreement, addressed and mailed, by registered mail, to the lessee at the address given by him and shown on the leasing agreement shall constitute proper demand.
    (e) Permissive inference; evidence of intent that a person obtains by deception control over property. The trier of fact may infer that a person "knowingly obtains by deception control over property of the owner" when he or she fails to return, within 45 days after written demand from the owner, the downpayment and any additional payments accepted under a promise, oral or in writing, to perform services for the owner for consideration of $3,000 or more, and the promisor knowingly without good cause failed to substantially perform pursuant to the agreement after taking a down payment of 10% or more of the agreed upon consideration. This provision shall not apply where the owner initiated the suspension of performance under the agreement, or where the promisor responds to the notice within the 45-day notice period. A notice in writing, addressed and mailed, by registered mail, to the promisor at the last known address of the promisor, shall constitute proper demand.
    (f) Offender's interest in the property.
        (1) It is no defense to a charge of theft of property
    	
that the offender has an interest therein, when the owner also has an interest to which the offender is not entitled.
        (2) Where the property involved is that of the
    	
offender's spouse, no prosecution for theft may be maintained unless the parties were not living together as man and wife and were living in separate abodes at the time of the alleged theft.

The trier of fact may infer evidence that the person is without good cause if the person signs the agreement with a name or address other than his or her own.
    (c) A person commits theft when he or she borrows from a library facility library material which has an aggregate value of $50 or more pursuant to an agreement with or procedure established by the library facility for the return of such library material, and knowingly without good cause fails to return the library material so borrowed in accordance with such agreement or procedure, and further knowingly without good cause fails to return such library material within 30 days after receiving written notice by certified mail from the library facility demanding the return of such library material.
    (d) Sentence.
    A person convicted of theft under subsection (a) is guilty of a Class A misdemeanor, except that the theft of library material where the aggregate value exceeds $300 is a Class 3 felony. A person convicted of theft under subsection (b) of this Section is guilty of a Class 4 felony. A person convicted of theft under subsection (c) is guilty of a petty offense for which the offender may be fined an amount not to exceed $500 and shall be ordered to reimburse the library for postage costs, attorney's fees, and actual replacement costs of the materials not returned, except that theft under subsection (c) where the aggregate value exceeds $300 is a Class 3 felony.

        (3) Types of damages recoverable. Damages awarded by
    	
a court under this Section shall be computed as either of the following:
            (A) Upon his or her election of such damages at
        	
any time before final judgment is entered, the complaining party may recover the actual damages suffered by him or her as a result of the violation and any profits of the violator that are attributable to the violation and are not taken into account in computing the actual damages; in determining the violator's profits, the complaining party shall be required to prove only the violator's gross revenue, and the violator shall be required to prove his or her deductible expenses and the elements of profit attributable to factors other than the violation; or
            (B) Upon election by the complaining party at any
        	
time before final judgment is entered, that party may recover in lieu of actual damages an award of statutory damages of not less than $250 and not more than $10,000 for each unlawful communication or access device involved in the action, with the amount of statutory damages to be determined by the court, as the court considers just. In any case, if the court finds that any of the violations were committed with the intent to obtain commercial advantage or private financial gain, the court in its discretion may increase the award of statutory damages by an amount of not more than $50,000 for each unlawful communication or access device involved in the action.
        (4) Separate violations. For purposes of all civil
    	
remedies established for violations, the prohibited activity established in this Section applies to each unlawful communication or access device and shall be deemed a separate violation.

SUBDIVISION 10. RETAIL THEFT
(Source: P.A. 97-597, eff. 1-1-12.)

    (720 ILCS 5/16-25)
    Sec. 16-25. Retail theft.
    (a) A person commits retail theft when he or she knowingly:
        (1) Takes possession of, carries away, transfers or
    	
causes to be carried away or transferred any merchandise displayed, held, stored or offered for sale in a retail mercantile establishment with the intention of retaining such merchandise or with the intention of depriving the merchant permanently of the possession, use or benefit of such merchandise without paying the full retail value of such merchandise; or
        (2) Alters, transfers, or removes any label, price
    	
tag, marking, indicia of value or any other markings which aid in determining value affixed to any merchandise displayed, held, stored or offered for sale in a retail mercantile establishment and attempts to purchase such merchandise at less than the full retail value with the intention of depriving the merchant of the full retail value of such merchandise; or
        (3) Transfers any merchandise displayed, held, stored
    	
or offered for sale in a retail mercantile establishment from the container in or on which such merchandise is displayed to any other container with the intention of depriving the merchant of the full retail value of such merchandise; or
        (4) Under-rings with the intention of depriving the
    	
merchant of the full retail value of the merchandise; or
        (5) Removes a shopping cart from the premises of a
    	
retail mercantile establishment without the consent of the merchant given at the time of such removal with the intention of depriving the merchant permanently of the possession, use or benefit of such cart; or
        (6) Represents to a merchant that he, she, or another
    	
is the lawful owner of property, knowing that such representation is false, and conveys or attempts to convey that property to a merchant who is the owner of the property in exchange for money, merchandise credit or other property of the merchant; or
        (7) Uses or possesses any theft detection shielding
    	
device or theft detection device remover with the intention of using such device to deprive the merchant permanently of the possession, use or benefit of any merchandise displayed, held, stored or offered for sale in a retail mercantile establishment without paying the full retail value of such merchandise; or
        (8) Obtains or exerts unauthorized control over
    	
property of the owner and thereby intends to deprive the owner permanently of the use or benefit of the property when a lessee of the personal property of another fails to return it to the owner, or if the lessee fails to pay the full retail value of such property to the lessor in satisfaction of any contractual provision requiring such, within 10 days after written demand from the owner for its return. A notice in writing, given after the expiration of the leasing agreement, by registered mail, to the lessee at the address given by the lessee and shown on the leasing agreement shall constitute proper demand.
    (b) Theft by emergency exit. A person commits theft by emergency exit when he or she commits a retail theft as defined in subdivisions (a)(1) through (a)(8) of this Section and to facilitate the theft he or she leaves the retail mercantile establishment by use of a designated emergency exit.
    (c) Permissive inference. If any person:
        (1) conceals upon his or her person or among his or
    	
her belongings unpurchased merchandise displayed, held, stored or offered for sale in a retail mercantile establishment; and
        (2) removes that merchandise beyond the last known
    	
station for receiving payments for that merchandise in that retail mercantile establishment,
then the trier of fact may infer that the person possessed, carried away or transferred such merchandise with the intention of retaining it or with the intention of depriving the merchant permanently of the possession, use or benefit of such merchandise without paying the full retail value of such merchandise.
    To "conceal" merchandise means that, although there may be some notice of its presence, that merchandise is not visible through ordinary observation.
    (d) Venue. Multiple thefts committed by the same person as part of a continuing course of conduct in different jurisdictions that have been aggregated in one jurisdiction may be prosecuted in any jurisdiction in which one or more of the thefts occurred.
    (e) For the purposes of this Section, "theft detection shielding device" means any laminated or coated bag or device designed and intended to shield merchandise from detection by an electronic or magnetic theft alarm sensor.
    (f) Sentence.
        (1) A violation of any of subdivisions (a)(1) through
    	
(a)(6) and (a)(8) of this Section, the full retail value of which does not exceed $300 for property other than motor fuel or $150 for motor fuel, is a Class A misdemeanor. A violation of subdivision (a)(7) of this Section is a Class A misdemeanor for a first offense and a Class 4 felony for a second or subsequent offense. Theft by emergency exit of property, the full retail value of which does not exceed $300, is a Class 4 felony.
        (2) A person who has been convicted of retail theft
    	
of property under any of subdivisions (a)(1) through (a)(6) and (a)(8) of this Section, the full retail value of which does not exceed $300 for property other than motor fuel or $150 for motor fuel, and who has been previously convicted of any type of theft, robbery, armed robbery, burglary, residential burglary, possession of burglary tools, home invasion, unlawful use of a credit card, or forgery is guilty of a Class 4 felony. A person who has been convicted of theft by emergency exit of property, the full retail value of which does not exceed $300, and who has been previously convicted of any type of theft, robbery, armed robbery, burglary, residential burglary, possession of burglary tools, home invasion, unlawful use of a credit card, or forgery is guilty of a Class 3 felony.
        (3) Any retail theft of property under any of
    	
subdivisions (a)(1) through (a)(6) and (a)(8) of this Section, the full retail value of which exceeds $300 for property other than motor fuel or $150 for motor fuel in a single transaction, or in separate transactions committed by the same person as part of a continuing course of conduct from one or more mercantile establishments over a period of one year, is a Class 3 felony. Theft by emergency exit of property, the full retail value of which exceeds $300 in a single transaction, or in separate transactions committed by the same person as part of a continuing course of conduct from one or more mercantile establishments over a period of one year, is a Class 2 felony. When a charge of retail theft of property or theft by emergency exit of property, the full value of which exceeds $300, is brought, the value of the property involved is an element of the offense to be resolved by the trier of fact as either exceeding or not exceeding $300.

    Sec. 16-26. Detention; affirmative defense.
    (a) Detention. Any merchant who has reasonable grounds to believe that a person has committed retail theft may detain the person, on or off the premises of a retail mercantile establishment, in a reasonable manner and for a reasonable length of time for all or any of the following purposes:
        (1) To request identification;
        (2) To verify such identification;
        (3) To make reasonable inquiry as to whether such
    	
person has in his possession unpurchased merchandise and to make reasonable investigation of the ownership of such merchandise;
        (4) To inform a peace officer of the detention of the
    	
person and surrender that person to the custody of a peace officer;
        (5) In the case of a minor, to immediately make a
    	
reasonable attempt to inform the parents, guardian or other private person interested in the welfare of that minor and, at the merchant's discretion, a peace officer, of this detention and to surrender custody of such minor to such person.
    A merchant may make a detention as permitted in this Section off the premises of a retail mercantile establishment only if such detention is pursuant to an immediate pursuit of such person.
    A merchant shall be deemed to have reasonable grounds to make a detention for the purposes of this Section if the merchant detains a person because such person has in his or her possession either a theft detection shielding device or a theft detection device remover.
    (b) Affirmative defense. A detention as permitted in this Section does not constitute an arrest or an unlawful restraint, as defined in Section 10-3 of this Code, nor shall it render the merchant liable to the person so detained.
    (c) For the purposes of this Section, "minor" means a person who is less than 19 years of age, is unemancipated, and resides with his or her parent or parents or legal guardian.

    (720 ILCS 5/16-27)
    Sec. 16-27. Civil liability.
    (a) A person who commits the offense of retail theft as defined in subdivision (a)(1), (a)(2), (a)(3), or (a)(8) of Section 16-25 shall be civilly liable to the merchant of the merchandise in an amount consisting of:
        (i) actual damages equal to the full retail value of
    	
the merchandise; plus
        (ii) an amount not less than $100 nor more than
    	
$1,000; plus
        (iii) attorney's fees and court costs.
    (b) If a minor commits the offense of retail theft, the parents or guardian of the minor shall be civilly liable as provided in this Section; however, a guardian appointed pursuant to the Juvenile Court Act of 1987 shall not be liable under this Section. Total recovery under this Section shall not exceed the maximum recovery permitted under Section 5 of the Parental Responsibility Law. For the purposes of this Section, "minor" means a person who is less than 19 years of age, is unemancipated, and resides with his or her parent or parents or legal guardian.
    (c) A conviction or a plea of guilty to the offense of retail theft is not a prerequisite to the bringing of a civil suit under this Section.
    (d) Judgments arising under this Section may be assigned.

    (720 ILCS 5/16-28)
    Sec. 16-28. Delivery container theft.
    (a) A person commits delivery container theft when he or she knowingly does any of the following:
        (1) Uses for any purpose, when not on the premises of
    	
the owner or an adjacent parking area, a delivery container of another person which is marked by a name or mark unless the use is authorized by the owner.
        (2) Sells, or offers for sale, a delivery container
    	
of another person which is marked by a name or mark unless the sale is authorized by the owner.
        (3) Defaces, obliterates, destroys, covers up or
    	
otherwise removes or conceals a name or mark on a delivery container of another person without the written consent of the owner.
        (4) Removes the delivery container of another person
    	
from the premises, parking area or any other area under the control of any processor, distributor or retail establishment, or from any delivery vehicle, without the consent of the owner of the delivery container. If a person possesses any marked or named delivery container without the consent of the owner and while not on the premises, parking area or other area under control of a processor, distributor or retail establishment doing business with the owner, the trier of fact may infer that the person removed the delivery container in violation of this paragraph.
    (b) Any common carrier or private carrier for hire, except those engaged in transporting bakery or dairy products to and from the places where they are produced, that receives or transports any delivery container marked with a name or mark without having in its possession a bill of lading or invoice for that delivery container commits the offense of delivery container theft.
    (c) Sentence. Delivery container theft is a Class B misdemeanor. An offender may be sentenced to pay a fine of $150 for the first offense and $500 for a second or subsequent offense.

        (1) He or she knowingly causes another, by deception
    	
or threat, to execute a document disposing of property or a document by which a pecuniary obligation is incurred.

The trier of fact may infer that the defendant knows that the check or other order will not be paid by the depository and that the defendant has acted with intent to defraud when the defendant fails to have sufficient funds or credit with the depository when the check or other order is issued or delivered, or when such check or other order is presented for payment and dishonored on each of 2 occasions at least 7 days apart. In this paragraph (B)(1), "property" includes rental property (real or personal).

A person shall be deemed to have been authorized to possess, transfer, negotiate, or present for payment such item if the person was otherwise entitled by law to withdraw or recover funds from the account in question and followed the requisite procedures under the law. If the account holder, upon discovery of the withdrawal or payment, claims that the withdrawal or payment was not authorized, the financial institution may require the account holder to submit an affidavit to that effect on a form satisfactory to the financial institution before the financial institution may be required to credit the account in an amount equal to the amount or amounts that were withdrawn or paid without authorization.

    Sec. 17-1b. State's Attorney's bad check diversion program.
    (a) In this Section:
    "Offender" means a person charged with, or for whom probable cause exists to charge the person with, deceptive practices.
    "Pretrial diversion" means the decision of a prosecutor to refer an offender to a diversion program on condition that the criminal charges against the offender will be dismissed after a specified period of time, or the case will not be charged, if the offender successfully completes the program.
    "Restitution" means all amounts payable to a victim of deceptive practices under the bad check diversion program created under this Section, including the amount of the check and any transaction fees payable to a victim as set forth in subsection (g) but does not include amounts recoverable under Section 3-806 of the Uniform Commercial Code and subsection (E) of Section 17-1 of this Code.
    (b) A State's Attorney may create within his or her office a bad check diversion program for offenders who agree to voluntarily participate in the program instead of undergoing prosecution. The program may be conducted by the State's Attorney or by a private entity under contract with the State's Attorney. If the State's Attorney contracts with a private entity to perform any services in operating the program, the entity shall operate under the supervision, direction, and control of the State's Attorney. Any private entity providing services under this Section is not a "collection agency" as that term is defined under the Collection Agency Act.
    (c) If an offender is referred to the State's Attorney, the State's Attorney may determine whether the offender is appropriate for acceptance in the program. The State's Attorney may consider, but shall not be limited to consideration of, the following factors:
        (1) the amount of the check that was drawn or passed;
        (2) prior referrals of the offender to the program;
        (3) whether other charges of deceptive practices are
    	
pending against the offender;
        (4) the evidence presented to the State's Attorney
    	
regarding the facts and circumstances of the incident;
        (5) the offender's criminal history; and
        (6) the reason the check was dishonored by the
    	
financial institution.
    (d) The bad check diversion program may require an offender to do one or more of the following:
        (i) pay for, at his or her own expense, and
    	
successfully complete an educational class held by the State's Attorney or a private entity under contract with the State's Attorney;
        (ii) make full restitution for the offense;
        (iii) pay a per-check administrative fee as set forth
    	
in this Section.
    (e) If an offender is diverted to the program, the State's Attorney shall agree in writing not to prosecute the offender upon the offender's successful completion of the program conditions. The State's Attorney's agreement to divert the offender shall specify the offenses that will not be prosecuted by identifying the checks involved in the transactions.
    (f) The State's Attorney, or private entity under contract with the State's Attorney, may collect a fee from an offender diverted to the State's Attorney's bad check diversion program. This fee may be deposited in a bank account maintained by the State's Attorney for the purpose of depositing fees and paying the expenses of the program or for use in the enforcement and prosecution of criminal laws. The State's Attorney may require that the fee be paid directly to a private entity that administers the program under a contract with the State's Attorney. The amount of the administrative fees collected by the State's Attorney under the program may not exceed $35 per check. The county board may, however, by ordinance, increase the fees allowed by this Section if the increase is justified by an acceptable cost study showing that the fees allowed by this Section are not sufficient to cover the cost of providing the service.
    (g)  (1) The private entity shall be required to maintain
    	
adequate general liability insurance of $1,000,000 per occurrence as well as adequate coverage for potential loss resulting from employee dishonesty. The State's Attorney may require a surety bond payable to the State's Attorney if in the State's Attorney's opinion it is determined that the private entity is not adequately insured or funded.
        (2)  (A) Each private entity that has a contract with
        	
the State's Attorney to conduct a bad check diversion program shall at all times maintain a separate bank account in which all moneys received from the offenders participating in the program shall be deposited, referred to as a "trust account", except that negotiable instruments received may be forwarded directly to a victim of the deceptive practice committed by the offender if that procedure is provided for by a writing executed by the victim. Moneys received shall be so deposited within 5 business days after posting to the private entity's books of account. There shall be sufficient funds in the trust account at all times to pay the victims the amount due them.
            (B) The trust account shall be established in a
        	
financial institution which is federally or State insured or otherwise secured as defined by rule. If the account is interest bearing, the private entity shall pay to the victim interest earned on funds on deposit after the 60th day.
            (C) Each private entity shall keep on file the
        	
name of the financial institution in which each trust account is maintained, the name of each trust account, and the names of the persons authorized to withdraw funds from each account. The private entity, within 30 days of the time of a change of depository or person authorized to make withdrawal, shall update its files to reflect that change. An examination and audit of a private entity's trust accounts may be made by the State's Attorney as the State's Attorney deems appropriate. A trust account financial report shall be submitted annually on forms acceptable to the State's Attorney.
        (3) The State's Attorney may cancel a contract
    	
entered into with a private entity under this Section for any one or any combination of the following causes:
            (A) Conviction of the private entity or the
        	
principals of the private entity of any crime under the laws of any U.S. jurisdiction which is a felony, a misdemeanor an essential element of which is dishonesty, or of any crime which directly relates to the practice of the profession.
            (B) A determination that the private entity has
        	
engaged in conduct prohibited in item (4).
        (4) The State's Attorney may determine whether the
    	
private entity has engaged in the following prohibited conduct:
            (A) Using or threatening to use force or violence
        	
to cause physical harm to an offender, his or her family, or his or her property.
            (B) Threatening the seizure, attachment, or sale
        	
of an offender's property where such action can only be taken pursuant to court order without disclosing that prior court proceedings are required.
            (C) Disclosing or threatening to disclose
        	
information adversely affecting an offender's reputation for creditworthiness with knowledge the information is false.
            (D) Initiating or threatening to initiate
        	
communication with an offender's employer unless there has been a default of the payment of the obligation for at least 30 days and at least 5 days prior written notice, to the last known address of the offender, of the intention to communicate with the employer has been given to the employee, except as expressly permitted by law or court order.
            (E) Communicating with the offender or any member
        	
of the offender's family at such a time of day or night and with such frequency as to constitute harassment of the offender or any member of the offender's family. For purposes of this clause (E) the following conduct shall constitute harassment:
                (i) Communicating with the offender or any
            	
member of his or her family at any unusual time or place or a time or place known or which should be known to be inconvenient to the offender. In the absence of knowledge of circumstances to the contrary, a private entity shall assume that the convenient time for communicating with a consumer is after 8 o'clock a.m. and before 9 o'clock p.m. local time at the offender's residence.
                (ii) The threat of publication or publication
            	
of a list of offenders who allegedly refuse to pay restitution, except by the State's Attorney.
                (iii) The threat of advertisement or
            	
advertisement for sale of any restitution to coerce payment of the restitution.
                (iv) Causing a telephone to ring or engaging
            	
any person in telephone conversation repeatedly or continuously with intent to annoy, abuse, or harass any person at the called number.

    Sec. 21.1-1. Legislative finding and declaration.
    The Legislature finds and declares that men in a free society have the right to quiet enjoyment of their homes; that the stability of community and family life cannot be maintained unless the right to privacy and a sense of security and peace in the home are respected and encouraged; that residential picketing, however just the cause inspiring it, disrupts home, family and communal life; that residential picketing is inappropriate in our society, where the jealously guarded rights of free speech and assembly have always been associated with respect for the rights of others. For these reasons the Legislature finds and declares this Article to be necessary.

        "With the principal objective of livelihood and
    	
profit" means that the intent underlying the sale or disposition of firearms is predominantly one of obtaining livelihood and pecuniary gain, as opposed to other intents, such as improving or liquidating a personal firearms collection; however, proof of profit shall not be required as to a person who engages in the regular and repetitive purchase and disposition of firearms for criminal purposes or terrorism.

        (l) Not being entitled to the possession of a
    	
firearm, delivers the firearm, knowing it to have been stolen or converted. It may be inferred that a person who possesses a firearm with knowledge that its serial number has been removed or altered has knowledge that the firearm is stolen or converted.

As used in this Section, a "gambling device" includes any slot machine, and includes any machine or device constructed for the reception of money or other thing of value and so constructed as to return, or to cause someone to return, on chance to the player thereof money, property or a right to receive money or property.

    Sec. 29B-4. Protective orders and warrants for forfeiture purposes.
    (a) Upon application of the State, the court may enter a restraining order or injunction, require the execution of a satisfactory performance bond, or take any other action to preserve the availability of property described in Section 29B-5 of this Article for forfeiture under this Article:
        (1) upon the filing of an indictment, information, or
    	
complaint charging a violation of this Article for which forfeiture may be ordered under this Article and alleging that the property with respect to which the order is sought would be subject to forfeiture under this Article; or
        (2) prior to the filing of the indictment,
    	
information, or complaint, if, after notice to persons appearing to have an interest in the property and opportunity for a hearing, the court determines that:
            (A) there is probable cause to believe that the
        	
State will prevail on the issue of forfeiture and that failure to enter the order will result in the property being destroyed, removed from the jurisdiction of the court, or otherwise made unavailable for forfeiture; and
            (B) the need to preserve the availability of the
        	
property through the entry of the requested order outweighs the hardship on any party against whom the order is to be entered.
        Provided, however, that an order entered under
    	
paragraph (2) of this Section shall be effective for not more than 90 days, unless extended by the court for good cause shown or unless an indictment, information, complaint, or administrative notice has been filed.
    (b) A temporary restraining order under this subsection (b) may be entered upon application of the State without notice or opportunity for a hearing when an indictment, information, complaint, or administrative notice has not yet been filed with respect to the property, if the State demonstrates that there is probable cause to believe that the property with respect to which the order is sought would be subject to forfeiture under this Article and that provision of notice will jeopardize the availability of the property for forfeiture. The temporary order shall expire not more than 30 days after the date on which it is entered, unless extended for good cause shown or unless the party against whom it is entered consents to an extension for a longer period. A hearing requested concerning an order entered under this subsection (b) shall be held at the earliest possible time and prior to the expiration of the temporary order.
    (c) The court may receive and consider, at a hearing held under this Section, evidence and information that would be inadmissible under the Illinois rules of evidence.
    (d) Under its authority to enter a pretrial restraining order under this Section, the court may order a defendant to repatriate any property that may be seized and forfeited and to deposit that property pending trial with the Department of State Police or another law enforcement agency designated by the Department of State Police. Failure to comply with an order under this Section is punishable as a civil or criminal contempt of court.
    (e) The State may request the issuance of a warrant authorizing the seizure of property described in Section 29B-5 of this Article in the same manner as provided for a search warrant. If the court determines that there is probable cause to believe that the property to be seized would be subject to forfeiture, the court shall issue a warrant authorizing the seizure of that property.

        (1) if the seizure is incident to a seizure warrant;
        (2) if the property subject to seizure has been the
    	
subject of a prior judgment in favor of the State in a criminal proceeding, or in an injunction or forfeiture proceeding based upon this Article;
        (3) if there is probable cause to believe that the
    	
property is directly or indirectly dangerous to health or safety;
        (4) if there is probable cause to believe that the
    	
property is subject to forfeiture under this Article and the property is seized under circumstances in which a warrantless seizure or arrest would be reasonable; or
        (5) in accordance with the Code of Criminal Procedure

    Sec. 29B-10. Notice to owner or interest holder.
    (a) The first attempted service of notice shall be commenced within 28 days of the latter of filing of the verified claim or the receipt of the notice from the seizing agency by Form 4-64. A complaint for forfeiture or a notice of pending forfeiture shall be served on a claimant if the owner's or interest holder's name and current address are known, then by either: (1) personal service; or (2) mailing a copy of the notice by certified mail, return receipt requested, and first class mail to that address.
    (b) If no signed return receipt is received by the State's Attorney within 28 days of mailing or no communication from the owner or interest holder is received by the State's Attorney documenting actual notice by the parties, the State's Attorney shall, within a reasonable period of time, mail a second copy of the notice by certified mail, return receipt requested, and first class mail to that address. If no signed return receipt is received by the State's Attorney within 28 days of the second mailing, or no communication from the owner or interest holder is received by the State's Attorney documenting actual notice by the parties, the State's Attorney shall have 60 days to attempt to serve the notice by personal service, including substitute service by leaving a copy at the usual place of abode with some person of the family or a person residing there, of the age of 13 years or upwards. If, after 3 attempts at service in this manner, no service of the notice is accomplished, the notice shall be posted in a conspicuous manner at the address and service shall be made by the posting. The attempts at service and the posting, if required, shall be documented by the person attempting service which shall be made part of a return of service returned to the State's Attorney. The State's Attorney may utilize any Sheriff or Deputy Sheriff, a peace officer, a private process server or investigator, or an employee, agent, or investigator of the State's Attorney's Office to attempt service without seeking leave of court.
    (c) After the procedures listed are followed, service shall be effective on the owner or interest holder on the date of receipt by the State's Attorney of a return receipt, or on the date of receipt of a communication from an owner or interest holder documenting actual notice, whichever is first in time, or on the date of the last act performed by the State's Attorney in attempting personal service. For purposes of notice under this Section, if a person has been arrested for the conduct giving rise to the forfeiture, the address provided to the arresting agency at the time of arrest shall be deemed to be that person's known address. Provided, however, if an owner or interest holder's address changes prior to the effective date of the notice of pending forfeiture, the owner or interest holder shall promptly notify the seizing agency of the change in address or, if the owner or interest holder's address changes subsequent to the effective date of the notice of pending forfeiture, the owner or interest holder shall promptly notify the State's Attorney of the change in address. If the property seized is a conveyance, notice shall also be directed to the address reflected in the office of the agency or official in which title to or interest in the conveyance is required by law to be recorded.
    (d) If the owner's or interest holder's address is not known, and is not on record as provided in this Section, service by publication for 3 successive weeks in a newspaper of general circulation in the county in which the seizure occurred shall suffice for service requirements.
    (e) Notice to any business entity, corporation, limited liability company, limited liability partnership, or partnership shall be completed by a single mailing of a copy of the notice by certified mail, return receipt requested, and first class mail to that address. This notice is complete regardless of the return of a signed return receipt.
    (f) Notice to a person whose address is not within the State shall be completed by a single mailing of a copy of the notice by certified mail, return receipt requested, and first class mail to that address. This notice is complete regardless of the return of a signed return receipt.
    (g) Notice to a person whose address is not within the United States shall be completed by a single mailing of a copy of the notice by certified mail, return receipt requested, and first class mail to that address. This notice is complete regardless of the return of a signed return receipt. If certified mail is not available in the foreign country where the person has an address, notice shall proceed by publication requirements under subsection (d) of this Section.
    (h) Notice to a person whom the State's Attorney reasonably should know is incarcerated within this State shall also include mailing a copy of the notice by certified mail, return receipt requested, and first class mail to the address of the detention facility with the inmate's name clearly marked on the envelope.
    (i) After a claimant files a verified claim with the State's Attorney and provides an address at which the claimant will accept service, the complaint shall be served and notice shall be complete upon the mailing of the complaint to the claimant at the address the claimant provided via certified mail, return receipt requested, and first class mail. No return receipt need be received, or any other attempts at service need be made to comply with service and notice requirements under this Section. This certified mailing, return receipt requested, shall be proof of service of the complaint on the claimant. If notice is to be shown by actual notice from communication with a claimant, then the State's Attorney shall file an affidavit as proof of service, providing details of the communication, which shall be accepted as proof of service by the court.
    (j) If the property seized is a conveyance, notice shall also be directed to the address reflected in the office of the agency or official in which title to or interest in the conveyance is required by law to be recorded by mailing a copy of the notice by certified mail, return receipt requested, to that address.
    (k) Notice served under this Article is effective upon personal service, the last date of publication, or the mailing of written notice, whichever is earlier.

        "This is a civil court proceeding subject to the Code
    	
of Civil Procedure. You received this Complaint of Forfeiture because the State's Attorney's office has brought a legal action seeking forfeiture of your seized property. This complaint starts the court process where the State seeks to prove that your property should be forfeited and not returned to you. This process is also your opportunity to try to prove to a judge that you should get your property back. The complaint lists the date, time, and location of your first court date. You must appear in court on that day, or you may lose the case automatically. You must also file an appearance and answer. If you are unable to pay the appearance fee, you may qualify to have the fee waived. If there is a criminal case related to the seizure of your property, your case may be set for trial after the criminal case has been resolved. Before trial, the judge may allow discovery, where the State can ask you to respond in writing to questions and give them certain documents, and you can make similar requests of the State. The trial is your opportunity to explain what happened when your property was seized and why you should get the property back."
        (4) Forfeiture proceedings under this Article shall
    	
be subject to the Code of Civil Procedure and the rules of evidence relating to civil actions shall apply to proceedings under this Article with the following exception.

        (5) Only an owner of or interest holder in the
    	
property may file an answer asserting a claim against the property in the action in rem. For purposes of this Section, the owner or interest holder shall be referred to as claimant. Upon motion of the State, the court shall first hold a hearing, in which a claimant shall establish by a preponderance of the evidence, that he or she has a lawful, legitimate ownership interest in the property and that it was obtained through a lawful source.
        (6) The answer must be signed by the owner or
    	
interest holder under penalty of perjury and shall set forth:

45 days after service of the civil in rem complaint.
        (8) The hearing shall be held within 60 days after
    	
filing of the answer unless continued for good cause.
        (9) At the judicial in rem proceeding, in the State's
    	
case in chief, the State shall show by a preponderance of the evidence that the property is subject to forfeiture. If the State makes such a showing, the claimant shall have the burden of production to set forth evidence that the property is not related to the alleged factual basis of the forfeiture. After this production of evidence, the State shall maintain the burden of proof to overcome this assertion. A claimant shall provide the State notice of its intent to allege that the currency or its equivalent is not related to the alleged factual basis of the forfeiture and why. As to conveyances, at the judicial in rem proceeding, in its case in chief, the State shall show by a preponderance of the evidence:
            (A) that the property is subject to forfeiture;
        	
and
            (B) at least one of the following:
                (i) that the claimant was legally accountable
            	
for the conduct giving rise to the forfeiture;
                (ii) that the claimant knew or reasonably
            	
should have known of the conduct giving rise to the forfeiture;
                (iii) that the claimant knew or reasonably
            	
should have known that the conduct giving rise to the forfeiture was likely to occur;
                (iv) that the claimant held the property for
            	
the benefit of, or as nominee for, any person whose conduct gave rise to its forfeiture;
                (v) that if the claimant acquired the
            	
interest through any person engaging in any of the conduct described above or conduct giving rise to the forfeiture:
                    (a) the claimant did not acquire it as a
                	
bona fide purchaser for value; or
                    (b) the claimant acquired the interest
                	
under the circumstances that the claimant reasonably should have known the property was derived from, or used in, the conduct giving rise to the forfeiture; or
                (vi) that the claimant is not the true owner
            	
of the property that is subject to forfeiture.
        (10) If the State does not meet its burden to show
    	
that the property is subject to forfeiture, the court shall order the interest in the property returned or conveyed to the claimant and shall order all other property forfeited to the State. If the State does meet its burden to show that the property is subject to forfeiture, the court shall order all property forfeited to the State.
        (11) A defendant convicted in any criminal proceeding
    	
is precluded from later denying the essential allegations of the criminal offense of which the defendant was convicted in any proceeding under this Article regardless of the pendency of an appeal from that conviction. However, evidence of the pendency of an appeal is admissible.
        (12) On a motion by the parties, the court may stay
    	
civil forfeiture proceedings during the criminal trial for a related criminal indictment or information alleging a money laundering violation. Such a stay shall not be available pending an appeal. Property subject to forfeiture under this Article shall not be subject to return or release by a court exercising jurisdiction over a criminal case involving the seizure of the property unless the return or release is consented to by the State's Attorney.

    Sec. 29B-14. Innocent owner hearing.
    (a) After a complaint for forfeiture has been filed and all claimants have appeared and answered, a claimant may file a motion with the court for an innocent owner hearing prior to trial. This motion shall be made and supported by sworn affidavit and shall assert the following along with specific facts that support each assertion:
        (1) that the claimant filing the motion is the true
    	
owner of the conveyance as interpreted by case law;
        (2) that the claimant was not legally accountable for
    	
the conduct giving rise to the forfeiture or acquiesced in the conduct;
        (3) that the claimant did not solicit, conspire, or
    	
attempt to commit the conduct giving rise to the forfeiture;
        (4) that the claimant did not know or did not have
    	
reason to know that the conduct giving rise to the forfeiture was likely to occur; and
        (5) that the claimant did not hold the property for
    	
the benefit of, or as nominee for, any person whose conduct gave rise to its forfeiture, or if the claimant acquired the interest through any person, the claimant acquired it as a bona fide purchaser for value or acquired the interest without knowledge of the seizure of the property for forfeiture.
    (b) The claimant's motion shall include specific facts supporting these assertions.
    (c) Upon this filing, a hearing may only be conducted after the parties have been given the opportunity to conduct limited discovery as to the ownership and control of the property, the claimant's knowledge, or any matter relevant to the issues raised or facts alleged in the claimant's motion. Discovery shall be limited to the People's requests in these areas but may proceed by any means allowed in the Code of Civil Procedure.
        (1) After discovery is complete and the court has
    	
allowed for sufficient time to review and investigate the discovery responses, the court shall conduct a hearing. At the hearing, the fact that the conveyance is subject to forfeiture shall not be at issue. The court shall only hear evidence relating to the issue of innocent ownership.
        (2) At the hearing on the motion, it shall be the
    	
burden of the claimant to prove each of the assertions listed in subsection (a) of this Section by a preponderance of the evidence.
        (3) If a claimant meets his or her burden of proof,
    	
the court shall grant the motion and order the property returned to the claimant. If the claimant fails to meet his or her burden of proof, then the court shall deny the motion and the forfeiture case shall proceed according to the Code of Civil Procedure.

        (2) the State receives an adverse finding at a
    	
preliminary hearing and fails to secure an indictment in a criminal proceeding relating to the factual allegations of the forfeiture action.
    (b) All property declared forfeited under this Article vests in the State on the commission of the conduct giving rise to forfeiture together with the proceeds of the property after that time. Except as otherwise provided in this Article, title to any property or proceeds subject to forfeiture subsequently transferred to any person remain subject to forfeiture and thereafter shall be ordered forfeited unless the person to whom the property was transferred makes an appropriate claim and has his or her claim adjudicated at the judicial in rem hearing.
    (c) A civil action under this Article shall be commenced within 5 years after the last conduct giving rise to forfeiture became known or should have become known or 5 years after the forfeitable property is discovered, whichever is later, excluding any time during which either the property or claimant is out of the State or in confinement or during which criminal proceedings relating to the same conduct are in progress.

    (b) The law enforcement agency that holds custody of property is responsible for any damages, storage fees, and related costs applicable to property returned. The claimant shall not be subject to any charges by the State for storage of the property or expenses incurred in the preservation of the property.

    (d) A claimant or a party interested in personal property contained within a seized conveyance may file a request with the State's Attorney in a non-judicial forfeiture action, or a motion with the court in a judicial forfeiture action for the return of any personal property contained within a conveyance that is seized under this Article.

    Sec. 29D-5. Legislative findings. The devastating consequences of the barbaric attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon on September 11, 2001 underscore the compelling need for legislation that is specifically designed to combat the evils of terrorism. Terrorism is inconsistent with civilized society and cannot be tolerated.
    A comprehensive State law is urgently needed to complement federal laws in the fight against terrorism and to better protect all citizens against terrorist acts. Accordingly, the legislature finds that our laws must be strengthened to ensure that terrorists, as well as those who solicit or provide financial and other support to terrorists, are prosecuted and punished in State courts with appropriate severity. The legislature further finds that due to the grave nature and global reach of terrorism that a comprehensive law encompassing State criminal statutes and strong civil remedies is needed.
    An investigation may not be initiated or continued for activities protected by the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, including expressions of support or the provision of financial support for the nonviolent political, religious, philosophical, or ideological goals or beliefs of any person or group.

ARTICLE 33A. ARMED VIOLENCE

    (720 ILCS 5/33A-1) (from Ch. 38, par. 33A-1)
    Sec. 33A-1. Legislative intent and definitions.
    (a) Legislative findings. The legislature finds and declares the following:
        (1) The use of a dangerous weapon in the commission
    	
of a felony offense poses a much greater threat to the public health, safety, and general welfare, than when a weapon is not used in the commission of the offense.
        (2) Further, the use of a firearm greatly facilitates
    	
the commission of a criminal offense because of the more lethal nature of a firearm and the greater perceived threat produced in those confronted by a person wielding a firearm. Unlike other dangerous weapons such as knives and clubs, the use of a firearm in the commission of a criminal felony offense significantly escalates the threat and the potential for bodily harm, and the greater range of the firearm increases the potential for harm to more persons. Not only are the victims and bystanders at greater risk when a firearm is used, but also the law enforcement officers whose duty is to confront and apprehend the armed suspect.
        (3) Current law does contain offenses involving the
    	
use or discharge of a gun toward or against a person, such as aggravated battery with a firearm, aggravated discharge of a firearm, and reckless discharge of a firearm; however, the General Assembly has legislated greater penalties for the commission of a felony while in possession of a firearm because it deems such acts as more serious.
    (b) Legislative intent.
        (1) In order to deter the use of firearms in the
    	
commission of a felony offense, the General Assembly deems it appropriate for a greater penalty to be imposed when a firearm is used or discharged in the commission of an offense than the penalty imposed for using other types of weapons and for the penalty to increase on more serious offenses.
        (2) With the additional elements of the discharge of
    	
a firearm and great bodily harm inflicted by a firearm being added to armed violence and other serious felony offenses, it is the intent of the General Assembly to punish those elements more severely during commission of a felony offense than when those elements stand alone as the act of the offender.
        (3) It is the intent of the 91st General Assembly
    	
that should Public Act 88-680 be declared unconstitutional for a violation of Article 4, Section 8 of the 1970 Constitution of the State of Illinois, the amendatory changes made by Public Act 88-680 to Article 33A of the Criminal Code of 1961 and which are set forth as law in this amendatory Act of the 91st General Assembly are hereby reenacted by this amendatory Act of the 91st General Assembly.
    (c) Definitions.
        (1) "Armed with a dangerous weapon". A person is
    	
considered armed with a dangerous weapon for purposes of this Article, when he or she carries on or about his or her person or is otherwise armed with a Category I, Category II, or Category III weapon.
        (2) A Category I weapon is a handgun, sawed-off
    	
shotgun, sawed-off rifle, any other firearm small enough to be concealed upon the person, semiautomatic firearm, or machine gun. A Category II weapon is any other rifle, shotgun, spring gun, other firearm, stun gun or taser as defined in paragraph (a) of Section 24-1 of this Code, knife with a blade of at least 3 inches in length, dagger, dirk, switchblade knife, stiletto, axe, hatchet, or other deadly or dangerous weapon or instrument of like character. As used in this subsection (b) "semiautomatic firearm" means a repeating firearm that utilizes a portion of the energy of a firing cartridge to extract the fired cartridge case and chamber the next round and that requires a separate pull of the trigger to fire each cartridge.
        (3) A Category III weapon is a bludgeon, black-jack,
    	
slungshot, sand-bag, sand-club, metal knuckles, billy, or other dangerous weapon of like character.

    (Section scheduled to be repealed on June 11, 2022)
    Sec. 33G-4. Prohibited activities.
    (a) It is unlawful for any person, who intentionally participates in the operation or management of an enterprise, directly or indirectly, to:
        (1) knowingly do so, directly or indirectly, through
    	
a pattern of predicate activity;
        (2) knowingly cause another to violate this Article;
    	
or
        (3) knowingly conspire to violate this Article.
    Notwithstanding any other provision of law, in any prosecution for a conspiracy to violate this Article, no person may be convicted of that conspiracy unless an overt act in furtherance of the agreement is alleged and proved to have been committed by him, her, or by a coconspirator, but the commission of the overt act need not itself constitute predicate activity underlying the specific violation of this Article.
    (b) It is unlawful for any person knowingly to acquire or maintain, directly or indirectly, through a pattern of predicate activity any interest in, or control of, to any degree, any enterprise, real property, or personal property of any character, including money.
    (c) Nothing in this Article shall be construed as to make unlawful any activity which is arguably protected or prohibited by the National Labor Relations Act, the Illinois Educational Labor Relations Act, the Illinois Public Labor Relations Act, or the Railway Labor Act.
    (d) The following organizations, and any officer or agent of those organizations acting in his or her official capacity as an officer or agent, may not be sued in civil actions under this Article:
        (1) a labor organization; or
        (2) any business defined in Division D, E, F, G, H,
    	
or I of the Standard Industrial Classification as established by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, U.S. Department of Labor.
    (e) Any person prosecuted under this Article may be convicted and sentenced either:
        (1) for the offense of conspiring to violate this
    	
Article, and for any other particular offense or offenses that may be one of the objects of a conspiracy to violate this Article; or
        (2) for the offense of violating this Article, and
    	
for any other particular offense or offenses that may constitute predicate activity underlying a violation of this Article.
    (f) The State's Attorney, or a person designated by law to act for him or her and to perform his or her duties during his or her absence or disability, may authorize a criminal prosecution under this Article. Prior to any State's Attorney authorizing a criminal prosecution under this Article, the State's Attorney shall adopt rules and procedures governing the investigation and prosecution of any offense enumerated in this Article. These rules and procedures shall set forth guidelines which require that any potential prosecution under this Article be subject to an internal approval process in which it is determined, in a written prosecution memorandum prepared by the State's Attorney's Office, that (1) a prosecution under this Article is necessary to ensure that the indictment adequately reflects the nature and extent of the criminal conduct involved in a way that prosecution only on the underlying predicate activity would not, and (2) a prosecution under this Article would provide the basis for an appropriate sentence under all the circumstances of the case in a way that a prosecution only on the underlying predicate activity would not. No State's Attorney, or person designated by law to act for him or her and to perform his or her duties during his or her absence or disability, may authorize a criminal prosecution under this Article prior to reviewing the prepared written prosecution memorandum. However, any internal memorandum shall remain protected from disclosure under the attorney-client privilege, and this provision does not create any enforceable right on behalf of any defendant or party, nor does it subject the exercise of prosecutorial discretion to judicial review.
    (g) A labor organization and any officer or agent of that organization acting in his or her capacity as an officer or agent of the labor organization are exempt from prosecution under this Article.

    Sec. 36-1.4. Notice to State's Attorney. The law enforcement agency seizing property for forfeiture under this Article shall, as soon as practicable but not later than 28 days after the seizure, notify the State's Attorney for the county in which an act or omission giving rise to the seizure occurred or in which the property was seized and the facts and circumstances giving rise to the seizure and shall provide the State's Attorney with the inventory of the property and its estimated value. The notice shall be by the delivery of Illinois State Police Notice/Inventory of Seized Property (Form 4-64). If the property seized for forfeiture is a vehicle, the law enforcement agency seizing the property shall immediately notify the Secretary of State that forfeiture proceedings are pending regarding the vehicle.

    (720 ILCS 5/36-1.5)
    Sec. 36-1.5. Preliminary review.
    (a) Within 14 days of the seizure, the State's Attorney of the county in which the seizure occurred shall seek a preliminary determination from the circuit court as to whether there is probable cause that the property may be subject to forfeiture.
    (b) The rules of evidence shall not apply to any proceeding conducted under this Section.
    (c) The court may conduct the review under subsection (a) of this Section simultaneously with a proceeding under Section 109-1 of the Code of Criminal Procedure of 1963 for a related criminal offense if a prosecution is commenced by information or complaint.
    (d) The court may accept a finding of probable cause at a preliminary hearing following the filing of an information or complaint charging a related criminal offense or following the return of indictment by a grand jury charging the related offense as sufficient evidence of probable cause as required under subsection (a) of this Section.
    (e) Upon making a finding of probable cause as required under this Section, the circuit court shall order the property subject to the provisions of the applicable forfeiture Act held until the conclusion of any forfeiture proceeding.
    For seizures of conveyances, within 28 days of a finding of probable cause under subsection (a) of this Section, the registered owner or other claimant may file a motion in writing supported by sworn affidavits claiming that denial of the use of the conveyance during the pendency of the forfeiture proceedings creates a substantial hardship and alleges facts showing that the hardship was not due to his or her culpable negligence. The court shall consider the following factors in determining whether a substantial hardship has been proven:
        (1) the nature of the claimed hardship;
        (2) the availability of public transportation or
    	
other available means of transportation; and
        (3) any available alternatives to alleviate the
    	
hardship other than the return of the seized conveyance.
    If the court determines that a substantial hardship has been proven, the court shall then balance the nature of the hardship against the State's interest in safeguarding the conveyance. If the court determines that the hardship outweighs the State's interest in safeguarding the conveyance, the court may temporarily release the conveyance to the registered owner or the registered owner's authorized designee, or both, until the conclusion of the forfeiture proceedings or for such shorter period as ordered by the court provided that the person to whom the conveyance is released provides proof of insurance and a valid driver's license and all State and local registrations for operation of the conveyance are current. The court shall place conditions on the conveyance limiting its use to the stated hardship and providing transportation for employment, religious purposes, medical needs, child care, and restricting the conveyance's use to only those individuals authorized to use the conveyance by the registered owner. The use of the vehicle shall be further restricted to exclude all recreational and entertainment purposes. The court may order additional restrictions it deems reasonable and just on its own motion or on motion of the People. The court shall revoke the order releasing the conveyance and order that the conveyance be reseized by law enforcement if the conditions of release are violated or if the conveyance is used in the commission of any offense identified in subsection (a) of Section 6-205 of the Illinois Vehicle Code.
    If the court orders the release of the conveyance during the pendency of the forfeiture proceedings, the court may order the registered owner or his or her authorized designee to post a cash security with the clerk of the court as ordered by the court. If cash security is ordered, the court shall consider the following factors in determining the amount of the cash security:
        (A) the full market value of the conveyance;
        (B) the nature of the hardship;
        (C) the extent and length of the usage of the
    	
conveyance;
        (D) the ability of the owner or designee to pay; and
        (E) other conditions as the court deems necessary to
    	
safeguard the conveyance.
    If the conveyance is released, the court shall order that the registered owner or his or her designee safeguard the conveyance, not remove the conveyance from the jurisdiction, not conceal, destroy, or otherwise dispose of the conveyance, not encumber the conveyance, and not diminish the value of the conveyance in any way. The court shall also make a determination of the full market value of the conveyance prior to it being released based on a source or sources defined in 50 Ill. Adm. Code 919.80(c)(2)(A) or 919.80(c)(2)(B).
    If the conveyance subject to forfeiture is released under this Section and is subsequently forfeited, the person to whom the conveyance was released shall return the conveyance to the law enforcement agency that seized the conveyance within 7 days from the date of the declaration of forfeiture or order of forfeiture. If the conveyance is not returned within 7 days, the cash security shall be forfeited in the same manner as the conveyance subject to forfeiture. If the cash security was less than the full market value, a judgment shall be entered against the parties to whom the conveyance was released and the registered owner, jointly and severally, for the difference between the full market value and the amount of the cash security. If the conveyance is returned in a condition other than the condition in which it was released, the cash security shall be returned to the surety who posted the security minus the amount of the diminished value, and that amount shall be forfeited in the same manner as the conveyance subject to forfeiture. Additionally, the court may enter an order allowing any law enforcement agency in the State of Illinois to seize the conveyance wherever it may be found in the State to satisfy the judgment if the cash security was less than the full market value of the conveyance.

    Sec. 36-2. Complaint for forfeiture.
    (a) If the State's Attorney of the county in which such seizure occurs finds that the alleged violation of law giving rise to the seizure was incurred without willful negligence or without any intention on the part of the owner of the vessel or watercraft, vehicle, or aircraft or any person whose right, title, or interest is of record as described in Section 36-1 of this Article, to violate the law, or finds the existence of such mitigating circumstances as to justify remission of the forfeiture, he or she may cause the law enforcement agency having custody of the property to return the property to the owner within a reasonable time not to exceed 7 days. The State's Attorney shall exercise his or her discretion under this subsection (a) prior to or promptly after the preliminary review under Section 36-1.5.
    (b) If, after review of the facts surrounding the seizure, the State's Attorney is of the opinion that the seized property is subject to forfeiture and the State's Attorney does not cause the forfeiture to be remitted under subsection (a) of this Section, he or she shall bring an action for forfeiture in the circuit court within whose jurisdiction the seizure and confiscation has taken place by filing a verified complaint for forfeiture in the circuit court within whose jurisdiction the seizure occurred, or within whose jurisdiction an act or omission giving rise to the seizure occurred, subject to Supreme Court Rule 187. The complaint shall be filed as soon as practicable but not later than 28 days after the State's Attorney receives notice from the seizing agency as provided under Section 36-1.4 of this Article. A complaint of forfeiture shall include:
        (1) a description of the property seized;
        (2) the date and place of seizure of the property;
        (3) the name and address of the law enforcement
    	
agency making the seizure; and
        (4) the specific statutory and factual grounds for
    	
the seizure.
    The complaint shall be served upon each person whose right, title, or interest is of record in the office of the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Transportation, the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Agency, or any other department of this State, or any other state of the United States if the vessel or watercraft, vehicle, or aircraft is required to be so registered, as the case may be, the person from whom the property was seized, and all persons known or reasonably believed by the State to claim an interest in the property, as provided in this Article. The complaint shall be accompanied by the following written notice:
    "This is a civil court proceeding subject to the Code of Civil Procedure. You received this Complaint of Forfeiture because the State's Attorney's office has brought a legal action seeking forfeiture of your seized property. This complaint starts the court process where the State seeks to prove that your property should be forfeited and not returned to you. This process is also your opportunity to try to prove to a judge that you should get your property back. The complaint lists the date, time, and location of your first court date. You must appear in court on that day, or you may lose the case automatically. You must also file an appearance and answer. If you are unable to pay the appearance fee, you may qualify to have the fee waived. If there is a criminal case related to the seizure of your property, your case may be set for trial after the criminal case has been resolved. Before trial, the judge may allow discovery, where the State can ask you to respond in writing to questions and give them certain documents, and you can make similar requests of the State. The trial is your opportunity to explain what happened when your property was seized and why you should get the property back."

    (720 ILCS 5/36-2.1)
    Sec. 36-2.1. Notice to owner or interest holder. The first attempted service of notice shall be commenced within 28 days of the receipt of the notice from the seizing agency by Form 4-64. If the property seized is a conveyance, notice shall also be directed to the address reflected in the office of the agency or official in which title to or interest in the conveyance is required by law to be recorded. A complaint for forfeiture shall be served upon the property owner or interest holder in the following manner:
        (1) If the owner's or interest holder's name and
    	
current address are known, then by either:
            (A) personal service; or
            (B) mailing a copy of the notice by certified
        	
mail, return receipt requested, and first class mail to that address.
                (i) If notice is sent by certified mail and
            	
no signed return receipt is received by the State's Attorney within 28 days of mailing, and no communication from the owner or interest holder is received by the State's Attorney documenting actual notice by said parties, the State's Attorney shall, within a reasonable period of time, mail a second copy of the notice by certified mail, return receipt requested, and first class mail to that address.
                (ii) If no signed return receipt is received
            	
by the State's Attorney within 28 days of the second attempt at service by certified mail, and no communication from the owner or interest holder is received by the State's Attorney documenting actual notice by said parties, the State's Attorney shall have 60 days to attempt to serve the notice by personal service, which also includes substitute service by leaving a copy at the usual place of abode with some person of the family or a person residing there, of the age of 13 years or upwards. If, after 3 attempts at service in this manner, no service of the notice is accomplished, then the notice shall be posted in a conspicuous manner at this address and service shall be made by the posting.
            The attempts at service and the posting, if
        	
required, shall be documented by the person attempting service and said documentation shall be made part of a return of service returned to the State's Attorney.
            The State's Attorney may utilize a Sheriff or
        	
Deputy Sheriff, any peace officer, a private process server or investigator, or any employee, agent, or investigator of the State's Attorney's office to attempt service without seeking leave of court.
            After the procedures are followed, service shall
        	
be effective on an owner or interest holder on the date of receipt by the State's Attorney of a return receipt, or on the date of receipt of a communication from an owner or interest holder documenting actual notice, whichever is first in time, or on the date of the last act performed by the State's Attorney in attempting personal service under item (ii) of this paragraph (1). If notice is to be shown by actual notice from communication with a claimant, then the State's Attorney shall file an affidavit providing details of the communication, which shall be accepted as sufficient proof of service by the court.
            For purposes of notice under this Section, if a
        	
person has been arrested for the conduct giving rise to the forfeiture, the address provided to the arresting agency at the time of arrest shall be deemed to be that person's known address. Provided, however, if an owner or interest holder's address changes prior to the effective date of the complaint for forfeiture, the owner or interest holder shall promptly notify the seizing agency of the change in address or, if the owner or interest holder's address changes subsequent to the effective date of the notice of pending forfeiture, the owner or interest holder shall promptly notify the State's Attorney of the change in address; or if the property seized is a conveyance, to the address reflected in the office of the agency or official in which title to or interest in the conveyance is required by law to be recorded.
        (2) If the owner's or interest holder's address is
    	
not known, and is not on record, then notice shall be served by publication for 3 successive weeks in a newspaper of general circulation in the county in which the seizure occurred.
        (3) Notice to any business entity, corporation,
    	
limited liability company, limited liability partnership, or partnership shall be completed by a single mailing of a copy of the notice by certified mail, return receipt requested, and first class mail to that address. This notice is complete regardless of the return of a signed return receipt.
        (4) Notice to a person whose address is not within
    	
the State shall be completed by a single mailing of a copy of the notice by certified mail, return receipt requested, and first class mail to that address. This notice is complete regardless of the return of a signed return receipt.
        (5) Notice to a person whose address is not within
    	
the United States shall be completed by a single mailing of a copy of the notice by certified mail, return receipt requested, and first class mail to that address. This notice shall be complete regardless of the return of a signed return receipt. If certified mail is not available in the foreign country where the person has an address, then notice shall proceed by publication under paragraph (2) of this Section.
        (6) Notice to any person whom the State's Attorney
    	
reasonably should know is incarcerated within the State shall also include mailing a copy of the notice by certified mail, return receipt requested, and first class mail to the address of the detention facility with the inmate's name clearly marked on the envelope.

    (b) A claimant or a party interested in personal property contained within a seized conveyance may file a motion with the court in a judicial forfeiture action for the return of any personal property contained within a conveyance seized under this Article. The return of personal property shall not be unreasonably withheld if the personal property is not mechanically or electrically coupled to the conveyance, needed for evidentiary purposes, or otherwise contraband. A law enforcement agency that returns property under a court order under this Section shall not be liable to any person who claims ownership to the property if the property is returned to an improper party.

    Sec. 36-2.5. Judicial in rem procedures.
    (a) The laws of evidence relating to civil actions shall apply to judicial in rem proceedings under this Article.
    (b) Only an owner of or interest holder in the property may file an answer asserting a claim against the property in the action in rem. For purposes of this Section, the owner or interest holder shall be referred to as claimant. A person not named in the forfeiture complaint who claims to have an interest in the property may petition to intervene as a claimant under Section 2-408 of the Code of Civil Procedure.
    (c) The answer shall be filed with the court within 45 days after service of the civil in rem complaint.
    (d) The trial shall be held within 60 days after filing of the answer unless continued for good cause.
    (e) In its case in chief, the State shall show by a preponderance of the evidence that:
        (1) the property is subject to forfeiture; and
        (2) at least one of the following:
            (i) the claimant knew or should have known that
        	
the conduct was likely to occur; or
            (ii) the claimant is not the true owner of the
        	
property that is subject to forfeiture.
    In any forfeiture case under this Article, a claimant may present evidence to overcome evidence presented by the State that the property is subject to forfeiture.
    (f) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section, the State's burden of proof at the trial of the forfeiture action shall be by clear and convincing evidence if:
        (1) a finding of not guilty is entered as to all
    	
counts and all defendants in a criminal proceeding relating to the conduct giving rise to the forfeiture action; or
        (2) the State receives an adverse finding at a
    	
preliminary hearing and fails to secure an indictment in a criminal proceeding related to the factual allegations of the forfeiture action.
    (g) If the State does not meet its burden of proof, the court shall order the interest in the property returned or conveyed to the claimant and shall order all other property in which the State does meet its burden of proof forfeited to the State. If the State does meet its burden of proof, the court shall order all property forfeited to the State.
    (h) A defendant convicted in any criminal proceeding is precluded from later denying the essential allegations of the criminal offense of which the defendant was convicted in any proceeding under this Article regardless of the pendency of an appeal from that conviction. However, evidence of the pendency of an appeal is admissible.
    (i) An acquittal or dismissal in a criminal proceeding shall not preclude civil proceedings under this Act; however, for good cause shown, on a motion by either party, the court may stay civil forfeiture proceedings during the criminal trial for a related criminal indictment or information alleging a violation of law authorizing forfeiture under Section 36-1 of this Article.
    (j) Title to all property declared forfeited under this Act vests in this State on the commission of the conduct giving rise to forfeiture together with the proceeds of the property after that time. Except as otherwise provided in this Article, any property or proceeds subsequently transferred to any person remain subject to forfeiture unless a person to whom the property was transferred makes an appropriate claim under or has the claim adjudicated at the judicial in rem hearing.
    (k) No property shall be forfeited under this Article from a person who, without actual or constructive notice that the property was the subject of forfeiture proceedings, obtained possession of the property as a bona fide purchaser for value. A person who purports to transfer property after receiving actual or constructive notice that the property is subject to seizure or forfeiture is guilty of contempt of court and shall be liable to the State for a penalty in the amount of the fair market value of the property.
    (l) A civil action under this Article shall be commenced within 5 years after the last conduct giving rise to forfeiture became known or should have become known or 5 years after the forfeitable property is discovered, whichever is later, excluding any time during which either the property or claimant is out of the State or in confinement or during which criminal proceedings relating to the same conduct are in progress.
    (m) If property is ordered forfeited under this Article from a claimant who held title to the property in joint tenancy or tenancy in common with another claimant, the court shall determine the amount of each owner's interest in the property according to principles of property law.

    Sec. 36-2.7. Innocent owner hearing.
    (a) After a complaint for forfeiture has been filed and all claimants have appeared and answered, a claimant may file a motion with the court for an innocent owner hearing prior to trial. This motion shall be made and supported by sworn affidavit and shall assert the following along with specific facts that support each assertion:
        (1) that the claimant filing the motion is the true
    	
owner of the conveyance as interpreted by case law; and
        (2) that the claimant did not know or did not have
    	
reason to know the conduct giving rise to the forfeiture was likely to occur.
    The claimant's motion shall include specific facts that support these assertions.
    (b) Upon the filing, a hearing may only be conducted after the parties have been given the opportunity to conduct limited discovery as to the ownership and control of the property, the claimant's knowledge, or any matter relevant to the issues raised or facts alleged in the claimant's motion. Discovery shall be limited to the People's requests in these areas but may proceed by any means allowed in the Code of Civil Procedure.
    (c) After discovery is complete and the court has allowed for sufficient time to review and investigate the discovery responses, the court shall conduct a hearing. At the hearing, the fact that the conveyance is subject to forfeiture shall not be at issue. The court shall only hear evidence relating to the issue of innocent ownership.
    (d) At the hearing on the motion, the claimant shall bear the burden of proving each of the assertions listed in subsection (a) of this Section by a preponderance of the evidence. If a claimant meets the burden of proof, the court shall grant the motion and order the conveyance returned to the claimant. If the claimant fails to meet the burden of proof, the court shall deny the motion and the forfeiture case shall proceed according to the Code of Civil Procedure.

    (b) No vessel or watercraft, vehicle, or aircraft shall be forfeited under the provisions of Section 36-2 of this Article by reason of any act or omission committed or omitted by any person other than such owner while such vessel or watercraft, vehicle, or aircraft was unlawfully in the possession of a person who acquired possession thereof in violation of the criminal laws of the United States, or of any state.

Amounts distributed to the agency or agencies shall be used, at the discretion of the agency, for the enforcement of criminal laws; or for public education in the community or schools in the prevention or detection of the abuse of drugs or alcohol; or for security cameras used for the prevention or detection of violence, except that amounts distributed to the Secretary of State shall be deposited into the Secretary of State Evidence Fund to be used as provided in Section 2-115 of the Illinois Vehicle Code.

    (b) A person who violates this Section is liable to the owner or person in possession of the real property on which the garbage, rubbish, trash, or refuse is dumped, deposited, or placed for the reasonable costs incurred by the owner or person in possession for cleaning up and properly disposing of the garbage, rubbish, trash, or refuse, and for reasonable attorneys' fees.
    (c) A person violating this Section is guilty of a Class B misdemeanor for which the court must impose a minimum fine of $500. A second conviction for an offense committed after the first conviction is a Class A misdemeanor for which the court must impose a minimum fine of $500. A third or subsequent violation, committed after a second conviction, is a Class 4 felony for which the court must impose a minimum fine of $500. A person who violates this Section and who has an equity interest in a motor vehicle used in violation of this Section is presumed to have the financial resources to pay the minimum fine not exceeding his or her equity interest in the vehicle. Personal property used by a person in violation of this Section shall on the third or subsequent conviction of the person be forfeited to the county where the violation occurred and disposed of at a public sale. Before the forfeiture, the court shall conduct a hearing to determine whether property is subject to forfeiture under this Section. At the forfeiture hearing the State has the burden of establishing by a preponderance of the evidence that property is subject to forfeiture under this Section. Property seized or forfeited under this Section is subject to reporting under the Seizure and Forfeiture Reporting Act.
    (d) The statutory minimum fine required by subsection (c) is not subject to reduction or suspension unless the defendant is indigent. If the defendant files a motion with the court asserting his or her inability to pay the mandatory fine required by this Section, the court must set a hearing on the motion before sentencing. The court must require an affidavit signed by the defendant containing sufficient information to ascertain the assets and liabilities of the defendant. If the court determines that the defendant is indigent, the court must require that the defendant choose either to pay the minimum fine of $500 or to perform 100 hours of community service.

    Sec. 48-2. Animal research and production facilities protection.
    (a) Definitions.
        "Animal" means every living creature, domestic or
    	
wild, but does not include man.
        "Animal facility" means any facility engaging in
    	
legal scientific research or agricultural production of or involving the use of animals including any organization with a primary purpose of representing livestock production or processing, any organization with a primary purpose of promoting or marketing livestock or livestock products, any person licensed to practice veterinary medicine, any institution as defined in the Impounding and Disposition of Stray Animals Act, and any organization with a primary purpose of representing any such person, organization, or institution. "Animal facility" shall include the owner, operator, and employees of any animal facility and any premises where animals are located.
        "Director" means the Director of the Illinois
    	
Department of Agriculture or the Director's authorized representative.
    (b) Legislative Declaration. There has been an increasing number of illegal acts committed against animal research and production facilities involving injury or loss of life to humans or animals, criminal trespass and damage to property. These actions not only abridge the property rights of the owner of the facility, they may also damage the public interest by jeopardizing crucial scientific, biomedical, or agricultural research or production. These actions can also threaten the public safety by possibly exposing communities to serious public health concerns and creating traffic hazards. These actions may substantially disrupt or damage publicly funded research and can result in the potential loss of physical and intellectual property. Therefore, it is in the interest of the people of the State of Illinois to protect the welfare of humans and animals as well as productive use of public funds to require regulation to prevent unauthorized possession, alteration, destruction, or transportation of research records, test data, research materials, equipment, research and agricultural production animals.
    (c) It shall be unlawful for any person:
        (1) to release, steal, or otherwise intentionally
    	
cause the death, injury, or loss of any animal at or from an animal facility and not authorized by that facility;
        (2) to damage, vandalize, or steal any property in or
    	
on an animal facility;
        (3) to obtain access to an animal facility by false
    	
pretenses for the purpose of performing acts not authorized by that facility;
        (4) to enter into an animal facility with an intent
    	
to destroy, alter, duplicate, or obtain unauthorized possession of records, data, materials, equipment, or animals;
        (5) by theft or deception knowingly to obtain control
    	
or to exert control over records, data, material, equipment, or animals of any animal facility for the purpose of depriving the rightful owner or animal facility of the records, material, data, equipment, or animals or for the purpose of concealing, abandoning, or destroying these records, material, data, equipment, or animals; or
        (6) to enter or remain on an animal facility with the
    	
intent to commit an act prohibited under this Section.
    (d) Sentence.
        (1) Any person who violates any provision of
    	
subsection (c) shall be guilty of a Class 4 felony for each violation, unless the loss, theft, or damage to the animal facility property exceeds $300 in value.
        (2) If the loss, theft, or damage to the animal
    	
facility property exceeds $300 in value but does not exceed $10,000 in value, the person is guilty of a Class 3 felony.
        (3) If the loss, theft, or damage to the animal
    	
facility property exceeds $10,000 in value but does not exceed $100,000 in value, the person is guilty of a Class 2 felony.
        (4) If the loss, theft, or damage to the animal
    	
facility property exceeds $100,000 in value, the person is guilty of a Class 1 felony.
        (5) Any person who, with the intent that any
    	
violation of any provision of subsection (c) be committed, agrees with another to the commission of the violation and commits an act in furtherance of this agreement is guilty of the same class of felony as provided in paragraphs (1) through (4) of this subsection for that violation.
        (6) Restitution.
            (A) The court shall conduct a hearing to
        	
determine the reasonable cost of replacing materials, data, equipment, animals and records that may have been damaged, destroyed, lost or cannot be returned, and the reasonable cost of repeating any experimentation that may have been interrupted or invalidated as a result of a violation of subsection (c).
            (B) Any persons convicted of a violation shall be
        	
ordered jointly and severally to make restitution to the owner, operator, or both, of the animal facility in the full amount of the reasonable cost determined under paragraph (A).
    (e) Private right of action. Nothing in this Section shall preclude any animal facility injured in its business or property by a violation of this Section from seeking appropriate relief under any other provision of law or remedy including the issuance of a permanent injunction against any person who violates any provision of this Section. The animal facility owner or operator may petition the court to permanently enjoin the person from violating this Section and the court shall provide this relief.
    (f) The Director shall have authority to investigate any alleged violation of this Section, along with any other law enforcement agency, and may take any action within the Director's authority necessary for the enforcement of this Section. State's Attorneys, State police and other law enforcement officials shall provide any assistance required in the conduct of an investigation and prosecution. Before the Director reports a violation for prosecution he or she may give the owner or operator of the animal facility and the alleged violator an opportunity to present his or her views at an administrative hearing. The Director may adopt any rules and regulations necessary for the enforcement of this Section.
