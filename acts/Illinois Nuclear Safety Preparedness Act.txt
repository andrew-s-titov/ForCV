    (420 ILCS 5/2) (from Ch. 111 1/2, par. 4302)
    Sec. 2. It is declared to be the policy of the General Assembly to protect the people of the State of Illinois against adverse health effects resulting from radiological accidents by establishing a mechanism for emergency preparedness to mitigate the effects of such accidents. The General Assembly finds that it is appropriate that the nuclear industry bear costs associated with preparing and implementing plans to deal with the effects of nuclear accidents. The fees assessed by this Act are intended to cover the costs of the Nuclear Safety Preparedness Program authorized by this Act.

    Sec. 8. (a) The Illinois Nuclear Safety Preparedness Program shall consist of an assessment of the potential nuclear accidents, their radiological consequences, and the necessary protective actions required to mitigate the effects of such accidents. It shall include, but not necessarily be limited to:
        (1) Development of a remote effluent monitoring
    	
system capable of reliably detecting and quantifying accidental radioactive releases from nuclear power plants to the environment;
        (2) Development of an environmental monitoring
    	
program for nuclear facilities other than nuclear power plants;
        (3) Development of procedures for radiological
    	
assessment and radiation exposure control for areas surrounding each nuclear facility in Illinois;
        (4) Radiological training of state and local
    	
emergency response personnel in accordance with the Agency's responsibilities under the program;
        (5) Participation in the development of accident
    	
scenarios and in the exercising of fixed facility nuclear emergency response plans;
        (6) Development of mitigative emergency planning
    	
standards including, but not limited to, standards pertaining to evacuations, re-entry into evacuated areas, contaminated foodstuffs and contaminated water supplies;
        (7) Provision of specialized response equipment
    	
necessary to accomplish this task;
        (8) Implementation of the Boiler and Pressure Vessel
    	
Safety program at nuclear steam-generating facilities as mandated by Section 2005-35 of the Department of Nuclear Safety Law, or its successor statute;

    (b) The Agency may incorporate data collected by the operator of a nuclear facility into the Agency's remote monitoring system.
    (c) The owners of each nuclear power reactor in Illinois shall provide the Agency all system status signals which initiate Emergency Action Level Declarations, actuate accident mitigation and provide mitigation verification as directed by the Agency. The Agency shall designate by rule those system status signals that must be provided. Signals providing indication of operating power level shall also be provided. The owners of the nuclear power reactors shall, at their expense, ensure that valid signals will be provided continuously 24 hours a day.
    All such signals shall be provided in a manner and at a frequency specified by the Agency for incorporation into and augmentation of the remote effluent monitoring system specified in subsection (a) (1) of this Section. Provision shall be made for assuring that such system status and power level signals shall be available to the Agency during reactor operation as well as throughout accidents and subsequent recovery operations.
    For nuclear reactors with operating licenses issued by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission prior to the effective date of this amendatory Act, such system status and power level signals shall be provided to the Department of Nuclear Safety (of which the Agency is the successor) by March 1, 1985. For reactors without such a license on the effective date of this amendatory Act, such signals shall be provided to the Department prior to commencing initial fuel load for such reactor. Nuclear reactors receiving their operating license after the effective date of this amendatory Act, but before July 1, 1985, shall provide such system status and power level signals to the Department of Nuclear Safety (of which the Agency is the successor) by September 1, 1985.
