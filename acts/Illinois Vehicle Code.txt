    (a) The Secretary of State, for the purpose of more effectively carrying out the provisions of the laws in relation to motor vehicles, shall have power to appoint such number of investigators as he may deem necessary. It shall be the duty of such investigators to investigate and enforce violations of the provisions of this Act administered by the Secretary of State and provisions of Chapters 11, 12, 13, 14, and 15 and to investigate and report any violation by any person who operates as a motor carrier of property as defined in Section 18-100 of this Act and does not hold a valid certificate or permit.

    In all convictions for offenses in violation of this Act, the Court may order restitution to the Secretary of any or all sums expended for the purchase of evidence, for the employment of persons to obtain evidence, and for the payment for any goods or services related to obtaining evidence.

    Sec. 2-118. Hearings.
    (a) Upon the suspension, revocation or denial of the issuance of a license, permit, registration or certificate of title under this Code of any person the Secretary of State shall immediately notify such person in writing and upon his written request shall, within 20 days after receipt thereof, set a date for a hearing to commence within 90 calendar days from the date of the written request for all requests related to a suspension, revocation, or the denial of the issuance of a license, permit, registration, or certificate of title occurring after July 1, 2002, in the County of Sangamon, the County of Jefferson, or the County of Cook, as such person may specify, unless both parties agree that such hearing may be held in some other county. The Secretary may require the payment of a fee of not more than $50 for the filing of any petition, motion, or request for hearing conducted pursuant to this Section. These fees must be deposited into the Secretary of State DUI Administration Fund, a special fund created in the State treasury, and, subject to appropriation and as directed by the Secretary of State, shall be used for operation of the Department of Administrative Hearings of the Office of the Secretary of State and for no other purpose. The Secretary shall establish by rule the amount and the procedures, terms, and conditions relating to these fees.
    (b) At any time after the suspension, revocation or denial of a license, permit, registration or certificate of title of any person as hereinbefore referred to, the Secretary of State, in his or her discretion and without the necessity of a request by such person, may hold such a hearing, upon not less than 10 days' notice in writing, in the Counties of Sangamon, Jefferson, or Cook or in any other county agreed to by the parties.
    (c) Upon any such hearing, the Secretary of State, or his authorized agent may administer oaths and issue subpoenas for the attendance of witnesses and the production of relevant books and records and may require an examination of such person. Upon any such hearing, the Secretary of State shall either rescind or, good cause appearing therefor, continue, change or extend the Order of Revocation or Suspension, or upon petition therefore and subject to the provisions of this Code, issue a restricted driving permit or reinstate the license or permit of such person.
    (d) All hearings and hearing procedures shall comply with requirements of the Constitution, so that no person is deprived of due process of law nor denied equal protection of the laws. All hearings shall be held before the Secretary of State or before such persons as may be designated by the Secretary of State and appropriate records of such hearings shall be kept. Where a transcript of the hearing is taken, the person requesting the hearing shall have the opportunity to order a copy thereof at his own expense. The Secretary of State shall enter an order upon any hearing conducted under this Section, related to a suspension, revocation, or the denial of the issuance of a license, permit, registration, or certificate of title occurring after July 1, 2002, within 90 days of its conclusion and shall immediately notify the person in writing of his or her action.
    (d-5) Any hearing over which the Secretary of State has jurisdiction because of a person's implied consent to testing of the person's blood, breath, other bodily substance, or urine for the presence of alcohol, drugs, or intoxicating compounds may be conducted upon a review of the official police reports. Either party, however, may subpoena the arresting officer and any other law enforcement officer who was involved in the petitioner's arrest or processing after arrest, as well as any other person whose testimony may be probative to the issues at the hearing. The failure of a law enforcement officer to answer the subpoena shall be considered grounds for a continuance if, in the hearing officer's discretion, the continuance is appropriate. The failure of the arresting officer to answer a subpoena shall not, in and of itself, be considered grounds for the rescission of an implied consent suspension. Rather, the hearing shall proceed on the basis of the other evidence available, and the hearing officer shall assign this evidence whatever probative value is deemed appropriate. The decision whether to rescind shall be based upon the totality of the evidence.
    (e) The action of the Secretary of State in suspending, revoking or denying any license, permit, registration, or certificate of title shall be subject to judicial review in the Circuit Court of Sangamon County, in the Circuit Court of Jefferson County, or in the Circuit Court of Cook County, and the provisions of the Administrative Review Law, and all amendments and modifications thereto, and the rules adopted pursuant thereto, are hereby adopted and shall apply to and govern every action for the judicial review of final acts or decisions of the Secretary of State hereunder.

    Sec. 2-124. Audits, interest and penalties.
    (a) Audits. The Secretary of State or employees and agents designated by him, may audit the books, records, tax returns, reports, and any and all other pertinent records or documents of any person licensed or registered, or required to be licensed or registered, under any provisions of this Act, for the purpose of determining whether such person has not paid any fees or taxes required to be paid to the Secretary of State and due to the State of Illinois. For purposes of this Section, "person" means an individual, corporation, or partnership, or an officer or an employee of any corporation, including a dissolved corporation, or a member or an employee of any partnership, who as an officer, employee, or member under a duty to perform the act in respect to which the violation occurs.
    (b) Joint Audits. The Secretary of State may enter into reciprocal audit agreements with officers, agents or agencies of another State or States, for joint audits of any person subject to audit under this Act.
    (c) Special Audits. If the Secretary of State is not satisfied with the books, records and documents made available for an audit, or if the Secretary of State is unable to determine therefrom whether any fees or taxes are due to the State of Illinois, or if there is cause to believe that the person audited has declined or refused to supply the books, records and documents necessary to determine whether a deficiency exists, the Secretary of State may either seek a court order for production of any and all books, records and documents he deems relevant and material, or, in his discretion, the Secretary of State may instead give written notice to such person requiring him to produce any and all books, records and documents necessary to properly audit and determine whether any fees or taxes are due to the State of Illinois. If such person fails, refuses or declines to comply with either the court order or written notice within the time specified, the Secretary of State shall then order a special audit at the expense of the person affected. Upon completion of the special audit, the Secretary of State shall determine if any fees or taxes required to be paid under this Act have not been paid, and make an assessment of any deficiency based upon the books, records and documents available to him, and in an assessment, he may rely upon records of other persons having an operation similar to that of the person audited specially. A person audited specially and subject to a court order and in default thereof, shall in addition, be subject to any penalty or punishment imposed by the court entering the order.
    (d) Deficiency; Audit Costs. When a deficiency is found and any fees or taxes required to be paid under this Act have not been paid to the State of Illinois, the Secretary of State may impose an audit fee of $100 per day, or $50 per half-day, per auditor, plus in the case of out-of-state travel, transportation expenses incurred by the auditor or auditors. Where more than one person is audited on the same out-of-state trip, the additional transportation expenses may be apportioned. The actual costs of a special audit shall be imposed upon the person audited.
    (e) Interest. When a deficiency is found and any fees or taxes required to be paid under this Act have not been paid to the State of Illinois, the amount of the deficiency, if greater than $100 for all registration years examined, shall also bear interest at the rate of 1/2 of 1% per month or fraction thereof, from the date when the fee or tax due should have been paid under the provisions of this Act, subject to a maximum of 6% per annum.
    (f) Willful Negligence. When a deficiency is determined by the Secretary to be caused by the willful neglect or negligence of the person audited, an additional 10% penalty, that is 10% of the amount of the deficiency or assessment, shall be imposed, and the 10% penalty shall bear interest at the rate of 1/2 of 1% on and after the 30th day after the penalty is imposed until paid in full.
    (g) Fraud or Evasion. When a deficiency is determined by the Secretary to be caused by fraud or willful evasion of the provisions of this Act, an additional penalty, that is 20% of the amount of the deficiency or assessment, shall be imposed, and the 20% penalty shall bear interest at the rate of 1/2 of 1% on and after the 30th day after the penalty is imposed until paid in full.
    (h) Notice. The Secretary of State shall give written notice to any person audited, of the amount of any deficiency found or assessment made, of the costs of an audit or special audit, and of the penalty imposed, and payment shall be made within 30 days of the date of the notice unless such person petitions for a hearing.
    However, except in the case of fraud or willful evasion, or the inaccessibility of books and records for audit or with the express consent of the person audited, no notice of a deficiency or assessment shall be issued by the Secretary for more than 3 registration years. This limitation shall commence on any January 1 as to calendar year registrations and on any July 1 as to fiscal year registrations. This limitation shall not apply for any period during which the person affected has declined or refuses to make his books and records available for audit, nor during any period of time in which an Order of any Court has the effect of enjoining or restraining the Secretary from making an audit or issuing a notice. Notwithstanding, each person licensed under the International Registration Plan and audited by this State or any member jurisdiction shall follow the assessment and refund procedures as adopted and amended by the International Registration Plan members. The Secretary of State shall have the final decision as to which registrants may be subject to the netting of audit fees as outlined in the International Registration Plan. Persons audited may be subject to a review process to determine the final outcome of the audit finding. This process shall follow the adopted procedure as outlined in the International Registration Plan. All decisions by the IRP designated tribunal shall be binding.
    (i) Every person subject to licensing or registration and audit under the provisions of this Chapter shall retain all pertinent licensing and registration documents, books, records, tax returns, reports and all supporting records and documents for a period of 4 years.
    (j) Hearings. Any person receiving written notice of a deficiency or assessment may, within 30 days after the date of the notice, petition for a hearing before the Secretary of State or his duly appointed hearing officer to contest the audit in whole or in part, and the petitioner shall simultaneously file a certified check or money order, or certificate of deposit, or a surety bond approved by the Secretary in the amount of the deficiency or assessment. Hearings shall be held pursuant to the provisions of Section 2-118 of this Act.
    (k) Judgments. The Secretary of State may enforce any notice of deficiency or assessment pursuant to the provisions of Section 3-831 of this Act.

    Sec. 3-109. Registration without certificate of title; bond. If the Secretary of State is not satisfied as to the ownership of the vehicle, including, but not limited to, in the case of a manufactured home, a circumstance in which the manufactured home is covered by a Manufacturer's Statement of Origin that the owner of the manufactured home, after diligent search and inquiry, is unable to produce, or that there are no undisclosed security interests in it, the Secretary of State may register the vehicle but shall:
        (a) Withhold issuance of a certificate of title until
    	
the applicant presents documents reasonably sufficient to satisfy the Secretary of State as to the applicant's ownership of the vehicle and that there are no undisclosed security interests in it;
        (b) As a condition of issuing a certificate of title,
    	
require the applicant to file with the Secretary of State a bond in the form prescribed by the Secretary of State and executed by the applicant, and either accompanied by the deposit of cash with the Secretary of State or also executed by a person authorized to conduct a surety business in this State. The bond shall be in an amount equal to one and one-half times the value of the vehicle as determined by the Secretary of State and conditioned to indemnify any prior owner and lienholder and any subsequent purchaser of the vehicle or person acquiring any security interest in it, and their respective successors in interest, against any expense, loss or damage, including reasonable attorney's fees, by reason of the issuance of the certificate of title of the vehicle or on account of any defect in or undisclosed security interest upon the right, title and interest of the applicant in and to the vehicle. Any such interested person has a right of action to recover on the bond for any breach of its conditions, but the aggregate liability of the surety to all persons shall not exceed the amount of the bond. The bond, and any deposit accompanying it, shall be returned at the end of 3 years or prior thereto if (i) the vehicle is no longer registered in this State and the currently valid certificate of title is surrendered to the Secretary of State or (ii) in the case of a certificate of title to a manufactured home, the currently valid certificate of title is surrendered to the Secretary of State in accordance with Section 3-116.2; unless the Secretary of State has been notified of the pendency of an action to recover on the bond; or
        (b-5) Require the applicant to file with the
    	
Secretary of State an application for a provisional title in the form prescribed by the Secretary and executed by the applicant, and accompanied by a $50 fee to be deposited in the CDLIS/AAMVAnet/NMVTIS Trust Fund. The Secretary shall designate by rule the documentation acceptable for an individual to apply for a provisional title. A provisional title shall be valid for 3 years and is nontransferable for the 3-year period. A provisional title shall be clearly marked and otherwise distinguished from a certificate of title. Three years after the issuance of a provisional title, the provisional title holder shall apply for the appropriate transferrable title in the applicant's name. If a claim of ownership for the vehicle is brought against a holder of a provisional title, then the provisional title holder shall apply for a bond under subsection (b) of this Section for the amount of time remaining on the provisional title. A provisional title holder or an individual who asserts a claim to the motor vehicle may petition a circuit court of competent jurisdiction for an order to determine the ownership of the vehicle. A provisional title shall not be available to individuals or entities that rebuild, repair, store, or tow vehicles or have a claim against the vehicle under the Labor and Storage Lien Act or the Labor and Storage Lien (Small Amount) Act.
        Security deposited as a bond hereunder shall be
    	
placed by the Secretary of State in the custody of the State Treasurer.
    During July, annually, the Secretary shall compile a list of all bonds on deposit, pursuant to this Section, for more than 3 years and concerning which he has received no notice as to the pendency of any judicial proceeding that could affect the disposition thereof. Thereupon, he shall promptly send a notice by certified mail to the last known address of each depositor advising him that his bond will be subject to escheat to the State of Illinois if not claimed within 30 days after the mailing date of such notice. At the expiration of such time, the Secretary of State shall file with the State Treasurer an order directing the transfer of such deposit to the Road Fund in the State Treasury. Upon receipt of such order, the State Treasurer shall make such transfer, after converting to cash any other type of security. Thereafter any person having a legal claim against such deposit may enforce it by appropriate proceedings in the Court of Claims subject to the limitations prescribed for such Court. At the expiration of such limitation period such deposit shall escheat to the State of Illinois.

    Sec. 3-112. Transfer.
    (a) If an owner transfers his interest in a vehicle, other than by the creation of a security interest, at the time of the delivery of the vehicle he shall execute to the transferee an assignment and warranty of title in the space provided on the certificate of title, or as the Secretary of State prescribes, and cause the certificate and assignment to be mailed or delivered to the transferee or to the Secretary of State.
    If the vehicle is subject to a tax under the Mobile Home Local Services Tax Act in a county with a population of less than 3,000,000, the owner shall also provide to the transferee a certification by the treasurer of the county in which the vehicle is situated that all taxes imposed upon the vehicle for the years the owner was the actual titleholder of the vehicle have been paid. The transferee shall be liable only for the taxes he or she incurred while he or she was the actual titleholder of the mobile home. The county treasurer shall refund any amount of taxes paid by the transferee that were imposed in years when the transferee was not the actual titleholder. The provisions of this amendatory Act of 1997 (P.A. 90-542) apply retroactively to January 1, 1996. In no event may the county treasurer refund amounts paid by the transferee during any year except the 10 years immediately preceding the year in which the refund is made. If the owner is a licensed dealer who has purchased the vehicle and is holding it for resale, in lieu of acquiring a certification from the county treasurer he shall forward the certification received from the previous owner to the next buyer of the vehicle. The owner shall cause the certification to be mailed or delivered to the Secretary of State with the certificate of title and assignment.
    (b) Except as provided in Section 3-113, the transferee shall, promptly and within 20 days after delivery to him of the vehicle and the assigned title, execute the application for a new certificate of title in the space provided therefor on the certificate or as the Secretary of State prescribes, and cause the certificate and application to be mailed or delivered to the Secretary of State.
    (c) Upon request of the owner or transferee, a lienholder in possession of the certificate of title shall, unless the transfer was a breach of his security agreement, either deliver the certificate to the transferee for delivery to the Secretary of State or, upon receipt from the transferee of the owner's assignment, the transferee's application for a new certificate and the required fee, mail or deliver them to the Secretary of State. The delivery of the certificate does not affect the rights of the lienholder under his security agreement.
    (d) If a security interest is reserved or created at the time of the transfer, the certificate of title shall be retained by or delivered to the person who becomes the lienholder, and the parties shall comply with the provisions of Section 3-203.
    (e) Except as provided in Section 3-113 and as between the parties, a transfer by an owner is not effective until the provisions of this Section and Section 3-115 have been complied with; however, an owner who has delivered possession of the vehicle to the transferee and has complied with the provisions of this Section and Section 3-115 requiring action by him as not liable as owner for any damages thereafter resulting from operation of the vehicle.
    (f) The Secretary of State shall not process any application for a transfer of an interest in a vehicle if any fees or taxes due under this Act from the transferor or the transferee have not been paid upon reasonable notice and demand.
    (g) If the Secretary of State receives an application for transfer of a vehicle subject to a tax under the Mobile Home Local Services Tax Act in a county with a population of less than 3,000,000, such application must be accompanied by the required certification by the county treasurer or tax assessor authorizing the issuance of the title.

    (625 ILCS 5/3-112.1) (from Ch. 95 1/2, par. 3-112.1)
    Sec. 3-112.1. Odometer.
    (a) All titles issued by the Secretary of State beginning January, 1990, shall provide for an odometer certification substantially as follows:
    "I certify to the best of my knowledge that the odometer reading is and reflects the actual mileage of the vehicle unless one of the following statements is checked.
...................
    (  )  1. The mileage stated is in excess of its mechanical limits.
    (  )  2. The odometer reading is not the actual mileage. Warning - Odometer Discrepancy."
    (b) When executing any transfer of title which contains the odometer certification as described in paragraph (a) above, each transferor of a motor vehicle must supply on the title form the following information:
        (1) The odometer reading at the time of transfer and
    	
an indication if the mileage is in excess of its mechanical limits or if it is not the actual mileage;
        (2) The date of transfer;
        (3) The transferor's printed name and signature; and
        (4) The transferee's printed name and address.
    (c) The transferee must sign on the title form indicating that he or she is aware of the odometer certification made by the transferor.
    (d) The transferor will not be required to disclose the current odometer reading and the transferee will not have to acknowledge such disclosure under the following circumstances:
        (1) A vehicle having a Gross Vehicle Weight Rating of
    	
more than 16,000 pounds;
        (2) A vehicle that is not self-propelled;
        (3) A vehicle that is 10 years old or older;
        (4) A vehicle sold directly by the manufacturer to
    	
any agency of the United States; and
        (5) A vehicle manufactured without an odometer.
    (e) When the transferor signs the title transfer such transferor acknowledges that he or she is aware that Federal regulations and State law require him or her to state the odometer mileage upon transfer of ownership. An inaccurate or untruthful statement with intent to defraud subjects the transferor to liability for damages to the transferee pursuant to the federal Motor Vehicle Information and Cost Act of 1972, P.L. 92-513 as amended by P.L. 94-364. No transferor shall be liable for damages as provided under this Section who transfers title to a motor vehicle which has an odometer reading that has been altered or tampered with by a previous owner, unless that transferor knew or had reason to know of such alteration or tampering and sold such vehicle with an intent to defraud. A cause of action is hereby created by which any person who, with intent to defraud, violates any requirement imposed under this Section shall be liable in an amount equal to the sum of:
        (1) three times the amount of actual damages
    	
sustained or $1,500, whichever is the greater; and
        (2) in the case of any successful action to enforce
    	
the foregoing liability, the costs of the action together with reasonable attorney fees as determined by the court.
    Any recovery based on a cause of action under this Section shall be offset by any recovery made pursuant to the federal Motor Vehicle Information and Cost Savings Act of 1972.
    (f) The provisions of this Section shall not apply to any motorcycle, motor driven cycle, moped, antique vehicle, or expanded-use antique vehicle.
    (g) The Secretary of State may adopt rules and regulations providing for a transition period for all non-conforming titles.

    Sec. 3-113. Transfer to or from dealer; records.
    (a) After a dealer buys a vehicle and holds it for resale, the dealer must procure the certificate of title from the owner or the lienholder. The dealer may hold the certificate until he or she transfers the vehicle to another person. Upon transferring the vehicle to another person, the dealer shall promptly and within 20 days execute the assignment and warranty of title by a dealer, showing the names and addresses of the transferee and of any lienholder holding a security interest created or reserved at the time of the resale, in the spaces provided therefor on the certificate or as the Secretary of State prescribes, and mail or deliver the certificate to the Secretary of State with the transferee's application for a new certificate, except as provided in Section 3-117.2. A dealer has complied with this Section if the date of the mailing of the certificate, as indicated by the postmark, is within 20 days of the date on which the vehicle was transferred to another person.
    (b) The Secretary of State may decline to process any application for a transfer of an interest in a vehicle if any fees or taxes due under this Code from the transferor or the transferee have not been paid upon reasonable notice and demand.
    (c) Any person who violates this Section shall be guilty of a petty offense.
    (d) Beginning January 1, 2014, the Secretary of State is authorized to impose a delinquent vehicle dealer transfer fee of $20 if the certificate of title is received by the Secretary from the dealer 30 days but less than 60 days after the date of sale. If the certificate of title is received by the Secretary from the dealer 60 days but less than 90 days after the date of sale, the delinquent dealer transfer fee shall be $35. If the certificate of title is received by the Secretary from the dealer 90 days but less than 120 days after the date of sale, the delinquent vehicle dealer transfer fee shall be $65. If the certificate of title is received by the Secretary from the dealer 120 days or more after the date of the sale, the delinquent vehicle dealer transfer fee shall be $100. All monies collected under this subsection shall be deposited into the CDLIS/AAMVAnet/NMVTIS Trust Fund.

    Sec. 3-114. Transfer by operation of law.
    (a) If the interest of an owner in a vehicle passes to another other than by voluntary transfer, the transferee shall, except as provided in paragraph (b), promptly mail or deliver within 20 days to the Secretary of State the last certificate of title, if available, proof of the transfer, and his application for a new certificate in the form the Secretary of State prescribes. It shall be unlawful for any person having possession of a certificate of title for a motor vehicle, semi-trailer, or house car by reason of his having a lien or encumbrance on such vehicle, to fail or refuse to deliver such certificate to the owner, upon the satisfaction or discharge of the lien or encumbrance, indicated upon such certificate of title.
    (b) If the interest of an owner in a vehicle passes to another under the provisions of the Small Estates provisions of the Probate Act of 1975 the transferee shall promptly mail or deliver to the Secretary of State, within 120 days, the last certificate of title, if available, the documentation required under the provisions of the Probate Act of 1975, and an application for certificate of title. The Small Estate Affidavit form shall be furnished by the Secretary of State. The transfer may be to the transferee or to the nominee of the transferee.
    (c) If the interest of an owner in a vehicle passes to another under other provisions of the Probate Act of 1975, as amended, and the transfer is made by a representative or guardian, such transferee shall promptly mail or deliver to the Secretary of State, the last certificate of title, if available, and a certified copy of the letters of office or guardianship, and an application for certificate of title. Such application shall be made before the estate is closed. The transfer may be to the transferee or to the nominee of the transferee.
    (d) If the interest of an owner in joint tenancy passes to the other joint tenant with survivorship rights as provided by law, the transferee shall promptly mail or deliver to the Secretary of State, the last certificate of title, if available, proof of death of the one joint tenant and survivorship of the surviving joint tenant, and an application for certificate of title. Such application shall be made within 120 days after the death of the joint tenant. The transfer may be to the transferee or to the nominee of the transferee.
    (d-5) If the interest of an owner passes to the owner's spouse or if the spouse otherwise acquires ownership of the vehicle, then the transferee shall promptly mail or deliver to the Secretary of State, proof of (i) the owner's death; (ii) the transfer or acquisition of ownership; and (iii) proof of the marital relationship between the owner and the transferee, along with the last certificate of title, if available, and an application for certificate of title along with the appropriate fees and taxes, if applicable. The application shall be made within 180 days after the death of the owner.
    (e) The Secretary of State shall transfer a decedent's vehicle title to any legatee, representative or heir of the decedent who submits to the Secretary a death certificate and an affidavit by an attorney at law on the letterhead stationery of the attorney at law stating the facts of the transfer.
    (f) Repossession with assignment of title. In all cases wherein a lienholder has repossessed a vehicle by other than judicial process and holds it for resale under a security agreement, and the owner of record has executed an assignment of the existing certificate of title after default, the lienholder may proceed to sell or otherwise dispose of the vehicle as authorized under the Uniform Commercial Code. Upon selling the vehicle to another person, the lienholder need not send the certificate of title to the Secretary of State, but shall promptly and within 20 days mail or deliver to the purchaser as transferee the existing certificate of title for the repossessed vehicle, reflecting the release of the lienholder's security interest in the vehicle. The application for a certificate of title made by the purchaser shall comply with subsection (a) of Section 3-104 and be accompanied by the existing certificate of title for the repossessed vehicle. The lienholder shall execute the assignment and warranty of title showing the name and address of the purchaser in the spaces provided therefor on the certificate of title or as the Secretary of State prescribes. The lienholder shall complete the assignment of title in the certificate of title to reflect the transfer of the vehicle to the lienholder and also a reassignment to reflect the transfer from the lienholder to the purchaser. For this purpose, the lienholder is specifically authorized to complete and execute the space reserved in the certificate of title for a dealer reassignment, notwithstanding that the lienholder is not a licensed dealer. Nothing herein shall be construed to mean that the lienholder is taking title to the repossessed vehicle for purposes of liability for retailer occupation, vehicle use, or other tax with respect to the proceeds from the repossession sale. Delivery of the existing certificate of title to the purchaser shall be deemed disclosure to the purchaser of the owner of the vehicle.
    (f-5) Repossession without assignment of title. Subject to subsection (f-30), in all cases wherein a lienholder has repossessed a vehicle by other than judicial process and holds it for resale under a security agreement, and the owner of record has not executed an assignment of the existing certificate of title, the lienholder shall comply with the following provisions:
        (1) Prior to sale, the lienholder shall deliver or
    	
mail to the owner at the owner's last known address and to any other lienholder of record, a notice of redemption setting forth the following information: (i) the name of the owner of record and in bold type at or near the top of the notice a statement that the owner's vehicle was repossessed on a specified date for failure to make payments on the loan (or other reason), (ii) a description of the vehicle subject to the lien sufficient to identify it, (iii) the right of the owner to redeem the vehicle, (iv) the lienholder's intent to sell or otherwise dispose of the vehicle after the expiration of 21 days from the date of mailing or delivery of the notice, and (v) the name, address, and telephone number of the lienholder from whom information may be obtained concerning the amount due to redeem the vehicle and from whom the vehicle may be redeemed under Section 9-623 of the Uniform Commercial Code. At the lienholder's option, the information required to be set forth in this notice of redemption may be made a part of or accompany the notification of sale or other disposition required under Section 9-611 of the Uniform Commercial Code, but none of the information required by this notice shall be construed to impose any requirement under Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code.
        (2) With respect to the repossession of a vehicle
    	
used primarily for personal, family, or household purposes, the lienholder shall also deliver or mail to the owner at the owner's last known address an affidavit of defense. The affidavit of defense shall accompany the notice of redemption required in subdivision (f-5)(1) of this Section. The affidavit of defense shall (i) identify the lienholder, owner, and the vehicle; (ii) provide space for the owner to state the defense claimed by the owner; and (iii) include an acknowledgment by the owner that the owner may be liable to the lienholder for fees, charges, and costs incurred by the lienholder in establishing the insufficiency or invalidity of the owner's defense. To stop the transfer of title, the affidavit of defense must be received by the lienholder no later than 21 days after the date of mailing or delivery of the notice required in subdivision (f-5)(1) of this Section. If the lienholder receives the affidavit from the owner in a timely manner, the lienholder must apply to a court of competent jurisdiction to determine if the lienholder is entitled to possession of the vehicle.
        (3) Upon selling the vehicle to another person, the
    	
lienholder need not send the certificate of title to the Secretary of State, but shall promptly and within 20 days mail or deliver to the purchaser as transferee (i) the existing certificate of title for the repossessed vehicle, reflecting the release of the lienholder's security interest in the vehicle; and (ii) an affidavit of repossession made by or on behalf of the lienholder which provides the following information: that the vehicle was repossessed, a description of the vehicle sufficient to identify it, whether the vehicle has been damaged in excess of 33 1/3% of its fair market value as required under subdivision (b)(3) of Section 3-117.1, that the owner and any other lienholder of record were given the notice required in subdivision (f-5)(1) of this Section, that the owner of record was given the affidavit of defense required in subdivision (f-5)(2) of this Section, that the interest of the owner was lawfully terminated or sold pursuant to the terms of the security agreement, and the purchaser's name and address. If the vehicle is damaged in excess of 33 1/3% of its fair market value, the lienholder shall make application for a salvage certificate under Section 3-117.1 and transfer the vehicle to a person eligible to receive assignments of salvage certificates identified in Section 3-118.
        (4) The application for a certificate of title made
    	
by the purchaser shall comply with subsection (a) of Section 3-104 and be accompanied by the affidavit of repossession furnished by the lienholder and the existing certificate of title for the repossessed vehicle. The lienholder shall execute the assignment and warranty of title showing the name and address of the purchaser in the spaces provided therefor on the certificate of title or as the Secretary of State prescribes. The lienholder shall complete the assignment of title in the certificate of title to reflect the transfer of the vehicle to the lienholder and also a reassignment to reflect the transfer from the lienholder to the purchaser. For this purpose, the lienholder is specifically authorized to execute the assignment on behalf of the owner as seller if the owner has not done so and to complete and execute the space reserved in the certificate of title for a dealer reassignment, notwithstanding that the lienholder is not a licensed dealer. Nothing herein shall be construed to mean that the lienholder is taking title to the repossessed vehicle for purposes of liability for retailer occupation, vehicle use, or other tax with respect to the proceeds from the repossession sale. Delivery of the existing certificate of title to the purchaser shall be deemed disclosure to the purchaser of the owner of the vehicle. In the event the lienholder does not hold the certificate of title for the repossessed vehicle, the lienholder shall make application for and may obtain a new certificate of title in the name of the lienholder upon furnishing information satisfactory to the Secretary of State. Upon receiving the new certificate of title, the lienholder may proceed with the sale described in subdivision (f-5)(3), except that upon selling the vehicle the lienholder shall promptly and within 20 days mail or deliver to the purchaser the new certificate of title reflecting the assignment and transfer of title to the purchaser.
        (5) Neither the lienholder nor the owner shall file
    	
with the Office of the Secretary of State the notice of redemption or affidavit of defense described in subdivisions (f-5)(1) and (f-5)(2) of this Section. The Office of the Secretary of State shall not determine the merits of an owner's affidavit of defense, nor consider any allegations or assertions regarding the validity or invalidity of a lienholder's claim to the vehicle or an owner's asserted defenses to the repossession action.
    (f-7) Notice of reinstatement in certain cases.
        (1) Subject to subsection (f-30), if, at the time of
    	
repossession by a lienholder that is seeking to transfer title pursuant to subsection (f-5), the owner has paid an amount equal to 30% or more of the deferred payment price or total of payments due, the owner may, within 21 days of the date of repossession, reinstate the contract or loan agreement and recover the vehicle from the lienholder by tendering in a lump sum (i) the total of all unpaid amounts, including any unpaid delinquency or deferral charges due at the date of reinstatement, without acceleration; and (ii) performance necessary to cure any default other than nonpayment of the amounts due; and (iii) all reasonable costs and fees incurred by the lienholder in retaking, holding, and preparing the vehicle for disposition and in arranging for the sale of the vehicle. Reasonable costs and fees incurred by the lienholder include without limitation repossession and storage expenses and, if authorized by the contract or loan agreement, reasonable attorneys' fees and collection agency charges.
        (2) Tender of payment and performance pursuant to
    	
this limited right of reinstatement restores to the owner his rights under the contract or loan agreement as though no default had occurred. The owner has the right to reinstate the contract or loan agreement and recover the vehicle from the lienholder only once under this subsection. The lienholder may, in the lienholder's sole discretion, extend the period during which the owner may reinstate the contract or loan agreement and recover the vehicle beyond the 21 days allowed under this subsection, and the extension shall not subject the lienholder to liability to the owner under the laws of this State.
        (3) The lienholder shall deliver or mail written
    	
notice to the owner at the owner's last known address, within 3 business days of the date of repossession, of the owner's right to reinstate the contract or loan agreement and recover the vehicle pursuant to the limited right of reinstatement described in this subsection. At the lienholder's option, the information required to be set forth in this notice of reinstatement may be made part of or accompany the notice of redemption required in subdivision (f-5)(1) of this Section and the notification of sale or other disposition required under Section 9-611 of the Uniform Commercial Code, but none of the information required by this notice of reinstatement shall be construed to impose any requirement under Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code.
        (4) The reinstatement period, if applicable, and the
    	
redemption period described in subdivision (f-5)(1) of this Section, shall run concurrently if the information required to be set forth in the notice of reinstatement is part of or accompanies the notice of redemption. In any event, the 21 day redemption period described in subdivision (f-5)(1) of this Section shall commence on the date of mailing or delivery to the owner of the information required to be set forth in the notice of redemption, and the 21 day reinstatement period described in this subdivision, if applicable, shall commence on the date of mailing or delivery to the owner of the information required to be set forth in the notice of reinstatement.
        (5) The Office of the Secretary of State shall not
    	
determine the merits of an owner's claim of right to reinstatement, nor consider any allegations or assertions regarding the validity or invalidity of a lienholder's claim to the vehicle or an owner's asserted right to reinstatement. Where a lienholder is subject to licensing and regulatory supervision by the State of Illinois, the lienholder shall be subject to all of the powers and authority of the lienholder's primary State regulator to enforce compliance with the procedures set forth in this subsection (f-7).
    (f-10) Repossession by judicial process. In all cases wherein a lienholder has repossessed a vehicle by judicial process and holds it for resale under a security agreement, order for replevin, or other court order establishing the lienholder's right to possession of the vehicle, the lienholder may proceed to sell or otherwise dispose of the vehicle as authorized under the Uniform Commercial Code or the court order. Upon selling the vehicle to another person, the lienholder need not send the certificate of title to the Secretary of State, but shall promptly and within 20 days mail or deliver to the purchaser as transferee (i) the existing certificate of title for the repossessed vehicle reflecting the release of the lienholder's security interest in the vehicle; (ii) a certified copy of the court order; and (iii) a bill of sale identifying the new owner's name and address and the year, make, model, and vehicle identification number of the vehicle. The application for a certificate of title made by the purchaser shall comply with subsection (a) of Section 3-104 and be accompanied by the certified copy of the court order furnished by the lienholder and the existing certificate of title for the repossessed vehicle. The lienholder shall execute the assignment and warranty of title showing the name and address of the purchaser in the spaces provided therefor on the certificate of title or as the Secretary of State prescribes. The lienholder shall complete the assignment of title in the certificate of title to reflect the transfer of the vehicle to the lienholder and also a reassignment to reflect the transfer from the lienholder to the purchaser. For this purpose, the lienholder is specifically authorized to execute the assignment on behalf of the owner as seller if the owner has not done so and to complete and execute the space reserved in the certificate of title for a dealer reassignment, notwithstanding that the lienholder is not a licensed dealer. Nothing herein shall be construed to mean that the lienholder is taking title to the repossessed vehicle for purposes of liability for retailer occupation, vehicle use, or other tax with respect to the proceeds from the repossession sale. Delivery of the existing certificate of title to the purchaser shall be deemed disclosure to the purchaser of the owner of the vehicle. In the event the lienholder does not hold the certificate of title for the repossessed vehicle, the lienholder shall make application for and may obtain a new certificate of title in the name of the lienholder upon furnishing information satisfactory to the Secretary of State. Upon receiving the new certificate of title, the lienholder may proceed with the sale described in this subsection, except that upon selling the vehicle the lienholder shall promptly and within 20 days mail or deliver to the purchaser the new certificate of title reflecting the assignment and transfer of title to the purchaser.
    (f-15) The Secretary of State shall not issue a certificate of title to a purchaser under subsection (f), (f-5), or (f-10) of this Section, unless the person from whom the vehicle has been repossessed by the lienholder is shown to be the last registered owner of the motor vehicle. The Secretary of State may provide by rule for the standards to be followed by a lienholder in assigning and transferring certificates of title with respect to repossessed vehicles.
    (f-20) If applying for a salvage certificate or a junking certificate, the lienholder shall within 20 days make an application to the Secretary of State for a salvage certificate or a junking certificate, as set forth in this Code. The Secretary of State shall not issue a salvage certificate or a junking certificate to such lienholder unless the person from whom such vehicle has been repossessed is shown to be the last registered owner of such motor vehicle and such lienholder establishes to the satisfaction of the Secretary of State that he is entitled to such salvage certificate or junking certificate. The Secretary of State may provide by rule for the standards to be followed by a lienholder in order to obtain a salvage certificate or junking certificate for a repossessed vehicle.
    (f-25) If the interest of an owner in a mobile home, as defined in the Mobile Home Local Services Tax Act, passes to another under the provisions of the Mobile Home Local Services Tax Enforcement Act, the transferee shall promptly mail or deliver to the Secretary of State (i) the last certificate of title, if available, (ii) a certified copy of the court order ordering the transfer of title, and (iii) an application for certificate of title.
    (f-30) Bankruptcy. If the repossessed vehicle is the subject of a bankruptcy proceeding or discharge:
        (1) the lienholder may proceed to sell or otherwise
    	
dispose of the vehicle as authorized by the Bankruptcy Code and the Uniform Commercial Code;
        (2) the notice of redemption, affidavit of defense,
    	
and notice of reinstatement otherwise required to be sent by the lienholder to the owner of record or other lienholder of record under this Section are not required to be delivered or mailed;
        (3) the requirement to delay disposition of the
    	
vehicle for 21 days, (i) from the mailing or delivery of the notice of redemption under subdivision (f-5)(1) of this Section, (ii) from the mailing or delivery of the affidavit of defense under subdivision (f-5)(2) of this Section, or (iii) from the date of repossession when the owner is entitled to a notice of reinstatement under subsection (f-7) of this Section, does not apply;
        (4) the affidavit of repossession that is required
    	
under subdivision (f-5)(3) shall contain a notation of "bankruptcy" where the affidavit requires the date of the mailing or delivery of the notice of redemption. The notation of "bankruptcy" means the lienholder makes no sworn representations regarding the mailing or delivery of the notice of redemption or affidavit of defense or lienholder's compliance with the requirements that otherwise apply to the notices listed in this subsection (f-30), and makes no sworn representation that the lienholder assumes liability or costs for any litigation that may arise from the issuance of a certificate of title based on the excluded representations;
        (5) the right of redemption, the right to assert a
    	
defense to the transfer of title, and reinstatement rights under this Section do not apply; and
        (6) references to judicial process and court orders
    	
in subsection (f-10) of this Section do not include bankruptcy proceedings or orders.
    (g) A person holding a certificate of title whose interest in the vehicle has been extinguished or transferred other than by voluntary transfer shall mail or deliver the certificate, within 20 days upon request of the Secretary of State. The delivery of the certificate pursuant to the request of the Secretary of State does not affect the rights of the person surrendering the certificate, and the action of the Secretary of State in issuing a new certificate of title as provided herein is not conclusive upon the rights of an owner or lienholder named in the old certificate.
    (h) The Secretary of State may decline to process any application for a transfer of an interest in a vehicle hereunder if any fees or taxes due under this Act from the transferor or the transferee have not been paid upon reasonable notice and demand.
    (i) The Secretary of State shall not be held civilly or criminally liable to any person because any purported transferor may not have had the power or authority to make a transfer of any interest in any vehicle or because a certificate of title issued in error is subsequently used to commit a fraudulent act.

When a charitable not-for-profit organization that is exempt from federal income taxation under Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code becomes the recipient of a motor vehicle by means of a donation from an individual, the organization need not send the certificate of title to the Secretary of State. Upon transferring the motor vehicle, the organization shall promptly and within 20 days execute the reassignment to reflect the transfer from the organization to the purchaser. The organization is specifically authorized to complete and execute the space reserved in the certificate of title for a dealer reassignment, notwithstanding that the organization is not a licensed dealer. Nothing in this Section shall be construed to require the organization to become a licensed vehicle dealer.

    (b-5) The Secretary of State, upon receipt of an application for a certificate of title and the required fee, may issue a certificate of title to an out-of-state resident if the out-of-state resident is a bona fide purchaser of a vehicle or a manufactured home from a dealer licensed in this State under Section 5-101, 5-101.2, or 5-102 of this Code and the licensed dealer files for bankruptcy, surrenders his or her license, or is otherwise no longer operating as a licensed dealer and does not properly transfer the title application to the bona fide purchaser prior to the licensed dealer's business closure.
    (c) Any person, firm or corporation, who shall knowingly possess, buy, sell, exchange or give away, or offer to buy, sell, exchange or give away the certificate of title to any motor vehicle which is a junk or salvage, or who shall fail to surrender the certificate of title to the Secretary of State as required under the provisions of this Section and Section 3-117.2, shall be guilty of Class 3 felony.
    (d) The Secretary of State shall file and retain for four (4) years a record of every surrendered certificate of title or proof of ownership accepted by the Secretary of State, the file to be maintained so as to permit the tracing of title of the vehicle designated therein. Such filing and retention requirements shall be in addition to and not in substitution for the recordkeeping requirements set forth in Section 3-106 of this Code, which recordkeeping requirements are not limited to any period of time.
    (e) The Secretary of State, upon receipt of an application for corrected certificate of title, with the original title, the required fee and any other required documents, shall issue a corrected certificate of title in the name of the owner and mail it to the first lienholder named in it or, if none, to the owner or owner's designee.

    Sec. 3-117.1. When junking certificates or salvage certificates must be obtained.
    (a) Except as provided in Chapter 4 and Section 3-117.3 of this Code, a person who possesses a junk vehicle shall within 15 days cause the certificate of title, salvage certificate, certificate of purchase, or a similarly acceptable out-of-state document of ownership to be surrendered to the Secretary of State along with an application for a junking certificate, except as provided in Section 3-117.2, whereupon the Secretary of State shall issue to such a person a junking certificate, which shall authorize the holder thereof to possess, transport, or, by an endorsement, transfer ownership in such junked vehicle, and a certificate of title shall not again be issued for such vehicle. The owner of a junk vehicle is not required to surrender the certificate of title under this subsection if (i) there is no lienholder on the certificate of title or (ii) the owner of the junk vehicle has a valid lien release from the lienholder releasing all interest in the vehicle and the owner applying for the junk certificate matches the current record on the certificate of title file for the vehicle.
    A licensee who possesses a junk vehicle and a Certificate of Title, Salvage Certificate, Certificate of Purchase, or a similarly acceptable out-of-state document of ownership for such junk vehicle, may transport the junk vehicle to another licensee prior to applying for or obtaining a junking certificate, by executing a uniform invoice. The licensee transferor shall furnish a copy of the uniform invoice to the licensee transferee at the time of transfer. In any case, the licensee transferor shall apply for a junking certificate in conformance with Section 3-117.1 of this Chapter. The following information shall be contained on a uniform invoice:
        (1) The business name, address and dealer license
    	
number of the person disposing of the vehicle, junk vehicle or vehicle cowl;
        (2) The name and address of the person acquiring the
    	
vehicle, junk vehicle or vehicle cowl, and if that person is a dealer, the Illinois or out-of-state dealer license number of that dealer;
        (3) The date of the disposition of the vehicle, junk
    	
vehicle or vehicle cowl;
        (4) The year, make, model, color and description of
    	
each vehicle, junk vehicle or vehicle cowl disposed of by such person;
        (5) The manufacturer's vehicle identification number,
    	
Secretary of State identification number or Illinois Department of State Police number, for each vehicle, junk vehicle or vehicle cowl part disposed of by such person;
        (6) The printed name and legible signature of the
    	
person or agent disposing of the vehicle, junk vehicle or vehicle cowl; and
        (7) The printed name and legible signature of the
    	
person accepting delivery of the vehicle, junk vehicle or vehicle cowl.
    The Secretary of State may certify a junking manifest in a form prescribed by the Secretary of State that reflects those vehicles for which junking certificates have been applied or issued. A junking manifest may be issued to any person and it shall constitute evidence of ownership for the vehicle listed upon it. A junking manifest may be transferred only to a person licensed under Section 5-301 of this Code as a scrap processor. A junking manifest will allow the transportation of those vehicles to a scrap processor prior to receiving the junk certificate from the Secretary of State.
    (b) An application for a salvage certificate shall be submitted to the Secretary of State in any of the following situations:
        (1) When an insurance company makes a payment of
    	
damages on a total loss claim for a vehicle, the insurance company shall be deemed to be the owner of such vehicle and the vehicle shall be considered to be salvage except that ownership of (i) a vehicle that has incurred only hail damage that does not affect the operational safety of the vehicle or (ii) any vehicle 9 model years of age or older may, by agreement between the registered owner and the insurance company, be retained by the registered owner of such vehicle. The insurance company shall promptly deliver or mail within 20 days the certificate of title along with proper application and fee to the Secretary of State, and a salvage certificate shall be issued in the name of the insurance company. Notwithstanding the foregoing, an insurer making payment of damages on a total loss claim for the theft of a vehicle shall not be required to apply for a salvage certificate unless the vehicle is recovered and has incurred damage that initially would have caused the vehicle to be declared a total loss by the insurer.
        (1.1) When a vehicle of a self-insured company is to
    	
be sold in the State of Illinois and has sustained damaged by collision, fire, theft, rust corrosion, or other means so that the self-insured company determines the vehicle to be a total loss, or if the cost of repairing the damage, including labor, would be greater than 70% of its fair market value without that damage, the vehicle shall be considered salvage. The self-insured company shall promptly deliver the certificate of title along with proper application and fee to the Secretary of State, and a salvage certificate shall be issued in the name of the self-insured company. A self-insured company making payment of damages on a total loss claim for the theft of a vehicle may exchange the salvage certificate for a certificate of title if the vehicle is recovered without damage. In such a situation, the self-insured shall fill out and sign a form prescribed by the Secretary of State which contains an affirmation under penalty of perjury that the vehicle was recovered without damage and the Secretary of State may, by rule, require photographs to be submitted.
        (2) When a vehicle the ownership of which has been
    	
transferred to any person through a certificate of purchase from acquisition of the vehicle at an auction, other dispositions as set forth in Sections 4-208 and 4-209 of this Code, or a lien arising under Section 18a-501 of this Code shall be deemed salvage or junk at the option of the purchaser. The person acquiring such vehicle in such manner shall promptly deliver or mail, within 20 days after the acquisition of the vehicle, the certificate of purchase, the proper application and fee, and, if the vehicle is an abandoned mobile home under the Abandoned Mobile Home Act, a certification from a local law enforcement agency that the vehicle was purchased or acquired at a public sale under the Abandoned Mobile Home Act to the Secretary of State and a salvage certificate or junking certificate shall be issued in the name of that person. The salvage certificate or junking certificate issued by the Secretary of State under this Section shall be free of any lien that existed against the vehicle prior to the time the vehicle was acquired by the applicant under this Code.
        (3) A vehicle which has been repossessed by a
    	
lienholder shall be considered to be salvage only when the repossessed vehicle, on the date of repossession by the lienholder, has sustained damage by collision, fire, theft, rust corrosion, or other means so that the cost of repairing such damage, including labor, would be greater than 33 1/3% of its fair market value without such damage. If the lienholder determines that such vehicle is damaged in excess of 33 1/3% of such fair market value, the lienholder shall, before sale, transfer or assignment of the vehicle, make application for a salvage certificate, and shall submit with such application the proper fee and evidence of possession. If the facts required to be shown in subsection (f) of Section 3-114 are satisfied, the Secretary of State shall issue a salvage certificate in the name of the lienholder making the application. In any case wherein the vehicle repossessed is not damaged in excess of 33 1/3% of its fair market value, the lienholder shall comply with the requirements of subsections (f), (f-5), and (f-10) of Section 3-114, except that the affidavit of repossession made by or on behalf of the lienholder shall also contain an affirmation under penalty of perjury that the vehicle on the date of sale is not damaged in excess of 33 1/3% of its fair market value. If the facts required to be shown in subsection (f) of Section 3-114 are satisfied, the Secretary of State shall issue a certificate of title as set forth in Section 3-116 of this Code. The Secretary of State may by rule or regulation require photographs to be submitted.
        (4) A vehicle which is a part of a fleet of more than
    	
5 commercial vehicles registered in this State or any other state or registered proportionately among several states shall be considered to be salvage when such vehicle has sustained damage by collision, fire, theft, rust, corrosion or similar means so that the cost of repairing such damage, including labor, would be greater than 33 1/3% of the fair market value of the vehicle without such damage. If the owner of a fleet vehicle desires to sell, transfer, or assign his interest in such vehicle to a person within this State other than an insurance company licensed to do business within this State, and the owner determines that such vehicle, at the time of the proposed sale, transfer or assignment is damaged in excess of 33 1/3% of its fair market value, the owner shall, before such sale, transfer or assignment, make application for a salvage certificate. The application shall contain with it evidence of possession of the vehicle. If the fleet vehicle at the time of its sale, transfer, or assignment is not damaged in excess of 33 1/3% of its fair market value, the owner shall so state in a written affirmation on a form prescribed by the Secretary of State by rule or regulation. The Secretary of State may by rule or regulation require photographs to be submitted. Upon sale, transfer or assignment of the fleet vehicle the owner shall mail the affirmation to the Secretary of State.
        (5) A vehicle that has been submerged in water to the
    	
point that rising water has reached over the door sill and has entered the passenger or trunk compartment is a "flood vehicle". A flood vehicle shall be considered to be salvage only if the vehicle has sustained damage so that the cost of repairing the damage, including labor, would be greater than 33 1/3% of the fair market value of the vehicle without that damage. The salvage certificate issued under this Section shall indicate the word "flood", and the word "flood" shall be conspicuously entered on subsequent titles for the vehicle. A person who possesses or acquires a flood vehicle that is not damaged in excess of 33 1/3% of its fair market value shall make application for title in accordance with Section 3-116 of this Code, designating the vehicle as "flood" in a manner prescribed by the Secretary of State. The certificate of title issued shall indicate the word "flood", and the word "flood" shall be conspicuously entered on subsequent titles for the vehicle.
        (6) When any licensed rebuilder, repairer, new or
    	
used vehicle dealer, or remittance agent has submitted an application for title to a vehicle (other than an application for title to a rebuilt vehicle) that he or she knows or reasonably should have known to have sustained damages in excess of 33 1/3% of the vehicle's fair market value without that damage; provided, however, that any application for a salvage certificate for a vehicle recovered from theft and acquired from an insurance company shall be made as required by paragraph (1) of this subsection (b).
    (c) Any person who without authority acquires, sells, exchanges, gives away, transfers or destroys or offers to acquire, sell, exchange, give away, transfer or destroy the certificate of title to any vehicle which is a junk or salvage vehicle shall be guilty of a Class 3 felony.
    (d) Except as provided under subsection (a), any person who knowingly fails to surrender to the Secretary of State a certificate of title, salvage certificate, certificate of purchase or a similarly acceptable out-of-state document of ownership as required under the provisions of this Section is guilty of a Class A misdemeanor for a first offense and a Class 4 felony for a subsequent offense; except that a person licensed under this Code who violates paragraph (5) of subsection (b) of this Section is guilty of a business offense and shall be fined not less than $1,000 nor more than $5,000 for a first offense and is guilty of a Class 4 felony for a second or subsequent violation.
    (e) Any vehicle which is salvage or junk may not be driven or operated on roads and highways within this State. A violation of this subsection is a Class A misdemeanor. A salvage vehicle displaying valid special plates issued under Section 3-601(b) of this Code, which is being driven to or from an inspection conducted under Section 3-308 of this Code, is exempt from the provisions of this subsection. A salvage vehicle for which a short term permit has been issued under Section 3-307 of this Code is exempt from the provisions of this subsection for the duration of the permit.

    This subsection (b) shall apply only to a motor vehicle titled in this State that has been through an insurance claims process and the owner of the vehicle or lienholder, if applicable, has received compensation in exchange for relinquishing the ownership rights of the vehicle to an insurance company licensed under the Illinois Insurance Code and the insurance company is unable to obtain an endorsed certificate of title within 30 days of payment to the owner or lienholder.
    (c) Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, a salvage dealer may, after completing a record search for any owner of a vehicle or a lienholder of record, obtain free of any lien a junking certificate or salvage certificate in his or her name by submitting an application for a junking certificate or a salvage certificate to the Secretary of State which shall include, but is not limited to, proof of notice via certified mail or other proof of service to the vehicle owner or any lienholder that a transfer of title shall occur no earlier than 30 days after the date the notice is sent.

    (a) A lien given by statute or rule of law to a supplier of services or materials for the vehicle;
    (b) A lien given by statute to the United States, this State or any political subdivision of this State, except liens on trailer coaches and mobile homes for public assistance, as provided in Section 3-12 (now repealed) of the Illinois Public Aid Code.

    (625 ILCS 5/3-202) (from Ch. 95 1/2, par. 3-202)
    Sec. 3-202. Perfection of security interest.
    (a) Unless excepted by Section 3-201, a security interest in a vehicle of a type for which a certificate of title is required is not valid against subsequent transferees or lienholders of the vehicle unless perfected as provided in this Act. A purchase money security interest in a manufactured home is perfected against the rights of judicial lien creditors and execution creditors on and after the date such purchase money security interest attaches.
    (b) A security interest is perfected by the delivery to the Secretary of State of the existing certificate of title, if any, an application for a certificate of title containing the name and address of the lienholder and the required fee. The security interest is perfected as of the time of its creation if the delivery to the Secretary of State is completed within 30 days after the creation of the security interest or receipt by the new lienholder of the existing certificate of title from a prior lienholder or licensed dealer, otherwise as of the time of the delivery.
    (c) If a vehicle is subject to a security interest when brought into this State, the validity of the security interest is determined by the law of the jurisdiction where the vehicle was when the security interest attached, subject to the following:
        1. If the parties understood at the time the security
    	
interest attached that the vehicle would be kept in this State and it was brought into this State within 30 days thereafter for purposes other than transportation through this State, the validity of the security interest in this State is determined by the law of this State.
        2. If the security interest was perfected under the
    	
law of the jurisdiction where the vehicle was when the security interest attached, the following rules apply:
            (A) If the name of the lienholder is shown on an
        	
existing certificate of title issued by that jurisdiction, his security interest continues perfected in this State.
            (B) If the name of the lienholder is not shown on
        	
an existing certificate of title issued by that jurisdiction, a security interest may be perfected by the lienholder delivering to the Secretary of State the prescribed notice and by payment of the required fee. Such security interest is perfected as of the time of delivery of the prescribed notice and payment of the required fee.
        3. If the security interest was not perfected under
    	
the law of the jurisdiction where the vehicle was when the security interest attached, it may be perfected in this State; in that case perfection dates from the time of perfection in this State.
        4. A security interest may be perfected under
    	
paragraph 3 of this subsection either as provided in subsection (b) or by the lienholder delivering to the Secretary of State a notice of security interest in the form the Secretary of State prescribes and the required fee.
    (d) Except as otherwise provided in Sections 3-116.1, 3-116.2, 3-207, and the Conveyance and Encumbrance of Manufactured Homes as Real Property and Severance Act, after a certificate of title has been issued for a manufactured home and as long as the manufactured home is subject to any security interest perfected pursuant to this Section, the Secretary of State shall not file an affidavit of affixation, nor cancel the Manufacturer's Statement of Origin, nor revoke the certificate of title, nor issue a certificate of title under Section 3-106, and, in any event, the validity and priority of any security interest perfected pursuant to this Section shall continue, notwithstanding the provision of any other law.

    (b) The lienholder shall immediately cause the certificate, application and the required fee to be mailed or delivered to the Secretary of State.

If the payment is in the form of cash, a cashier's check, or a certified check, the number of days is reduced to 10 business days. If the owner desires a new certificate reflecting no lien, the certificate and release from the lienholder may be submitted to the Secretary of State, along with the prescribed application and required fee, for issuance of that new certificate.
    (b) Within 21 days after receiving payment to satisfy a security interest in a vehicle for which the certificate of title is in the possession of a prior lienholder, the lienholder whose security interest is satisfied shall execute a release and deliver the release to the owner or any person who delivers to the lienholder an authorization from the owner to receive it. If the payment is in the form of cash, a cashier's check, or a certified check, the number of days is reduced to 10 business days. The lienholder in possession of the certificate of title may either deliver the certificate to the owner, or the person authorized by him, for delivery to the Secretary of State, or, upon receipt of the release, may mail or may deliver the certificate and release, along with prescribed application and require fee, to the Secretary of State, who shall issue a new certificate.
    (c) In addition to any other penalty, a lienholder who fails to execute a release of his or her security interest or who fails to mail or deliver the certificate and release within the time limit provided in subsection (a) or (b) is liable to the person or entity that was supposed to receive the release or certificate for $150 plus reasonable attorney fees and court costs. An action under this Section may be brought in small claims court or in any other appropriate court.
    (d) The holder of a security interest in or a lien on a manufactured home may deliver lien release documents to any person to facilitate conveying or encumbering the manufactured home. Any person receiving any such documents so delivered holds the documents in trust for the security interest holder or the lienholder.

    Sec. 3-400. Definitions. Notwithstanding the definitions set forth in Chapter 1 of this Act, for the purposes of this Article, the following words shall have the meaning ascribed to them as follows:
    "Apportionable Fee" means any periodic recurring fee required for licensing or registering vehicles, such as, but not limited to, registration fees, license or weight fees.
    "Apportionable Vehicle" means any vehicle, except recreational vehicles, vehicles displaying restricted plates, city pickup and delivery vehicles, buses used in transportation of chartered parties, and government owned vehicles that are used or intended for use in 2 or more member jurisdictions that allocate or proportionally register vehicles, in a fleet which is used for the transportation of persons for hire or the transportation of property and which has a gross vehicle weight in excess of 26,000 pounds; or has three or more axles regardless of weight; or is used in combination when the weight of such combination exceeds 26,000 pounds gross vehicle weight. Vehicles, or combinations having a gross vehicle weight of 26,000 pounds or less and two-axle vehicles may be proportionally registered at the option of such owner.
    "Base Jurisdiction" means, for purposes of fleet registration, the jurisdiction where the registrant has an established place of business, where operational records of the fleet are maintained and where mileage is accrued by the fleet. In case a registrant operates more than one fleet, and maintains records for each fleet in different places, the "base jurisdiction" for a fleet shall be the jurisdiction where an established place of business is maintained, where records of the operation of that fleet are maintained and where mileage is accrued by that fleet.
    "Operational Records" means documents supporting miles traveled in each jurisdiction and total miles traveled, such as fuel reports, trip leases, and logs.
    "Owner" means a person who holds legal title of a motor vehicle, or in the event a motor vehicle is the subject of an agreement for the conditional sale or lease thereof with the right of purchase upon performance of the conditions stated in the agreement and with an immediate right of possession vested in the conditional vendee or lessee with right of purchase, or in the event a mortgagor of such motor vehicle is entitled to possession, or in the event a lessee of such motor vehicle is entitled to possession or control, then such conditional vendee or lessee with right of purchase or mortgagor or lessee is considered to be the owner for the purpose of this Act.
    "Registration plate or digital registration plate cover" means any tinted, colored, painted, marked, clear, or illuminated object that is designed to (i) cover any of the characters of a motor vehicle's registration plate or digital registration plate; or (ii) distort a recorded image of any of the characters of a motor vehicle's registration plate or digital registration plate recorded by an automated enforcement system as defined in Section 11-208.6, 11-208.8, or 11-1201.1 of this Code or recorded by an automated traffic control system as defined in Section 15 of the Automated Traffic Control Systems in Highway Construction or Maintenance Zones Act.
    "Rental Owner" means an owner principally engaged, with respect to one or more rental fleets, in renting to others or offering for rental the vehicles of such fleets, without drivers.
    "Restricted Plates" shall include, but is not limited to, dealer, manufacturer, transporter, farm, repossessor, and permanently mounted type plates. Vehicles displaying any of these type plates from a foreign jurisdiction that is a member of the International Registration Plan shall be granted reciprocity but shall be subject to the same limitations as similar plated Illinois registered vehicles.

    (625 ILCS 5/3-401) (from Ch. 95 1/2, par. 3-401)
    Sec. 3-401. Effect of provisions.
    (a) It shall be unlawful for any person to violate any provision of this Chapter or to drive or move or for an owner knowingly to permit to be driven or moved upon any highway any vehicle of a type required to be registered hereunder which is not registered or for which the appropriate fee has not been paid when and as required hereunder, except that when application accompanied by proper fee has been made for registration of a vehicle it may be operated temporarily pending complete registration upon displaying a duplicate application duly verified or other evidence of such application or otherwise under rules and regulations promulgated by the Secretary of State.
    (b) The appropriate fees required to be paid under the various provisions of this Act for registration of vehicles shall mean the fee or fees which would have been paid initially, if proper and timely application had been made to the Secretary of State for the appropriate registration required, whether such registration be a flat weight registration, a single trip permit, a reciprocity permit or a supplemental application to an original prorate application together with payment of fees due under the supplemental application for prorate decals.
    (c) Effective October 1, 1984, no vehicle required to pay a Federal Highway Users Tax shall be registered unless proof of payment, in a form prescribed and approved by the Secretary of State, is submitted with the appropriate registration. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Code, failure of the applicant to comply with this paragraph shall be deemed grounds for the Secretary to refuse registration.
    (c-1) A vehicle may not be registered by the Secretary of State unless that vehicle:
        (1) was originally manufactured for operation on
    	
highways;
        (2) is a modification of a vehicle that was
    	
originally manufactured for operation on highways; or
        (3) was assembled from component parts designed for
    	
use in vehicles to be operated on highways.
    (d) Second division vehicles.
        (1) A vehicle of the second division moved or
    	
operated within this State shall have had paid for it the appropriate registration fees and flat weight tax, as evidenced by the Illinois registration issued for that vehicle, for the gross weight of the vehicle and load being operated or moved within this State. Second division vehicles of foreign jurisdictions operated within this State under a single trip permit, fleet reciprocity plan, prorate registration plan, or apportional registration plan, instead of second division vehicle registration under Article VIII of this Chapter, must have had paid for it the appropriate registration fees and flat weight tax in the base jurisdiction of that vehicle, as evidenced by the maximum gross weight shown on the foreign registration cards, plus any appropriate fees required under this Code.
        (2) If a vehicle and load are operated in this State
    	
and the appropriate fees and taxes have not been paid or the vehicle and load exceed the registered gross weight for which the required fees and taxes have been paid by 2001 pounds or more, the operator or owner shall be fined as provided in Section 15-113 of this Code. However, an owner or operator shall not be subject to arrest under this subsection for any weight in excess of 80,000 pounds. Further, no fine shall exceed the actual cost of what the appropriate registration for that vehicle and load should have been as established in subsection (a) of Section 3-815 of this Chapter regardless of the route traveled. For purposes of this paragraph (2), "appropriate registration" means the full annual cost of the required registration and its associated fees.
        (3) Any person operating a legal combination of
    	
vehicles displaying valid registration shall not be considered in violation of the registration provision of this subsection unless the total gross weight of the combination exceeds the total licensed weight of the vehicles in the combination. The gross weight of a vehicle exempt from the registration requirements of this Chapter shall not be included when determining the total gross weight of vehicles in combination. Any vehicle operating under an emergency harvest permit, as described in subsection (e-1) of Section 15-301 of this Code, shall not be in violation of this paragraph (3).
        (4) If the defendant claims that he or she had
    	
previously paid the appropriate Illinois registration fees and taxes for this vehicle before the alleged violation, the defendant shall have the burden of proving the existence of the payment by competent evidence. Proof of proper Illinois registration issued by the Secretary of State, or the appropriate registration authority from the foreign state, shall be the only competent evidence of payment.

    Sec. 3-401.5. Digital registration plates and renewals.
    (a) The Secretary of State may authorize the issuance of a digital registration plate to a vehicle, in lieu of a set of static, metal registration plates, if the vehicle owner separately purchases the digital registration plate for a particular vehicle. The Secretary shall consult with law enforcement agencies when considering whether to approve the design of a digital license plate. The display device must allow for the automated image capture of letters and numbers during daytime and nighttime, including when the vehicle is parked or turned off. The Secretary shall work with the vehicle owner and the distributor of the digital registration plates to coordinate the appropriate plate image and registration expiration to appear on the digital registration plate. One metal plate shall still be issued to the vehicle owner for the front end of the vehicle.
    (b) The Secretary, for any vehicle owner that purchases a digital registration plate, may electronically renew the digital registration plate upon receiving the appropriate renewal registration fee as set forth in this Code. The Secretary may also authorize the image to be suspended or revoked and replaced with an alternative image or blank screen upon violation of any provision of this Code or the failure to renew the digital registration plate.
    (c) Before a digital registration plate may be issued in lieu of a special plate authorized under Article VI of this Chapter, the Secretary shall seek approval from the originating organization, when possible, to authorize a digital version of the static, metal plates issued to a vehicle owner.
    (d) The owner of a digital registration plate is responsible for any costs associated with using the digital registration plate, including, but not limited to, the initial purchase price and any replacement costs.
    (e) The Secretary of State may adopt any rules necessary to implement and develop a digital registration plate program, including rules regarding the images that may appear on digital registration plates.
    (f) No image shall appear on a digital registration plate without prior approval of the Secretary of State.

    B. Reciprocity. Any motor vehicle, trailer, semitrailer or pole trailer need not be registered under this Code provided the same is operated interstate and in accordance with the following provisions and any rules and regulations promulgated pursuant thereto:
        (1) A nonresident owner, except as otherwise provided
    	
in this Section, owning any foreign registered vehicle of a type otherwise subject to registration hereunder, may operate or permit the operation of such vehicle within this State in interstate commerce without registering such vehicle in, or paying any fees to, this State subject to the condition that such vehicle at all times when operated in this State is operated pursuant to a reciprocity agreement, arrangement or declaration by this State, and further subject to the condition that such vehicle at all times when operated in this State is duly registered in, and displays upon it, a valid registration card and registration plate or plates or digital registration plate or plates issued for such vehicle in the place of residence of such owner and is issued and maintains in such vehicle a valid Illinois reciprocity permit as required by the Secretary of State, and provided like privileges are afforded to residents of this State by the State of residence of such owner.
        Every nonresident including any foreign corporation
    	
carrying on business within this State and owning and regularly operating in such business any motor vehicle, trailer or semitrailer within this State in intrastate commerce, shall be required to register each such vehicle and pay the same fees therefor as is required with reference to like vehicles owned by residents of this State.
        (2) Any motor vehicle, trailer, semitrailer and pole
    	
trailer operated interstate need not be registered in this State, provided:
            (a) that the vehicle is properly registered in
        	
another State pursuant to law or to a reciprocity agreement, arrangement or declaration; or
            (b) that such vehicle is part of a fleet of
        	
vehicles owned or operated by the same person who registers such fleet of vehicles pro rata among the various States in which such fleet operates; or
            (c) that such vehicle is part of a fleet of
        	
vehicles, a portion of which are registered with the Secretary of State of Illinois in accordance with an agreement or arrangement concurred in by the Secretary of State of Illinois based on one or more of the following factors: ratio of miles in Illinois as against total miles in all jurisdictions; situs or base of a vehicle, or where it is principally garaged, or from whence it is principally dispatched or where the movements of such vehicle usually originate; situs of the residence of the owner or operator thereof, or of his principal office or offices, or of his places of business; the routes traversed and whether regular or irregular routes are traversed, and the jurisdictions traversed and served; and such other factors as may be deemed material by the Secretary and the motor vehicle administrators of the other jurisdictions involved in such apportionment. Such vehicles shall maintain therein any reciprocity permit which may be required by the Secretary of State pursuant to rules and regulations which the Secretary of State may promulgate in the administration of this Code, in the public interest.
        (3)(a) In order to effectuate the purposes of this
    	
Code, the Secretary of State of Illinois is empowered to negotiate and execute written reciprocal agreements or arrangements with the duly authorized representatives of other jurisdictions, including States, districts, territories and possessions of the United States, and foreign states, provinces, or countries, granting to owners or operators of vehicles duly registered or licensed in such other jurisdictions and for which evidence of compliance is supplied, benefits, privileges and exemption from the payment, wholly or partially, of any taxes, fees or other charges imposed with respect to the ownership or operation of such vehicles by the laws of this State except the tax imposed by the Motor Fuel Tax Law, approved March 25, 1929, as amended, and the tax imposed by the Use Tax Act, approved July 14, 1955, as amended.
        The Secretary of State may negotiate agreements or
    	
arrangements as are in the best interests of this State and the residents of this State pursuant to the policies expressed in this Section taking into consideration the reciprocal exemptions, benefits and privileges available and accruing to residents of this State and vehicles registered in this State.
        (b) Such reciprocal agreements or arrangements shall
    	
provide that vehicles duly registered or licensed in this State when operated upon the highways of such other jurisdictions, shall receive exemptions, benefits and privileges of a similar kind or to a similar degree as extended to vehicles from such jurisdictions in this State.
        (c) Such agreements or arrangements may also
    	
authorize the apportionment of registration or licensing of fleets of vehicles operated interstate, based on any or all of the following factors: ratio of miles in Illinois as against total miles in all jurisdictions; situs or base of a vehicle, or where it is principally garaged or from whence it is principally dispatched or where the movements of such vehicle usually originate; situs of the residence of the owner or operator thereof, or of his principal office or offices, or of his places of business; the routes traversed and whether regular or irregular routes are traversed, and the jurisdictions traversed and served; and such other factors as may be deemed material by the Secretary and the motor vehicle administrators of the other jurisdictions involved in such apportionment, and such vehicles shall likewise be entitled to reciprocal exemptions, benefits and privileges.
        (d) Such agreements or arrangements shall also
    	
provide that vehicles being operated in intrastate commerce in Illinois shall comply with the registration and licensing laws of this State, except that vehicles which are part of an apportioned fleet may conduct an intrastate operation incidental to their interstate operations. Any motor vehicle properly registered and qualified under any reciprocal agreement or arrangement under this Code and not having a situs or base within Illinois may complete the inbound movement of a trailer or semitrailer to an Illinois destination that was brought into Illinois by a motor vehicle also properly registered and qualified under this Code and not having a situs or base within Illinois, or may complete an outbound movement of a trailer or semitrailer to an out-of-state destination that was originated in Illinois by a motor vehicle also properly registered and qualified under this Code and not having a situs or base in Illinois, only if the operator thereof did not break bulk of the cargo laden in such inbound or outbound trailer or semitrailer. Adding or unloading intrastate cargo on such inbound or outbound trailer or semitrailer shall be deemed as breaking bulk.
        (e) Such agreements or arrangements may also provide
    	
for the determination of the proper State in which leased vehicles shall be registered based on the factors set out in subsection (c) above and for apportionment of registration of fleets of leased vehicles by the lessee or by the lessor who leases such vehicles to persons who are not fleet operators.
        (f) Such agreements or arrangements may also include
    	
reciprocal exemptions, benefits or privileges accruing under The Illinois Driver Licensing Law or The Driver License Compact.
        (4) The Secretary of State is further authorized to
    	
examine the laws and requirements of other jurisdictions, and, in the absence of a written agreement or arrangement, to issue a written declaration of the extent and nature of the exemptions, benefits and privileges accorded to vehicles of this State by such other jurisdictions, and the extent and nature of reciprocal exemptions, benefits and privileges thereby accorded by this State to the vehicles of such other jurisdictions. A declaration by the Secretary of State may include any, part or all reciprocal exemptions, benefits and privileges or provisions as may be included within an agreement or arrangement.
        (5) All agreements, arrangements, declarations and
    	
amendments thereto, shall be in writing and become effective when signed by the Secretary of State, and copies of all such documents shall be available to the public upon request.
        (6) The Secretary of State is further authorized to
    	
require the display by foreign registered trucks, truck-tractors and buses, entitled to reciprocal benefits, exemptions or privileges hereunder, a reciprocity permit for external display before any such reciprocal benefits, exemptions or privileges are granted. The Secretary of State shall provide suitable application forms for such permit and shall promulgate and publish reasonable rules and regulations for the administration and enforcement of the provisions of this Code including a provision for revocation of such permit as to any vehicle operated wilfully in violation of the terms of any reciprocal agreement, arrangement or declaration or in violation of the Illinois Motor Carrier of Property Law, as amended.
        (7)(a) Upon the suspension, revocation or denial of
    	
one or more of all reciprocal benefits, privileges and exemptions existing pursuant to the terms and provisions of this Code or by virtue of a reciprocal agreement or arrangement or declaration thereunder; or, upon the suspension, revocation or denial of a reciprocity permit; or, upon any action or inaction of the Secretary in the administration and enforcement of the provisions of this Code, any person, resident or nonresident, so aggrieved, may serve upon the Secretary, a petition in writing and under oath, setting forth the grievance of the petitioner, the grounds and basis for the relief sought, and all necessary facts and particulars, and request an administrative hearing thereon. Within 20 days, the Secretary shall set a hearing date as early as practical. The Secretary may, in his discretion, supply forms for such a petition. The Secretary may require the payment of a fee of not more than $50 for the filing of any petition, motion, or request for hearing conducted pursuant to this Section. These fees must be deposited into the Secretary of State DUI Administration Fund, a special fund that is hereby created in the State treasury, and, subject to appropriation and as directed by the Secretary of State, shall be used to fund the operation of the hearings department of the Office of the Secretary of State and for no other purpose. The Secretary shall establish by rule the amount and the procedures, terms, and conditions relating to these fees.
        (b) The Secretary may likewise, in his discretion and
    	
upon his own petition, order a hearing, when in his best judgment, any person is not entitled to the reciprocal benefits, privileges and exemptions existing pursuant to the terms and provisions of this Code or under a reciprocal agreement or arrangement or declaration thereunder or that a vehicle owned or operated by such person is improperly registered or licensed, or that an Illinois resident has improperly registered or licensed a vehicle in another jurisdiction for the purposes of violating or avoiding the registration laws of this State.
        (c) The Secretary shall notify a petitioner or any
    	
other person involved of such a hearing, by giving at least 10 days notice, in writing, by U.S. Mail, Registered or Certified, or by personal service, at the last known address of such petitioner or person, specifying the time and place of such hearing. Such hearing shall be held before the Secretary, or any person as he may designate, and unless the parties mutually agree to some other county in Illinois, the hearing shall be held in the County of Sangamon or the County of Cook. Appropriate records of the hearing shall be kept, and the Secretary shall issue or cause to be issued, his decision on the case, within 30 days after the close of such hearing or within 30 days after receipt of the transcript thereof, and a copy shall likewise be served or mailed to the petitioner or person involved.
        (d) The actions or inactions or determinations, or
    	
findings and decisions upon an administrative hearing, of the Secretary, shall be subject to judicial review in the Circuit Court of the County of Sangamon or the County of Cook, and the provisions of the Administrative Review Law, and all amendments and modifications thereof and rules adopted pursuant thereto, apply to and govern all such reviewable matters.
        Any reciprocal agreements or arrangements entered
    	
into by the Secretary of State or any declarations issued by the Secretary of State pursuant to any law in effect prior to the effective date of this Code are not hereby abrogated, and such shall continue in force and effect until amended pursuant to the provisions of this Code or expire pursuant to the terms or provisions thereof.

    (625 ILCS 5/3-402.1) (from Ch. 95 1/2, par. 3-402.1)
    Sec. 3-402.1. Proportional registration. Any owner or rental owner engaged in operating a fleet of apportionable vehicles in this State and one or more other states may, in lieu of registration of such vehicles under the general provisions of Sections 3-402, 3-815, 3-815.1, and 3-819, register and license such fleet for operations in this State by filing an application statement, signed under penalties of perjury, with the Secretary of State which shall be in such form and contain such information as the Secretary of State shall require, declaring the total mileage operated in all states by such fleet, the total mileage operated in this state by such fleet during the preceding year, and describing and identifying each apportionable vehicle to be operated in this State during the ensuing year. If mileage data is not available for the preceding year, the Secretary of State may accept the latest 12-month period available. "Preceding year" means the period of 12 consecutive months immediately prior to July 1st of the year immediately preceding the registration or license year for which proportional registration is sought.
    Such owner shall determine the proportion of in-state miles to total fleet miles. Such percentage figure shall be such owner's apportionment factor. In determining the total fee payment, such owner shall first compute the license fee or fees for each vehicle within the fleet which would otherwise be required, and then multiply the said amount by the Illinois apportionment factor adding the fees for each vehicle to arrive at a total amount for the fleet. Apportionable trailers and semitrailers will be registered in accordance with the provisions of Section 3-813 of this Code.
    Upon receipt of the appropriate fees from such owner as computed under the provisions of this Section, the Secretary of State shall, when this State is the base jurisdiction, issue to such owner number plates or other distinctive tags or such evidence of registration as the Secretary of State shall deem appropriate to identify each vehicle in the fleet as a part of a proportionally registered interstate fleet.
    Vehicles registered under the provision of this Section shall be considered fully licensed and properly registered in Illinois for any type of movement or operation.

required by the Secretary to enable him to determine whether the vehicle is lawfully entitled to registration and the owner entitled to a certificate of title.
        5. An affirmation by the applicant that all
    	
information set forth is true and correct. If the application is for the registration of a motor vehicle, the applicant also shall affirm that the motor vehicle is insured as required by this Code, that such insurance will be maintained throughout the period for which the motor vehicle shall be registered, and that neither the owner, nor any person operating the motor vehicle with the owner's permission, shall operate the motor vehicle unless the required insurance is in effect. If the person signing the affirmation is not the sole owner of the vehicle, such person shall be deemed to have affirmed on behalf of all the owners of the vehicle. If the person signing the affirmation is not an owner of the vehicle, such person shall be deemed to have affirmed on behalf of the owner or owners of the vehicle. The lack of signature on the application shall not in any manner exempt the owner or owners from any provisions, requirements or penalties of this Code.
    (b) When such application refers to a new vehicle purchased from a dealer the application shall be accompanied by a Manufacturer's Statement of Origin from the dealer, and a statement showing any lien retained by the dealer.

    (625 ILCS 5/3-600) (from Ch. 95 1/2, par. 3-600)
    Sec. 3-600. Requirements for issuance of special plates.
    (a) The Secretary of State shall issue only special plates that have been authorized by the General Assembly. Except as provided in subsection (a-5), the Secretary of State shall not issue a series of special plates, or Universal special plates associated with an organization authorized to issue decals for Universal special plates, unless applications, as prescribed by the Secretary, have been received for 2,000 plates of that series. Where a special plate is authorized by law to raise funds for a specific civic group, charitable entity, or other identified organization, or when the civic group, charitable entity, or organization is authorized to issue decals for Universal special license plates, and where the Secretary of State has not received the required number of applications to issue that special plate within 2 years of the effective date of the Public Act authorizing the special plate or decal, the Secretary of State's authority to issue the special plate or a Universal special plate associated with that decal is nullified. All applications for special plates shall be on a form designated by the Secretary and shall be accompanied by any civic group's, charitable entity's, or other identified fundraising organization's portion of the additional fee associated with that plate or decal. All fees collected under this Section are non-refundable and shall be deposited in the special fund as designated in the enabling legislation, regardless of whether the plate or decal is produced. Upon the adoption of this amendatory Act of the 99th General Assembly, no further special license plates shall be authorized by the General Assembly unless that special license plate is authorized under subsection (a-5) of this Section.
    (a-5) If the General Assembly authorizes the issuance of a special plate that recognizes the applicant's military service or receipt of a military medal or award, the Secretary may immediately begin issuing that special plate.
    (b) The Secretary of State, upon issuing a new series of special license plates, shall notify all law enforcement officials of the design, color and other special features of the special license plate series.
    (c) This Section shall not apply to the Secretary of State's discretion as established in Section 3-611.
    (d) If a law authorizing a special license plate provides that the sponsoring organization is to designate a charitable entity as the recipient of the funds from the sale of that license plate, the designated charitable entity must be in compliance with the registration and reporting requirements of the Charitable Trust Act and the Solicitation for Charity Act. In addition, the charitable entity must annually provide the Secretary of State's office a letter of compliance issued by the Illinois Attorney General's office verifying the entity is in compliance with the Acts.
    In the case of a law in effect before the effective date of this amendatory Act of the 97th General Assembly, the name of the charitable entity which is to receive the funds shall be provided to the Secretary of State within one year after the effective date of this amendatory Act of the 97th General Assembly. In the case of a law that takes effect on or after the effective date of this amendatory Act of the 97th General Assembly, the name of the charitable entity which is to receive the funds shall be provided to the Secretary of State within one year after the law takes effect. If the organization fails to designate an appropriate charitable entity within the one-year period, or if the designated charitable entity fails to annually provide the Secretary of State a letter of compliance issued by the Illinois Attorney General's office, any funds collected from the sale of plates authorized for that organization and not previously disbursed shall be transferred to the General Revenue Fund, and the special plates shall be discontinued.
    (e) If fewer than 1,000 sets of any special license plate authorized by law and issued by the Secretary of State are actively registered for 2 consecutive calendar years, the Secretary of State may discontinue the issuance of that special license plate or require that special license plate to be exchanged for Universal special plates with appropriate decals.
    (f) Where special license plates have been discontinued pursuant to subsection (d) or (e) of this Section, or when the special license plates are required to be exchanged for Universal special plates under subsection (e) of this Section, all previously issued plates of that type shall be recalled. Owners of vehicles which were registered with recalled plates shall not be charged a reclassification or registration sticker replacement plate fee upon the issuance of new plates for those vehicles.
    (g) Any special plate that is authorized to be issued for motorcycles may also be issued for autocycles.
    (h) The Secretary may use alternating numeric and alphabetical characters when issuing a special registration plate authorized under this Chapter.
    (i) The Secretary of State may issue digital registration plates and stickers in accordance with this Section and Section 3-401.5.

    (a) In addition to any other special license plate, the Secretary, upon receipt of all applicable fees and applications made in the form prescribed by the Secretary, may issue Universal special license plates to residents of Illinois on behalf of organizations that have been authorized by the General Assembly to issue decals for Universal special license plates. Appropriate documentation, as determined by the Secretary, shall accompany each application. Authorized organizations shall be designated by amendment to this Section. When applying for a Universal special license plate the applicant shall inform the Secretary of the name of the authorized organization from which the applicant will obtain a decal to place on the plate. The Secretary shall make a record of that organization and that organization shall remain affiliated with that plate until the plate is surrendered, revoked, or otherwise cancelled. The authorized organization may charge a fee to offset the cost of producing and distributing the decal, but that fee shall be retained by the authorized organization and shall be separate and distinct from any registration fees charged by the Secretary. No decal, sticker, or other material may be affixed to a Universal special license plate other than a decal authorized by the General Assembly in this Section or a registration renewal sticker. The special plates issued under this Section shall be affixed only to passenger vehicles of the first division, including motorcycles and autocycles, or motor vehicles of the second division weighing not more than 8,000 pounds. Plates issued under this Section shall expire according to the multi-year procedure under Section 3-414.1 of this Code.

    (c) When authorizing a Universal special license plate, the General Assembly shall set forth whether an additional fee is to be charged for the plate and, if a fee is to be charged, the amount of the fee and how the fee is to be distributed. When necessary, the authorizing language shall create a special fund in the State treasury into which fees may be deposited for an authorized Universal special license plate. Additional fees may only be charged if the fee is to be paid over to a State agency or to a charitable entity that is in compliance with the registration and reporting requirements of the Charitable Trust Act and the Solicitation for Charity Act. Any charitable entity receiving fees for the sale of Universal special license plates shall annually provide the Secretary of State a letter of compliance issued by the Attorney General verifying that the entity is in compliance with the Charitable Trust Act and the Solicitation for Charity Act.
    (d) Upon original issuance and for each registration renewal period, in addition to the appropriate registration fee, if applicable, the Secretary shall collect any additional fees, if required, for issuance of Universal special license plates.

All fees collected shall be transferred to the State agency on whose behalf the fees were collected, or paid into the special fund designated in the law authorizing the organization to issue decals for Universal special license plates.

    Sec. 3-704.1. Municipal vehicle tax liability; suspension of registration.
    (a) As used in this Section:
        (1) "Municipality" means a city, village or
    	
incorporated town with a population over 1,000,000.
        (2) "Vehicle tax" means a motor vehicle tax and any

    (b) A municipality that imposes a vehicle tax may, by ordinance adopted under this Section, establish a system whereby the municipality notifies the Secretary of State of vehicle tax liability and the Secretary of State suspends the registration of vehicles for which the tax has not been paid. An ordinance establishing a system must provide for the following:
        (1) A first notice for failure to pay a vehicle tax
    	
shall be sent by first class mail to the vehicle owner at the owner's address recorded with the Secretary of State whenever the municipality has reasonable cause to believe that the vehicle owner has failed to pay a vehicle tax as required by ordinance. The notice shall include at least the following:
            (A) The name and address of the vehicle owner.
            (B) The registration plate or digital

            (F) An explanation of the vehicle owner's
        	
opportunity to be heard under subsection (c).
        (2) If a vehicle owner fails to pay the vehicle tax
    	
or to contest successfully the owner's alleged liability within the period specified in the first notice, a second notice of impending registration suspension shall be sent by first class mail to the vehicle owner at the owner's address recorded with the Secretary of State. The notice shall contain the same information as the first notice, but shall also state that the failure to pay the amount owing, or to contest successfully the alleged liability within 45 days of the date of the second notice, will result in the municipality's notification of the Secretary of State that the vehicle owner is eligible for initiation of suspension proceedings under this Section.
    (c) An ordinance adopted under this Section must also give the vehicle owner an opportunity to be heard upon the filing of a timely petition with the municipality. A vehicle owner may contest the alleged tax liability either through an adjudication by mail or at an administrative hearing, at the option of the vehicle owner.

plate or digital registration plate number of the vehicle of the person who failed to pay the vehicle tax.
        (2) The name of the municipality making the report.
        (3) A statement that the municipality sent notices as
    	
required by subsection (b); the date on which the notices were sent; the address to which the notices were sent; and the date of the hearing, if any.
    (f) Following receipt of the certified report under this Section, the Secretary of State shall notify the vehicle owner that the vehicle's registration will be suspended at the end of a reasonable specified period of time unless the Secretary of State is presented with a notice from the municipality certifying that the person has paid the necessary vehicle tax, or that inclusion of that person's name or registration number on the certified report was in error. The Secretary's notice shall state in substance the information contained in the certified report from the municipality to the Secretary, and shall be effective as specified by subsection (c) of Section 6-211 of this Code. The notice shall also inform the person of the person's right to a hearing under subsection (g).
    (g) An administrative hearing with the Office of the Secretary of State to contest an impending suspension or a suspension made under this Section may be had upon filing a written request with the Secretary of State. The filing fee for this hearing shall be $20 to be paid at the time the request is made.

official of the municipality was certified and contained the information required by this Section.
            (B) Whether the municipality making the certified
        	
report to the Secretary of State established procedures by ordinance for persons to challenge the accuracy of the certified report.
            (C) Whether the Secretary of State notified the
        	
vehicle owner that the vehicle's registration would be suspended at the end of the specified time period unless the Secretary of State was presented with a notice from the municipality certifying that the person has purchased the necessary vehicle tax sticker or that inclusion of that person's name or registration number on the certified report was in error.
    A municipality that files a certified report with the Secretary of State under this Section shall reimburse the Secretary for all reasonable costs incurred by the Secretary as a result of the filing of the report, including but not limited to the costs of providing the notice required under subsection (f) and the costs incurred by the Secretary in any hearing conducted with respect to the report under this subsection and any appeal from that hearing.
    (h) After the expiration of the time specified under subsection (g), the Secretary of State shall, unless the suspension is successfully contested, suspend the registration of the vehicle until the Secretary receives notice under subsection (i).
    (i) Any municipality making a certified report to the Secretary of State under this subsection shall notify the Secretary of State, in a form prescribed by the Secretary, whenever a person named in the certified report has subsequently paid a vehicle tax or whenever the municipality determines that the original report was in error. A certified copy of the notification shall also be given upon request and at no additional charge to the person named in the report. Upon receipt of the notification or presentation of a certified copy of the notification by the municipality, the Secretary of State shall terminate the suspension.
    (j) To facilitate enforcement of municipal vehicle tax liability, a municipality may provide by ordinance for a program of vehicle immobilization as provided by Section 11-1430.1 of this Code.

    If registered in the first year the owner shall have the option of paying $30 the first year and the remaining $30 by the start of the second year;
    If registered in the second year the owner shall have the option of paying $24 the first year and the remaining $24 by the start of the third year;
    If registered in the third year the owner shall pay $36 for each semitrailer;
    If registered in the fourth year the owner shall pay $24 for each semitrailer; and
    If registered in the fifth year the owner shall pay $12 for each semitrailer.
Every such owner who elects to pay such tax in such installments shall file with the Secretary of State a surety bond or certificate of deposit, as hereinafter provided, in the amount of the sum of the second installment of taxes on his vehicle.
    Such bond shall be in the form approved by the Secretary of State and with a surety company approved by the Department of Insurance to transact business in this State, as surety, and shall be conditioned upon such owner's paying to the State of Illinois all monies becoming due by reason of his operation of the second division motor vehicle in this State, together with all penalties and interest thereon.
    The State Treasurer shall issue a certificate of deposit to any such owner who deposits with the State Treasurer securities of the Federal Government or the State of Illinois endorsed in blank by such owner, or a certificate of deposit issued by any bank or savings and loan association authorized to do business in Illinois, payable to the Secretary of State on or after July 1 of the year of registration. Such certificate of deposit and securities shall be approved by and deposited with the State Treasurer, and shall have a current market value in the total amount which would cover all monies becoming due and payable to the State of Illinois by reason of his operation of a second division motor vehicle in this State, together with all penalties and interest thereon.
    The liability of the surety hereunder shall be absolute and upon notice from the Secretary of State that the second installment has not been paid on July 1 of any licensing year the surety shall immediately pay the second installment to the Secretary of State.
    Upon notice by the Secretary of State that the second installment of such owner's taxes has not been paid on July 1 of any licensing year, the State Treasurer shall sell such securities and deliver the proceeds thereof to the Secretary of State to satisfy all monies becoming due by reason of such owner's operation of a second division motor vehicle in this State, together with all penalties and interest thereon.
    If the owner's liability for the second installment is evidenced by a certificate of deposit payable to the Secretary of State, the Secretary of State shall, upon failure of the owner to pay the second installment by July 1, endorse the certificate of deposit which is in the custody of the State Treasurer, and thereafter the State Treasurer shall present the certificate of deposit for payment to the proper bank or savings and loan association. Upon receipt of payment, the State Treasurer shall forward to the Secretary of State all monies due by reason of such owner's operation of a second division motor vehicle in this State, and return the excess, if any, to the owner on whose behalf the certificate of deposit was previously deposited.
    The State Treasurer shall return securities or proceeds in excess of that needed to satisfy the Secretary of State for all monies becoming due by reason of such owner's operation of a second division motor vehicle in this State, together with all penalties and interest thereon. Upon notice by the Secretary of State that the second installment has been paid, the State Treasurer shall return such certificate of deposit or securities deposited with him under this Section to the owner thereof.
    (b) The flat weight tax required by Section 3-815 to be paid on a fiscal year basis may be paid, if the owner so elects, in equal semi-annual installments due on July 1st and January 1st of each registration year. From July 1, 1983 through November 30, 1983, the flat weight tax required by Section 3-814 for semitrailers previously registered on a fiscal year basis may be paid, if the owner so elects, by paying the Secretary of State $33 at the time of registration and the remaining $25 by January 1, 1985 for each 5 1/2 year semitrailer plate. Every such owner who elects to pay such tax in such installments shall file with the Secretary of State a surety bond or certificate of deposit, as hereinafter provided, in the amount of the sum of the second installment of taxes on his vehicle.
    Such bond shall be in the form approved by the Secretary of State and with a surety company approved by the Department of Insurance to transact business in this State, as surety, and shall be conditioned upon such owner's paying to the State of Illinois all monies becoming due by reason of his operation of the second division motor vehicle in this State, together with all penalties and interest thereon.
    The liability of the surety hereunder shall be absolute and upon notice from the Secretary of State that the second installment has not been paid on January 1st of any registration year the surety shall immediately pay the second installment to the Secretary of State.
    Upon notice by the Secretary of State that the second installment of such owner's taxes has not been paid on January 1st of any registration year, the State Treasurer shall sell such securities and deliver the proceeds thereof to the Secretary of State to satisfy all monies becoming due by reason of such owner's operation of a second division motor vehicle in this State, together with all penalties and interest thereon.
    If the owner's liability for the second installment is evidenced by a certificate of deposit payable to the Secretary of State, the Secretary of State shall, upon failure of the owner to pay the second installment by January 1st, endorse the certificate of deposit which is in the custody of the State Treasurer, and thereafter the State Treasurer shall present the certificate of deposit for payment to the proper bank or savings and loan association. Upon receipt of payment, the State Treasurer shall forward to the Secretary of State all monies due by reason of such owner's operation of a second division motor vehicle in this State, and return the excess, if any, to the owner on whose behalf the certificate of deposit was previously deposited.
    The State Treasurer shall return securities or proceeds in excess of that needed to satisfy the Secretary of State for all monies becoming due by reason of such owner's operation of a second division motor vehicle in this State, together with all penalties and interest thereon. Upon notice by the Secretary of State that the second installment has been paid, the State Treasurer shall return such certificate of deposit or securities deposited with him under this Section to the owner thereof.
    (c) The flat weight tax required under Section 3-815 for vehicles registered in accordance with Section 3-402.1 may be paid, if the owner elects, in equal semi-annual installments due on April 1 and October 1 of each licensing year.
    (d) In the event any surety pays for any second installment under this Section, the surety shall have recourse only against the principal and owner of the vehicles involved and shall have no right or privilege to demand revocation or suspension of the registration plates or registration stickers of the vehicles involved. Such surety may, however, impress a lien as provided in Section 3-828.

The Secretary shall designate this class of vehicle as a Special Hauling Vehicle.
    In preparing rate schedules on registration applications, the Secretary of State shall add to the above rates, the $10 registration fee. The Secretary may decline to accept any renewal filed after July 1st.
    The number of axles necessary to carry the maximum load provided shall be determined from Chapter 15 of this Code.
    Every owner of a second division motor vehicle for which he has elected to pay a mileage weight tax shall keep a daily record upon forms prescribed by the Secretary of State, showing the mileage covered by that vehicle in this State. Such record shall contain the license number of the vehicle and the miles traveled by the vehicle in this State for each day of the calendar month. Such owner shall also maintain records of fuel consumed by each such motor vehicle and fuel purchases therefor. On or before the 10th day of July the owner shall certify to the Secretary of State upon forms prescribed therefor, summaries of his daily records which shall show the miles traveled by the vehicle in this State during the preceding 12 months and such other information as the Secretary of State may require. The daily record and fuel records shall be filed, preserved and available for audit for a period of 3 years. Any owner filing a return hereunder shall certify that such return is a true, correct and complete return. Any person who willfully makes a false return hereunder is guilty of perjury and shall be punished in the same manner and to the same extent as is provided therefor.
    At the time of filing his return, each owner shall pay to the Secretary of State the proper amount of tax at the rate herein imposed.
    Every owner of a vehicle of the second division who elects to pay on a mileage weight tax basis and who operates the vehicle within this State, shall file with the Secretary of State a bond in the amount of $500.

The $10 surcharge is to identify vehicles in the 12,000 lbs. and less mileage weight plate category as a covered farm vehicle. The $10 surcharge is an annual flat fee that shall be based on an applicant's new or existing registration year for each vehicle in the 12,000 lbs. and less mileage weight plate category. A designation as a covered farm vehicle under this subsection (b) shall not alter a vehicle's registration as a registration in the 12,000 lbs. or less mileage weight category.

    If the total amount then due and owing exceeds the sum of $100 and has not been paid in full within 60 days from the date the dishonored payment was first delivered to the Secretary of State, the Secretary of State shall assess a penalty of 25% of such amount remaining unpaid.
    All amounts payable under this Section shall be computed to the nearest dollar. Out of each fee collected for dishonored payments, $5 shall be deposited in the Secretary of State Special Services Fund.
    (d) The minimum fee and tax to be paid by any applicant for apportionment of a fleet of vehicles under this Code shall be $15 if the application was filed on or before the date specified by the Secretary together with fees and taxes due.

    Sec. 3-821.2. Delinquent registration renewal fee.
    (a) For registration renewal periods beginning on or after January 1, 2005, the Secretary of State may impose a delinquent registration renewal fee of $20 for the registration renewal of all passenger vehicles of the first division and motor vehicles of the second division weighing not more than 8,000 pounds if the application for registration renewal is received by the Secretary more than one month after the expiration of the most recent period during which the vehicle was registered. If a delinquent registration renewal fee is imposed, the Secretary shall not renew the registration of such a vehicle until the delinquent registration renewal fee has been paid, in addition to any other registration fees owed for the vehicle. Active duty military personnel stationed outside of Illinois shall not be required to pay the delinquent registration renewal fee. If a delinquent registration renewal fee is imposed, the Secretary shall adopt rules for the implementation of this Section. All fees collected under this Section shall be deposited into the General Revenue Fund.
    (b) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (a), the Secretary of State shall not impose a delinquent registration renewal fee for the registration renewal of passenger vehicles of the first division and motor vehicles of the second division weighing not more than 8,000 pounds if a vehicle's registration expires during a period of time in which the Secretary is not sending registration renewal notices to owners of all of those vehicles with registration expiring at the same time as the applicable vehicle. It shall be an affirmative defense to a citation for an expired registration issued by any local, county, municipal, or State law enforcement agency within one month after the expiration of vehicle registration, that the expiration occurred during a period of time in which the Secretary was not sending registration renewal notices to owners of all passenger vehicles of the first division and motor vehicles of the second division weighing not more than 8,000 pounds with registration expiring at the same time as the applicable vehicle. A computer print-out of a page from the Secretary of State's official website setting forth the calendar months in which registration renewal notices were not sent to all owners of passenger vehicles of the first division and motor vehicles of the second division weighing not more than 8,000 pounds shall be admissible as evidence to establish the affirmative defense. The computer print-out shall be prima facie evidence of the correctness of the information contained in it. The changes made by this amendatory Act of the 99th General Assembly apply only to vehicle registrations that expire on or after the effective date of this amendatory Act of the 99th General Assembly.
    The provisions of this subsection (b), other than this sentence, are inoperative on and after June 30, 2017.

    (b) Whenever the Secretary of State collects any fee not required to be paid under the provisions of this Act, the same shall be refunded to the person paying the same upon application therefor made within 6 months after the date of such payment, except as follows: (1) whenever a refund is determined to be due and owing as a result of an audit, by this State or any other state or province, in accordance with Section 2-124 of this Code, of a prorate or apportion license fee payment pursuant to any reciprocal compact or agreement between this State and any other state or province, and the Secretary for any reason fails to promptly make such refund, the licensee shall have one year from the date of the notification of the audit result to file, with the Secretary, an application for refund found to be due and owing as a result of such audit; and (2) whenever a person eligible for a reduced registration fee pursuant to Section 3-806.3 of this Code has paid in excess of the reduced registration fee owed, the refund applicant shall have 2 years from the date of overpayment to apply with the Secretary for a refund of that part of payment made in excess of the established reduced registration fee.
    (c) Whenever a person dies after making application for registration, application for a refund of the registration fees and taxes may be made if the vehicle is then sold or disposed of so that the registration plates or digital registration plates, registration sticker or digital registration sticker and card are never used. The Secretary of State shall refund the registration fees and taxes upon receipt within 6 months after the application for registration of an application for refund accompanied with the unused registration plates or digital registration plates or registration sticker or digital registration sticker and card and proof of both the death of the applicant and the sale or disposition of the vehicle.

    (d-5) Refunds may be granted for any title-related transaction if a title application has not been processed by the Secretary of State.

    (e) The Secretary of State is authorized to maintain a two signature revolving checking account with a suitable commercial bank for the purpose of depositing and withdrawal-for-return those monies received and determined upon receipt to be in excess of the amount or amounts required by law.

    Any vehicle used in violation of the provision of this Act shall be subject to a lien for the full amount of all unpaid registration fees, flat weight taxes, and penalties. Such lien shall not release the offender from the full payment of all such fees, taxes, penalties and damages. The lien shall attach at the time of operation of any such vehicle within this State and shall remain effective until all unpaid registration fees, flat weight taxes, penalties and audit fees are paid, or until the vehicle is sold for the payment thereof. Such liens shall be superior to any other lien except that:
    (a) no lien for any amounts due or assessed pursuant to this Section shall be enforceable against any vehicle which prior to such assessment had been transferred in good faith to a bona fide transferee for value;
    (b) the lien of any amounts due or assessed shall be subject to a prior lien of any indebtedness existing against such vehicle which is noted on the certificate of title of such vehicle issued under this Act, or as to a vehicle from another jurisdiction, if written notice thereof is filed with the Secretary of State before such lien becomes operative and if
    (1) Such prior indebtedness was incurred in good faith to secure all or a portion of the purchase price of such vehicle, and
    (2) Such prior indebtedness is secured by a chattel mortgage or conditional sales agreement duly filed or perfected in this State pursuant to law and such chattel mortgage or conditional sales was not given directly or indirectly, to any officer, director or shareholder of a corporation, or to a partner of a partnership, or to a trustee or beneficiary of a trust, owning or having the lawful use or control of such vehicle, whether as a purchase money mortgage or otherwise.
    The lien imposed under this Section shall be enforceable as to any equity after the encumbrance of any such chattel mortgage or conditional sales contract, and in the event any such vehicle subject to a lien hereunder is repossessed by a chattel mortgagee or a conditional vendor, such vehicle shall not be sold at any public or private sale unless at least 5 days written notice by registered mail is served upon the Secretary of State.
    The Secretary of State, upon perfecting a prior lien hereunder for any flat weight taxes required to be paid under Section 3-815 may in his discretion waive the requirement for the surety bond specified in Section 3-816, providing that the said prior lien is so noted on the certificate of title for such vehicle or vehicles.
    Any surety making payment of a second installment of taxes under Section 3-816 of this Act, may impress a lien similar to that of the Secretary of State, and such lien may be noted on title records and documents. The surety shall, however, pay any statutory fees therefor.

    (625 ILCS 5/4-107) (from Ch. 95 1/2, par. 4-107)
    Sec. 4-107. Stolen, converted, recovered and unclaimed vehicles.
    (a) Every Sheriff, Superintendent of police, Chief of police or other police officer in command of any Police department in any City, Village or Town of the State, shall, by the fastest means of communications available to his law enforcement agency, immediately report to the State Police, in Springfield, Illinois, the theft or recovery of any stolen or converted vehicle within his district or jurisdiction. The report shall give the date of theft, description of the vehicle including color, year of manufacture, manufacturer's trade name, manufacturer's series name, body style, vehicle identification number and license registration number, including the state in which the license was issued and the year of issuance, together with the name, residence address, business address, and telephone number of the owner. The report shall be routed by the originating law enforcement agency through the State Police District in which such agency is located.
    (b) A registered owner or a lienholder may report the theft by conversion of a vehicle, to the State Police, or any other police department or Sheriff's office. Such report will be accepted as a report of theft and processed only if a formal complaint is on file and a warrant issued.
    (c) An operator of a place of business for garaging, repairing, parking or storing vehicles for the public, in which a vehicle remains unclaimed, after being left for the purpose of garaging, repairing, parking or storage, for a period of 15 days, shall, within 5 days after the expiration of that period, report the vehicle as unclaimed to the municipal police when the vehicle is within the corporate limits of any City, Village or incorporated Town, or the County Sheriff, or State Police when the vehicle is outside the corporate limits of a City, Village or incorporated Town. This Section does not apply to any vehicle:
        (1) removed to a place of storage by a law
    	
enforcement agency having jurisdiction, in accordance with Sections 4-201 and 4-203 of this Act; or
        (2) left under a garaging, repairing, parking, or
    	
storage order signed by the owner, lessor, or other legally entitled person.
    Failure to comply with this Section will result in the forfeiture of storage fees for that vehicle involved.
    (d) The State Police shall keep a complete record of all reports filed under this Section of the Act. Upon receipt of such report, a careful search shall be made of the records of the office of the State Police, and where it is found that a vehicle reported recovered was stolen in a County, City, Village or Town other than the County, City, Village or Town in which it is recovered, the State Police shall immediately notify the Sheriff, Superintendent of police, Chief of police, or other police officer in command of the Sheriff's office or Police department of the County, City, Village or Town in which the vehicle was originally reported stolen, giving complete data as to the time and place of recovery.
    (e) Notification of the theft or conversion of a vehicle will be furnished to the Secretary of State by the State Police. The Secretary of State shall place the proper information in the license registration and title registration files to indicate the theft or conversion of a motor vehicle or other vehicle. Notification of the recovery of a vehicle previously reported as a theft or a conversion will be furnished to the Secretary of State by the State Police. The Secretary of State shall remove the proper information from the license registration and title registration files that has previously indicated the theft or conversion of a vehicle. The Secretary of State shall suspend the registration of a vehicle upon receipt of a report from the State Police that such vehicle was stolen or converted.
    (f) When the Secretary of State receives an application for a certificate of title or an application for registration of a vehicle and it is determined from the records of the office of the Secretary of State that such vehicle has been reported stolen or converted, the Secretary of State shall immediately notify the State Police or the Secretary of State Department of Police and shall give the State Police or the Secretary of State Department of Police the name and address of the person or firm titling or registering the vehicle, together with all other information contained in the application submitted by such person or firm. If the Secretary of State Department of Police receives notification under this subsection (f), it shall conduct an investigation concerning the identity of the registered owner of the stolen or converted vehicle.
    (g) During the usual course of business the manufacturer of any vehicle shall place an original manufacturer's vehicle identification number on all such vehicles manufactured and on any part of such vehicles requiring an identification number.
    (h) Except provided in subsection (h-1), if a manufacturer's vehicle identification number is missing or has been removed, changed or mutilated on any vehicle, or any part of such vehicle requiring an identification number, the State Police or the Secretary of State Department of Police shall restore, restamp or reaffix the vehicle identification number plate, or affix a new plate bearing the original manufacturer's vehicle identification number on each such vehicle and on all necessary parts of the vehicles. A vehicle identification number so affixed, restored, restamped, reaffixed or replaced is not falsified, altered or forged within the meaning of this Act.
    (h-1) A person engaged in the repair or servicing of vehicles may reaffix a manufacturer's identification number plate on the same damaged vehicle from which it was originally removed, if the person reaffixes the original manufacturer's identification number plate in place of the identification number plate affixed on a new dashboard that has been installed in the vehicle. The person must notify the Secretary of State each time the original manufacturer's identification number plate is reaffixed on a vehicle. The person must keep a record indicating that the identification number plate affixed on the new dashboard has been removed and has been replaced by the manufacturer's identification number plate originally affixed on the vehicle. The person also must keep a record regarding the status and location of the identification number plate removed from the replacement dashboard. The Secretary shall adopt rules for implementing this subsection (h-1).
    (h-2) The owner of a vehicle repaired under subsection (h-1) must, within 90 days of the date of the repairs, contact an officer of the Illinois State Police Vehicle Inspection Bureau and arrange for an inspection of the vehicle, by the officer or the officer's designee, at a mutually agreed upon date and location.
    (i) If a vehicle or part of any vehicle is found to have the manufacturer's identification number removed, altered, defaced or destroyed, the vehicle or part shall be seized by any law enforcement agency having jurisdiction and held for the purpose of identification. In the event that the manufacturer's identification number of a vehicle or part cannot be identified, the vehicle or part shall be considered contraband, and no right of property shall exist in any person owning, leasing or possessing such property, unless the person owning, leasing or possessing the vehicle or part acquired such without knowledge that the manufacturer's vehicle identification number has been removed, altered, defaced, falsified or destroyed.
    Either the seizing law enforcement agency or the State's Attorney of the county where the seizure occurred may make an application for an order of forfeiture to the circuit court in the county of seizure. The application for forfeiture shall be independent from any prosecution arising out of the seizure and is not subject to any final determination of such prosecution. The circuit court shall issue an order forfeiting the property to the seizing law enforcement agency if the court finds that the property did not at the time of seizure possess a valid manufacturer's identification number and that the original manufacturer's identification number cannot be ascertained. The seizing law enforcement agency may:
        (1) retain the forfeited property for official use; or
        (2) sell the forfeited property and distribute the
    	
proceeds in accordance with Section 4-211 of this Code, or dispose of the forfeited property in such manner as the law enforcement agency deems appropriate.
    (i-1) If a motorcycle is seized under subsection (i), the motorcycle must be returned within 45 days of the date of seizure to the person from whom it was seized, unless (i) criminal charges are pending against that person or (ii) an application for an order of forfeiture has been submitted to the circuit in the county of seizure or (iii) the circuit court in the county of seizure has received from the seizing law enforcement agency and has granted a petition to extend, for a single 30 day period, the 45 days allowed for return of the motorcycle. Except as provided in subsection (i-2), a motorcycle returned to the person from whom it was seized must be returned in essentially the same condition it was in at the time of seizure.
    (i-2) If any part or parts of a motorcycle seized under subsection (i) are found to be stolen and are removed, the seizing law enforcement agency is not required to replace the part or parts before returning the motorcycle to the person from whom it was seized.
    (j) The State Police or the Secretary of State Department of Police shall notify the Secretary of State each time a manufacturer's vehicle identification number is affixed, reaffixed, restored or restamped on any vehicle. The Secretary of State shall make the necessary changes or corrections in his records, after the proper applications and fees have been submitted, if applicable.
    (k) Any vessel, vehicle or aircraft used with knowledge and consent of the owner in the commission of, or in the attempt to commit as defined in Section 8-4 of the Criminal Code of 2012, an offense prohibited by Section 4-103 of this Chapter, including transporting of a stolen vehicle or stolen vehicle parts, shall be seized by any law enforcement agency. The seizing law enforcement agency may:
        (1) return the vehicle to its owner if such vehicle
    	
is stolen; or
        (2) confiscate the vehicle and retain it for any
    	
purpose which the law enforcement agency deems appropriate; or
        (3) sell the vehicle at a public sale or dispose of
    	
the vehicle in such other manner as the law enforcement agency deems appropriate.
    If the vehicle is sold at public sale, the proceeds of the sale shall be paid to the law enforcement agency.
    The law enforcement agency shall not retain, sell or dispose of a vehicle under paragraphs (2) or (3) of this subsection (k) except upon an order of forfeiture issued by the circuit court. The circuit court may issue such order of forfeiture upon application of the law enforcement agency or State's Attorney of the county where the law enforcement agency has jurisdiction, or in the case of the Department of State Police or the Secretary of State, upon application of the Attorney General.
    The court shall issue the order if the owner of the vehicle has been convicted of transporting stolen vehicles or stolen vehicle parts and the evidence establishes that the owner's vehicle has been used in the commission of such offense.
    The provisions of subsection (k) of this Section shall not apply to any vessel, vehicle or aircraft, which has been leased, rented or loaned by its owner, if the owner did not have knowledge of and consent to the use of the vessel, vehicle or aircraft in the commission of, or in an attempt to commit, an offense prohibited by Section 4-103 of this Chapter.

    (e) Whenever a peace officer reasonably believes that a person under arrest for a violation of Section 11-501 of this Code or a similar provision of a local ordinance is likely, upon release, to commit a subsequent violation of Section 11-501, or a similar provision of a local ordinance, the arresting officer shall have the vehicle which the person was operating at the time of the arrest impounded for a period of 12 hours after the time of arrest.

The towing or removal of any vehicle from private property without the consent of the registered owner or other legally authorized person in control of the vehicle is subject to compliance with the following conditions and restrictions:
        1. Any towed or removed vehicle must be stored at the

        2. The towing service shall within 30 minutes of
    	
completion of such towing or removal, notify the law enforcement agency having jurisdiction of such towing or removal, and the make, model, color and license plate number of the vehicle, and shall obtain and record the name of the person at the law enforcement agency to whom such information was reported.
        3. If the registered owner or legally authorized
    	
person entitled to possession of the vehicle shall arrive at the scene prior to actual removal or towing of the vehicle, the vehicle shall be disconnected from the tow truck and that person shall be allowed to remove the vehicle without interference, upon the payment of a reasonable service fee of not more than one half the posted rate of the towing service as provided in paragraph 6 of this subsection, for which a receipt shall be given.
        4. The rebate or payment of money or any other
    	
valuable consideration from the towing service or its owners, managers or employees to the owners or operators of the premises from which the vehicles are towed or removed, for the privilege of removing or towing those vehicles, is prohibited. Any individual who violates this paragraph shall be guilty of a Class A misdemeanor.
        5. Except for property appurtenant to and obviously a
    	
part of a single family residence, and except for instances where notice is personally given to the owner or other legally authorized person in control of the vehicle that the area in which that vehicle is parked is reserved or otherwise unavailable to unauthorized vehicles and they are subject to being removed at the owner or operator's expense, any property owner or lessor, prior to towing or removing any vehicle from private property without the consent of the owner or other legally authorized person in control of that vehicle, must post a notice meeting the following requirements:
            a. Except as otherwise provided in subparagraph
        	
a.1 of this subdivision (f)5, the notice must be prominently placed at each driveway access or curb cut allowing vehicular access to the property within 5 feet from the public right-of-way line. If there are no curbs or access barriers, the sign must be posted not less than one sign each 100 feet of lot frontage.
            a.1. In a municipality with a population of less
        	
than 250,000, as an alternative to the requirement of subparagraph a of this subdivision (f)5, the notice for a parking lot contained within property used solely for a 2-family, 3-family, or 4-family residence may be prominently placed at the perimeter of the parking lot, in a position where the notice is visible to the occupants of vehicles entering the lot.
            b. The notice must indicate clearly, in not less
        	
than 2 inch high light-reflective letters on a contrasting background, that unauthorized vehicles will be towed away at the owner's expense.
            c. The notice must also provide the name and
        	
current telephone number of the towing service towing or removing the vehicle.
            d. The sign structure containing the required
        	
notices must be permanently installed with the bottom of the sign not less than 4 feet above ground level, and must be continuously maintained on the property for not less than 24 hours prior to the towing or removing of any vehicle.
        6. Any towing service that tows or removes vehicles
    	
and proposes to require the owner, operator, or person in control of the vehicle to pay the costs of towing and storage prior to redemption of the vehicle must file and keep on record with the local law enforcement agency a complete copy of the current rates to be charged for such services, and post at the storage site an identical rate schedule and any written contracts with property owners, lessors, or persons in control of property which authorize them to remove vehicles as provided in this Section. The towing and storage charges, however, shall not exceed the maximum allowed by the Illinois Commerce Commission under Section 18a-200.
        7. No person shall engage in the removal of vehicles
    	
from private property as described in this Section without filing a notice of intent in each community where he intends to do such removal, and such notice shall be filed at least 7 days before commencing such towing.
        8. No removal of a vehicle from private property
    	
shall be done except upon express written instructions of the owners or persons in charge of the private property upon which the vehicle is said to be trespassing.
        9. Vehicle entry for the purpose of removal shall be
    	
allowed with reasonable care on the part of the person or firm towing the vehicle. Such person or firm shall be liable for any damages occasioned to the vehicle if such entry is not in accordance with the standards of reasonable care.
        9.5. Except as authorized by a law enforcement

        10. When a vehicle has been towed or removed pursuant
    	
to this Section, it must be released to its owner, custodian, agent, or lienholder within one half hour after requested, if such request is made during business hours. Any vehicle owner, custodian, agent, or lienholder shall have the right to inspect the vehicle before accepting its return, and no release or waiver of any kind which would release the towing service from liability for damages incurred during the towing and storage may be required from any vehicle owner or other legally authorized person as a condition of release of the vehicle. A detailed, signed receipt showing the legal name of the towing service must be given to the person paying towing or storage charges at the time of payment, whether requested or not.
        This Section shall not apply to law enforcement,
    	
firefighting, rescue, ambulance, or other emergency vehicles which are marked as such or to property owned by any governmental entity.
        When an authorized person improperly causes a motor
    	
vehicle to be removed, such person shall be liable to the owner or lessee of the vehicle for the cost or removal, transportation and storage, any damages resulting from the removal, transportation and storage, attorney's fee and court costs.
        Any towing or storage charges accrued shall be
    	
payable in cash or by cashier's check, certified check, debit card, credit card, or wire transfer, at the option of the party taking possession of the vehicle.
        11. Towing companies shall also provide insurance
    	
coverage for areas where vehicles towed under the provisions of this Chapter will be impounded or otherwise stored, and shall adequately cover loss by fire, theft or other risks.
    Any person who fails to comply with the conditions and restrictions of this subsection shall be guilty of a Class C misdemeanor and shall be fined not less than $100 nor more than $500.
    (g)(1) When a vehicle is determined to be a hazardous dilapidated motor vehicle pursuant to Section 11-40-3.1 of the Illinois Municipal Code or Section 5-12002.1 of the Counties Code, its removal and impoundment by a towing service may be authorized by a law enforcement agency with appropriate jurisdiction.
    (2) When a vehicle removal from either public or private property is authorized by a law enforcement agency, the owner of the vehicle shall be responsible for all towing and storage charges.
    (3) Vehicles removed from public or private property and stored by a commercial vehicle relocator or any other towing service authorized by a law enforcement agency in compliance with this Section and Sections 4-201 and 4-202 of this Code, or at the request of the vehicle owner or operator, shall be subject to a possessor lien for services pursuant to the Labor and Storage Lien (Small Amount) Act. The provisions of Section 1 of that Act relating to notice and implied consent shall be deemed satisfied by compliance with Section 18a-302 and subsection (6) of Section 18a-300. In no event shall such lien be greater than the rate or rates established in accordance with subsection (6) of Section 18a-200 of this Code. In no event shall such lien be increased or altered to reflect any charge for services or materials rendered in addition to those authorized by this Code. Every such lien shall be payable in cash or by cashier's check, certified check, debit card, credit card, or wire transfer, at the option of the party taking possession of the vehicle.
    (4) Any personal property belonging to the vehicle owner in a vehicle subject to a lien under this subsection (g) shall likewise be subject to that lien, excepting only: child restraint systems as defined in Section 4 of the Child Passenger Protection Act and other child booster seats; eyeglasses; food; medicine; perishable property; any operator's licenses; any cash, credit cards, or checks or checkbooks; any wallet, purse, or other property containing any operator's license or other identifying documents or materials, cash, credit cards, checks, or checkbooks; and any personal property belonging to a person other than the vehicle owner if that person provides adequate proof that the personal property belongs to that person. The spouse, child, mother, father, brother, or sister of the vehicle owner may claim personal property excepted under this paragraph (4) if the person claiming the personal property provides the commercial vehicle relocator or towing service with the authorization of the vehicle owner.
    (5) This paragraph (5) applies only in the case of a vehicle that is towed as a result of being involved in an accident. In addition to the personal property excepted under paragraph (4), all other personal property in a vehicle subject to a lien under this subsection (g) is exempt from that lien and may be claimed by the vehicle owner if the vehicle owner provides the commercial vehicle relocator or towing service with proof that the vehicle owner has an insurance policy covering towing and storage fees. The spouse, child, mother, father, brother, or sister of the vehicle owner may claim personal property in a vehicle subject to a lien under this subsection (g) if the person claiming the personal property provides the commercial vehicle relocator or towing service with the authorization of the vehicle owner and proof that the vehicle owner has an insurance policy covering towing and storage fees. The regulation of liens on personal property and exceptions to those liens in the case of vehicles towed as a result of being involved in an accident are exclusive powers and functions of the State. A home rule unit may not regulate liens on personal property and exceptions to those liens in the case of vehicles towed as a result of being involved in an accident. This paragraph (5) is a denial and limitation of home rule powers and functions under subsection (h) of Section 6 of Article VII of the Illinois Constitution.
    (6) No lien under this subsection (g) shall: exceed $2,000 in its total amount; or be increased or altered to reflect any charge for services or materials rendered in addition to those authorized by this Code.
    (h) Whenever a peace officer issues a citation to a driver for a violation of subsection (a) of Section 11-506 of this Code, the arresting officer may have the vehicle which the person was operating at the time of the arrest impounded for a period of 5 days after the time of arrest. An impounding agency shall release a motor vehicle impounded under this subsection (h) to the registered owner of the vehicle under any of the following circumstances:
        (1) If the vehicle is a stolen vehicle; or
        (2) If the person ticketed for a violation of
    	
subsection (a) of Section 11-506 of this Code was not authorized by the registered owner of the vehicle to operate the vehicle at the time of the violation; or
        (3) If the registered owner of the vehicle was
    	
neither the driver nor a passenger in the vehicle at the time of the violation or was unaware that the driver was using the vehicle to engage in street racing; or
        (4) If the legal owner or registered owner of the
    	
vehicle is a rental car agency; or
        (5) If, prior to the expiration of the impoundment
    	
period specified above, the citation is dismissed or the defendant is found not guilty of the offense.
    (i) Except for vehicles exempted under subsection (b) of Section 7-601 of this Code, whenever a law enforcement officer issues a citation to a driver for a violation of Section 3-707 of this Code, and the driver has a prior conviction for a violation of Section 3-707 of this Code in the past 12 months, the arresting officer shall authorize the removal and impoundment of the vehicle by a towing service.

    Sec. 4-203.5. Tow rotation list.
    (a) Each law enforcement agency whose duties include the patrol of highways in this State shall maintain a tow rotation list which shall be used by law enforcement officers authorizing the tow of a vehicle within the jurisdiction of the law enforcement agency. To ensure adequate response time, a law enforcement agency may maintain multiple tow rotation lists, with each tow rotation list covering tows authorized in different geographic locations within the jurisdiction of the law enforcement agency. A towing service may be included on more than one tow rotation list.
    (b) Any towing service operating within the jurisdiction of a law enforcement agency may submit an application in a form and manner prescribed by the law enforcement agency for inclusion on the law enforcement agency's tow rotation list. The towing service does not need to be located within the jurisdiction of the law enforcement agency. To be included on a tow rotation list the towing service must meet the following requirements:
        (1) possess a license permitting the towing service
    	
to operate in every unit of local government in the law enforcement agency's jurisdiction that requires a license for the operation of a towing service;
        (2) if required by the law enforcement agency for
    	
inclusion on that law enforcement agency's tow rotation list, each owner of the towing service and each person operating a vehicle on behalf of the towing service shall submit his or her fingerprints to the Department of State Police in the form and manner prescribed by the Department of State Police. These fingerprints should be transmitted through a live scan fingerprint vendor licensed by the Department of Financial and Professional Regulation. These fingerprints shall be checked against the fingerprint records now and hereafter filed in the Department of State Police and Federal Bureau of Investigation criminal history records databases. The Department of State Police shall charge a fee for conducting the criminal history record check, which shall be deposited in the State Police Services Fund and shall not exceed the actual cost of the State and national criminal history record check. The Department of State Police shall furnish, pursuant to positive identification, all Illinois conviction information to the law enforcement agency maintaining the tow rotation list and shall forward the national criminal history record information to the law enforcement agency maintaining the tow rotation list. A person may not own a towing service or operate a vehicle on behalf of a towing service included on a tow rotation list if that person has been convicted during the 5 years preceding the application of a criminal offense involving one or more of the following:
            (A) bodily injury or attempt to inflict bodily
        	
injury to another person;
            (B) theft of property or attempted theft of
        	
property; or
            (C) sexual assault or attempted sexual assault
        	
of any kind;
        (3) each person operating a vehicle on behalf of
    	
the towing service must be classified for the type of towing operation he or she shall be performing and the vehicle he or she shall be operating;
        (4) possess and maintain the following insurance in
    	
addition to any other insurance required by law:
            (A) comprehensive automobile liability
        	
insurance with a minimum combined single limit coverage of $1,000,000;
            (B) commercial general liability insurance with
        	
limits of not less than $1,000,000 per occurrence, $100,000 minimum garage keepers legal liability insurance, and $100,000 minimum on-hook coverage or cargo insurance; and
            (C) a worker's compensation policy covering
        	
every person operating a tow truck on behalf of the towing service, if required under current law;
        (5) possess a secure parking lot used for
    	
short-term vehicle storage after a vehicle is towed that is open during business hours and is equipped with security features as required by the law enforcement agency;
        (6) utilize only vehicles that possess a valid
    	
vehicle registration, display a valid Illinois license plate in accordance with Section 5-202 of this Code, and comply with the weight requirements of this Code;
        (7) every person operating a towing or recovery
    	
vehicle on behalf of the towing service must have completed a Traffic Incident Management Training Program approved by the Department of Transportation;
        (8) hold a valid authority issued to it by the
    	
Illinois Commerce Commission;
        (9) comply with all other applicable federal,
    	
State, and local laws; and
        (10) comply with any additional requirements the
    	
applicable law enforcement agency deems necessary.
    The law enforcement agency may select which towing services meeting the requirements of this subsection (b) shall be included on a tow rotation list. The law enforcement agency may choose to have only one towing service on its tow rotation list. Complaints regarding the process for inclusion on a tow rotation list or the use of a tow rotation list may be referred in writing to the head of the law enforcement agency administering that tow rotation list. The head of the law enforcement agency shall make the final determination as to which qualified towing services shall be included on a tow rotation list, and shall not be held liable for the exclusion of any towing service from a tow rotation list.
    (c) Whenever a law enforcement officer initiates a tow of a vehicle, the officer shall contact his or her law enforcement agency and inform the agency that a tow has been authorized. The law enforcement agency shall then select a towing service from the law enforcement agency's tow rotation list corresponding to the geographical area where the tow was authorized, and shall contact that towing service directly by phone, computer, or similar means. Towing services shall be contacted in the order listed on the appropriate tow rotation list, at which point the towing service shall be placed at the end of that tow rotation list. In the event a listed towing service is not available, the next listed towing service on that tow rotation list shall be contacted.
    (d) A law enforcement agency may deviate from the order listed on a tow rotation list if the towing service next on that tow rotation list is, in the judgment of the authorizing officer or the law enforcement agency making the selection, incapable of or not properly equipped for handling a specific task related to the tow that requires special skills or equipment. A deviation from the order listed on the tow rotation list for this reason shall not cause a loss of rotation turn by the towing service determined to be incapable or not properly equipped for handling the request.
    (e) In the event of an emergency a law enforcement officer or agency, taking into account the safety and location of the situation, may deviate from the order of the tow rotation list and obtain towing service from any source deemed appropriate.
    (f) If the owner or operator of a disabled vehicle is present at the scene of the disabled vehicle, is not under arrest, and does not abandon his or her vehicle, and in the law enforcement officer's opinion the disabled vehicle is not impeding or obstructing traffic, illegally parked, or posing a security or safety risk, the law enforcement officer shall allow the owner of the vehicle to specify a towing service to relocate the disabled vehicle. If the owner chooses not to specify a towing service, the law enforcement agency shall select a towing service for the vehicle as provided in subsection (c) of this Section.
    (g) If a tow operator is present or arrives where a tow is needed and it has not been requested by the law enforcement agency or the owner or operator, the law enforcement officer, unless acting under Section 11-1431 of this Code, shall advise the tow operator to leave the scene.
    (h) Nothing contained in this Section shall apply to a law enforcement agency having jurisdiction solely over a municipality with a population over 1,000,000.

If applicable law provides that the proceeds are to be paid into the treasury of the appropriate civil jurisdiction, then any unpaid removal, towing, storage, and processing charges and collection costs shall be paid to the towing service from the treasury of the civil jurisdiction. That payment shall not, however, exceed the amount of proceeds from the sale, with the balance to be paid by the owner, operator, or other legally entitled person.
        (d) Upon delivery of a written release order to the
    	
towing service, a vehicle subject to a hold order shall be released to the owner, operator, or other legally entitled person upon proof of ownership or other entitlement and upon payment of applicable removal, towing, storage, and processing charges and collection costs.

    (a) When a law enforcement agency authorizing the impounding of a vehicle does not know the identity of the registered owner, lienholder or other legally entitled person, that law enforcement agency will cause the vehicle registration records of the State of Illinois to be searched by the Secretary of State for the purpose of obtaining the required ownership information.
    (b) The law enforcement agency authorizing the impounding of a vehicle will cause the stolen motor vehicle files of the State Police to be searched by a directed communication to the State Police for stolen or wanted information on the vehicle. When the State Police files are searched with negative results, the information contained in the National Crime Information Center (NCIC) files will be searched by the State Police. The information determined from these record searches will be returned to the requesting law enforcement agency for that agency's use in sending a notification by certified mail to the registered owner, lienholder and other legally entitled persons advising where the vehicle is held, requesting a disposition be made and setting forth public sale information. Notification shall be sent no later than 10 business days after the date the law enforcement agency impounds or authorizes the impounding of a vehicle, provided that if the law enforcement agency is unable to determine the identity of the registered owner, lienholder or other person legally entitled to ownership of the impounded vehicle within a 10 business day period after impoundment, then notification shall be sent no later than 2 days after the date the identity of the registered owner, lienholder or other person legally entitled to ownership of the impounded vehicle is determined. Exceptions to a notification by certified mail to the registered owner, lienholder and other legally entitled persons are set forth in Section 4-209 of this Code.
    (c) When ownership information is needed for a towing service to give notification as required under this Code, the towing service may cause the vehicle registration records of the State of Illinois to be searched by the Secretary of State, and in such case, the towing service also shall give notice to all lienholders of record within the time period required for such other notices.
    The written request of a towing service, in the form and containing the information prescribed by the Secretary of State by rule, may be transmitted to the Secretary of State in person, by U.S. mail or other delivery service, by facsimile transmission, or by other means the Secretary of State deems acceptable.
    The Secretary of State shall provide the required information, or a statement that the information was not found in the vehicle registration records of the State, by U.S. mail or other delivery service, facsimile transmission, as requested by the towing service, or by other means acceptable to the Secretary of State.

    (a) Any commercial vehicle relocator or any other private towing service providing removal or towing services pursuant to this Code and seeking to impose fees in connection with the furnishing of storage for a vehicle in the possession of the commercial vehicle relocator or other private towing service must provide written notice within 2 business days after the vehicle is removed or towed, by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the lienholder of record, regardless of whether the commercial vehicle relocator or other private towing service enforces a lien under the Labor and Storage Lien Act or the Labor and Storage Lien (Small Amount) Act. The notice shall be effective upon mailing and include the rate at which fees will be incurred, and shall provide the lienholder with an opportunity to inspect the vehicle on the premises where the vehicle is stored within 2 business days of the lienholder's request. The date on which the assessment and accrual of storage fees may commence is the date of the impoundment of the vehicle, subject to any applicable limitations set forth by a municipality authorizing the vehicle removal. Payment of the storage fees by the lienholder may be made in cash or by cashier's check, certified check, debit card, credit card, or wire transfer, at the option of the lienholder taking possession of the vehicle. The commercial vehicle relocator or other private towing service shall furnish a copy of the certified mail receipt to the lienholder upon request.
    (b) The notification requirements in subsection (a) of this Section apply in addition to any lienholder notice requirements under this Code relating to the removal or towing of an abandoned, lost, stolen, or unclaimed vehicle.

    (c) If the notification required under subsection (a) was not sent and a lienholder discovers its collateral is in the possession of a commercial vehicle relocator or other private towing service by means other than the notification required in subsection (a) of this Section, the lienholder is entitled to recover any storage fees paid to the commercial vehicle relocator or other private towing service to reclaim possession of its collateral.
    (d) An action under this Section may be brought by the lienholder against the commercial vehicle locator or other private towing service in the circuit court.
    (e) Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in this Code, a commercial vehicle relocator or other private towing service seeking to impose storage fees for a vehicle in its possession may not foreclose or otherwise enforce its claim for payment of storage services or any lien relating to the claim pursuant to this Code or other applicable law unless it first complies with the lienholder notification requirements set forth in subsection (a) of this Section.
    (f) If the vehicle that is removed or towed is registered in a state other than Illinois, the assessment and accrual of storage fees may commence on the date that the request for lienholder information is filed by the commercial vehicle relocator or other private towing service with the applicable administrative agency or office in that state if: (i) the commercial vehicle relocator or other private towing service furnishes the lienholder with a copy or proof of filing of the request for lienholder information; (ii) the commercial vehicle relocator or other private towing service provides to the lienholder of record the notification required by this Section within one business day after receiving the requested lienholder information; and (iii) the assessment of storage fees complies with any applicable limitations set forth by a municipality authorizing the vehicle removal.

    (625 ILCS 5/4-301) (from Ch. 95 1/2, par. 4-301)
    Sec. 4-301. State policy. The General Assembly finds that abandoned and derelict vehicles: constitute a safety hazard and a public nuisance; are detrimental to the health, safety and welfare of the general public by harboring disease, providing breeding places for vermin, inviting plundering, creating fire hazards, and presenting physical dangers to children and others; produce scenic blights which degrade the environment and adversely affect land values and the proper maintenance and continuing development of the State of Illinois and all of its subdivisions; represent a resource out of place and an energy loss to the Illinois economy, and require state and local governmental attention, in conjunction with any federal governmental attention, in order to assure the expeditious removal and recycling of these abandoned and derelict vehicles.
    The General Assembly declares therefore, that it is the policy of the State of Illinois, to:
    1. Prohibit the abandonment of vehicles and the retention of derelicts, and to enforce such prohibition by law while reminding vehicle owners of their own individual responsibility to dispose of such vehicles;
    2. Encourage the development of procedures and techniques to facilitate the expeditious removal of abandoned and derelict vehicles from public or private premises;
    3. Encourage the State of Illinois and all of its political subdivisions, in cooperation with the federal government and the private sector of our State, and in cooperation with other states of the United States, to recover and recycle the resource represented by abandoned and derelict vehicles to the fullest extent practicable.

    In adopting such programs, the Board shall take into consideration the programs of the federal government in the same field, so as to assure full coordination therewith and that the State of Illinois does not duplicate federal actions and programs. The programs to be considered by the Board shall in addition be designed to:
        1. Effect the efficient removal of abandoned vehicles
    	
from the highways, streets, roads, other public property, as well as from private property within Illinois.
        2. Effect the efficient removal of abandoned and
    	
derelict vehicles from private property to be junked, salvaged, recycled, or reclaimed, to wrecking, recycling or salvaging facilities, or to a temporary impoundment or area collection center.
        3. Effect efficient recycling or scrap processing of
    	
retired vehicles and the salvaging of usable parts.
        4. Permit the restoration of antique and historic
    	
vehicles by private persons or agencies.
        5. Work with other State agencies to effect the
    	
efficient and effective recycling of solid and liquid motor vehicle waste, including motor vehicle drain oil, derived in the recycling of a motor vehicle.
        6. Recoup the costs of removal and disposal of
    	
abandoned and derelict vehicles from vehicle owners, land owners and persons who abandon or discard such vehicles and from other suitable sources.
        7. Promote and publicize individual responsibility of
    	
vehicle owners for their personal disposal of unwanted and discarded vehicles and develop an effective promotional campaign to show owners how to properly dispose of such vehicles; and the legal consequences of not doing so.
        8. Provide State coordination, expertise and
    	
assistance to all local units of government, as needed, seeking legislative remedy where appropriate regarding: vehicle detitling procedure; impoundment time periods; the legal restrictions unnecessarily delaying vehicle disposal; and, to promote and advance the technology, growth and development of the legitimate auto recycling industry to the end that this industry can effectively recycle all vehicles annually retired and accumulated in Illinois with a minimum of assistance from the State or its subdivisions.
    The Board is empowered to negotiate and enter into reciprocal agreements with other states and State and federal agencies, in furtherance of the provisions of this Act, as amended; provided, however, that no such reciprocal agreement may be entered into without the approval and authorization of the State body legally required to approve such agreements.
    The Board shall make rules, regulations and by-laws, not inconsistent with this Act or any other law of this State, as to its own organization and conduct and for the implementation and administration of this Act.
    The Board is further empowered to enter into an agreement with any State agency represented on the Board, to carry out the administration of the abandoned and derelict vehicle abatement program of the Board, and to make such funds available as may be found necessary by the Board, as appropriated by the General Assembly.

If not otherwise economically practicable, the Board may provide by contract with private persons or agencies, or with political subdivisions of the State of Illinois and all local governmental units of government, for the inventory, collection and disposal or any portion thereof, of abandoned and derelict vehicles to wrecking, salvage or recycling plants, or, provide facilities for the collection and proper disposal of any vehicle under the provisions of this Act, as amended.
    The Board may further formulate a program, statewide or within prescribed areas, for the inventory and collection of abandoned and derelict vehicles and to provide for their junking, salvage or recycling. In all cases, the Board shall coordinate such program with each affected State agency, local governmental unit, and local law enforcement agencies.
    The Board may further subsidize political subdivisions of this State, local governmental units and local law enforcement agencies for their costs, provable by audit and not otherwise recoverable from any proceeds derived from any sale of abandoned and derelict vehicles, in collecting, storing and disposing of such vehicles during a reimbursement period set by the Board.
    Any expenditure of funds hereunder shall be subject to audit by the Auditor General, within the appropriations for this purpose by the General Assembly, and may be made only in the event that cost-analysis and program efficiency show that such reimbursement subsidy is justified. No owner of any abandoned or derelict vehicle shall in any way, receive any funds hereunder. This shall not, however, prohibit the Board from examining the strategy of paying owners of discarded vehicles a limited sum for delivering their vehicles to a collection point when scrap prices are depressed; and bringing emergency measures such as this to the attention of the General Assembly for its consideration at a later time.

It shall include an office in which the dealer's records shall be separate and distinct from any other business or tenant which may occupy space in the same building except as provided in Section 5-101.1. This office shall not be located in a house trailer, residence, tent, temporary stand, temporary address, room or rooms in a hotel or rooming house, nor the premises occupied by a single or multiple unit residence. The established place of business of a scrap processor shall be the fixed location where the scrap processor maintains its principal place of business. The Secretary of State shall, by rule and regulation, adopt guidelines for the administration and enforcement of this definition, such as, but not limited to issues concerning the required hours of operation, describing where vehicles are displayed and offered for sale, where books and records are maintained and requirements for the fulfillment of warranties. A dealer may have an additional place of business as defined under this Section.
    "Motor vehicle financing affiliate" means a business organization registered to do business in Illinois that, pursuant to a written contract with either (1) a single new or used motor vehicle dealer or (2) a single group of new or used motor vehicle dealers that share a common ownership within the group, purchases new or used motor vehicles on behalf of the dealer or group of dealers and then sells, transfers, or assigns those motor vehicles to the dealer or group of dealers.

    "Off site sale" means the temporary display and sale of vehicles, for a period of not more than 7 calendar days (excluding Sundays), by a dealer licensed under Section 5-101 or 5-102 at a place other than the dealer's established and additional places of business.

    (625 ILCS 5/5-100-1) (from Ch. 95 1/2, par. 5-100-1)
    Sec. 5-100-1. Findings and Purpose. The General Assembly finds that: (1) crimes involving the theft of vehicles and their parts have risen steadily over the past years, with a resulting loss of millions of dollars to the residents of this State; (2) essential to the criminal enterprise of vehicle theft operations is the ability of thieves to transfer or sell stolen vehicles or their parts through legitimate commercial channels, making them available for sale to the automotive industry; (3) vehicle dealers, scrap processors, automotive parts recyclers, repairers and rebuilders who comprise the vast majority of the persons engaged in the automotive business in this State are frequently exposed to pressures and influences from motor vehicle thieves; (4) elements of organized crime are constantly attempting to influence businessmen engaged in the sale and repair of motor vehicles so as to further their own criminal interests; and (5) close and strict government regulation of vehicle dealers, scrap processors, automotive parts recyclers, repairers and rebuilders will provide a system of tracking the flow of vehicles and their essential parts and therefore significantly reduce the numbers of vehicle-related thefts in this State. It is, therefore, the intent of the General Assembly to establish a system of mandatory licensing and record keeping which will prevent or reduce the transfer or sale of stolen vehicles or their parts within this State.
    It further is the intent of the General Assembly that government agencies work in cooperation with vehicle dealers, scrap processors, automotive parts recyclers, repairers and rebuilders, utilizing their professional expertise in the development and execution of programs and strategies to reduce vehicle-related crime and maximize consumer protection while ensuring a healthy business climate for the legitimate automotive industry.

    (625 ILCS 5/5-102) (from Ch. 95 1/2, par. 5-102)
    Sec. 5-102. Used vehicle dealers must be licensed.
    (a) No person, other than a licensed new vehicle dealer, shall engage in the business of selling or dealing in, on consignment or otherwise, 5 or more used vehicles of any make during the year (except house trailers as authorized by paragraph (j) of this Section and rebuilt salvage vehicles sold by their rebuilders to persons licensed under this Chapter), or act as an intermediary, agent or broker for any licensed dealer or vehicle purchaser (other than as a salesperson) or represent or advertise that he is so engaged or intends to so engage in such business unless licensed to do so by the Secretary of State under the provisions of this Section.
    (b) An application for a used vehicle dealer's license shall be filed with the Secretary of State, duly verified by oath, in such form as the Secretary of State may by rule or regulation prescribe and shall contain:
        1. The name and type of business organization
    	
established and additional places of business, if any, in this State.
        2. If the applicant is a corporation, a list of its
    	
officers, directors, and shareholders having a ten percent or greater ownership interest in the corporation, setting forth the residence address of each; if the applicant is a sole proprietorship, a partnership, an unincorporated association, a trust, or any similar form of business organization, the names and residence address of the proprietor or of each partner, member, officer, director, trustee or manager.
        3. A statement that the applicant has been approved
    	
for registration under the Retailers' Occupation Tax Act by the Department of Revenue. However, this requirement does not apply to a dealer who is already licensed hereunder with the Secretary of State, and who is merely applying for a renewal of his license. As evidence of this fact, the application shall be accompanied by a certification from the Department of Revenue showing that the Department has approved the applicant for registration under the Retailers' Occupation Tax Act.
        4. A statement that the applicant has complied with
    	
the appropriate liability insurance requirement. A Certificate of Insurance in a solvent company authorized to do business in the State of Illinois shall be included with each application covering each location at which he proposes to act as a used vehicle dealer. The policy must provide liability coverage in the minimum amounts of $100,000 for bodily injury to, or death of, any person, $300,000 for bodily injury to, or death of, two or more persons in any one accident, and $50,000 for damage to property. Such policy shall expire not sooner than December 31 of the year for which the license was issued or renewed. The expiration of the insurance policy shall not terminate the liability under the policy arising during the period for which the policy was filed. Trailer and mobile home dealers are exempt from this requirement.
        If the permitted user has a liability insurance
    	
policy that provides automobile liability insurance coverage of at least $100,000 for bodily injury to or the death of any person, $300,000 for bodily injury to or the death of any 2 or more persons in any one accident, and $50,000 for damage to property, then the permitted user's insurer shall be the primary insurer and the dealer's insurer shall be the secondary insurer. If the permitted user does not have a liability insurance policy that provides automobile liability insurance coverage of at least $100,000 for bodily injury to or the death of any person, $300,000 for bodily injury to or the death of any 2 or more persons in any one accident, and $50,000 for damage to property, or does not have any insurance at all, then the dealer's insurer shall be the primary insurer and the permitted user's insurer shall be the secondary insurer.
        When a permitted user is "test driving" a used
    	
vehicle dealer's automobile, the used vehicle dealer's insurance shall be primary and the permitted user's insurance shall be secondary.
        As used in this paragraph 4, a "permitted user" is a
    	
person who, with the permission of the used vehicle dealer or an employee of the used vehicle dealer, drives a vehicle owned and held for sale or lease by the used vehicle dealer which the person is considering to purchase or lease, in order to evaluate the performance, reliability, or condition of the vehicle. The term "permitted user" also includes a person who, with the permission of the used vehicle dealer, drives a vehicle owned or held for sale or lease by the used vehicle dealer for loaner purposes while the user's vehicle is being repaired or evaluated.
        As used in this paragraph 4, "test driving" occurs
    	
when a permitted user who, with the permission of the used vehicle dealer or an employee of the used vehicle dealer, drives a vehicle owned and held for sale or lease by a used vehicle dealer that the person is considering to purchase or lease, in order to evaluate the performance, reliability, or condition of the vehicle.
        As used in this paragraph 4, "loaner purposes" means
    	
when a person who, with the permission of the used vehicle dealer, drives a vehicle owned or held for sale or lease by the used vehicle dealer while the user's vehicle is being repaired or evaluated.
        5. An application for a used vehicle dealer's license
    	
shall be accompanied by the following license fees:
            (A) $1,000 for applicant's established place of
        	
business, and $50 for each additional place of business, if any, to which the application pertains; however, if the application is made after June 15 of any year, the license fee shall be $500 for applicant's established place of business plus $25 for each additional place of business, if any, to which the application pertains. License fees shall be returnable only in the event that the application is denied by the Secretary of State. Of the money received by the Secretary of State as license fees under this subparagraph (A) for the 2004 licensing year and thereafter, 95% shall be deposited into the General Revenue Fund.
            (B) Except for dealers selling 25 or fewer
        	
automobiles or as provided in subsection (h) of Section 5-102.7 of this Code, an Annual Dealer Recovery Fund Fee in the amount of $500 for the applicant's established place of business, and $50 for each additional place of business, if any, to which the application pertains; but if the application is made after June 15 of any year, the fee shall be $250 for the applicant's established place of business plus $25 for each additional place of business, if any, to which the application pertains. For a license renewal application, the fee shall be based on the amount of automobiles sold in the past year according to the following formula:
                (1) $0 for dealers selling 25 or less
            	
automobiles;
                (2) $150 for dealers selling more than 25 but
            	
less than 200 automobiles;
                (3) $300 for dealers selling 200 or more
            	
automobiles but less than 300 automobiles; and
                (4) $500 for dealers selling 300 or more
            	
automobiles.
            License fees shall be returnable only in the
        	
event that the application is denied by the Secretary of State. Moneys received under this subparagraph (B) shall be deposited into the Dealer Recovery Trust Fund.
        6. A statement that the applicant's officers,

    Sec. 5-102.7. Dealer Recovery Trust Fund.
    (a) The General Assembly finds that motor vehicle dealers that go out of business without fulfilling agreements to pay off the balance of their customers' liens on traded-in vehicles cause financial harm to those customers by leaving those customers liable for multiple vehicle loans and cause harm to the integrity of the motor vehicle retailing industry. It is the intent of the General Assembly to protect vehicle purchasers by creating a Dealer Recovery Trust Fund to reimburse these consumers.
    (b) The Dealer Recovery Trust Fund shall be used solely for the limited purpose of helping victims of dealership closings.

The fee shall be in addition to any other fees imposed under this Article, shall be submitted at the same time an application or renewal for a new vehicle dealer's license, used vehicle dealer's license, or Buy Here, Pay Here used vehicle dealer is submitted, and shall be made payable to and remitted directly to the Dealer Recovery Trust Fund, a trust fund outside of the State Treasury which is hereby created.

The Fund Administrator shall purchase liability insurance to cover management of the Fund at a cost not to exceed 2% of the balance in the Fund as of January 15th of that year.
    (h) In any year for which the balance in the Fund as of August 31st is greater than $3,500,000, the Fund Administrator shall notify the Secretary of State and the Secretary of State shall suspend collection of the fee for the following year for any dealer who has not had a claim paid from the Fund, has not had his or her license suspended or revoked, and has not been assessed any civil penalties under this Code during the 3 previous years.
    (i) Moneys in the Dealer Recovery Trust Fund may be paid from the Fund only as directed by a written order of the Board and used only for the following purposes:
        (i) to pay claims under a written order of the Board

    (j) The Dealer Recovery Trust Fund Board is hereby created. The Board shall consist of the Secretary of State, or his or her designee, who shall serve as chair, the Attorney General, or his or her designee, who shall serve as secretary, and one person alternatively representing new and independent Illinois automobile dealers, selected collectively by the Attorney General, or his or her designee, and the Secretary of State, or his or her designee.

The Board may not pay out any claims before the balance deposited into the Fund exceeds $500,000. Board meetings shall be open to the public. The Board has the authority to take any action by at least a two-thirds majority vote.
    (k) The following persons may apply to the Board for reimbursement from the Dealer Recovery Trust Fund:
        (i) A retail customer who, on or after October 1,
    	
2011, purchases a vehicle from a dealer who subsequently files for bankruptcy or whose vehicle dealer's license is subsequently revoked by the Secretary of State or otherwise terminated and, as part of the purchase transaction, trades in a vehicle with an outstanding lien to the dealer if lien satisfaction was a condition of the purchase agreement and the retail customer determines that the lien has not been satisfied;
        (ii) A retail customer who, on or after October 1,
    	
2011, purchases a vehicle with an undisclosed lien from a dealer who subsequently files for bankruptcy or whose vehicle dealer's license is subsequently revoked by the Secretary of State or otherwise terminated;
        (iii) A dealer who, on or after October 1, 2011,
    	
purchases a vehicle with an undisclosed lien from another dealer who subsequently files for bankruptcy or whose vehicle dealer's license is subsequently revoked by the Secretary of State or otherwise terminated.
    (l) To be considered by the Board, an applicant must submit his or her claim to the Board within 2 years after the date of the transaction that gave rise to the claim.
    (m) At each meeting of the Board, it shall consider all claims that are properly submitted to it on forms prescribed by the Secretary of State at least 30 days before the date of the Board's meeting. Before the Board may consider a claim against a dealer, it must make a written determination that the dealer has filed for bankruptcy under the provisions of 11 U.S.C. Chapter 7; that the Secretary of State has revoked his or her dealer's license; or that the license has been otherwise terminated. Once the Board has made this determination, it may consider the applicant's claim against the dealer. If a two-thirds majority of the Board determines that the dealer has committed a violation under subsection (k), it shall grant the applicant's claim. Except as otherwise provided in this Section, the maximum amount of any award for a claim under paragraph (i) of subsection (k) of this Section shall be equal to the amount of the unpaid balance of the lien that the dealer agreed to pay off on behalf of the applicant as shown on the bill of sale or the retail installment sales contract. The maximum amount of any claim under paragraph (ii) or (iii) of subsection (k) of this Section shall be equal to the amount of the undisclosed lien. However, no award for a claim under subsection (k) of this Section shall exceed $35,000.
    (n) If the balance in the Fund at the time of any Board meeting is less than the amount of the total amount of all claims awarded at that meeting, then all awards made at that meeting shall be reduced, pro rata, so that the amount of claims does not exceed the balance in the Fund. Before it reviews new claims, the Board shall issue written orders to pay the remaining portion of any claims that were so reduced, provided that the balance in the Fund is sufficient to pay those claims.
    (o) Whenever the balance of the Fund falls below $500,000, the Board may charge dealers an additional assessment of up to $50 to bring the balance to at least $500,000. Not more than one additional assessment may be made against a dealer in any 12-month period.
    (p) If the total amount of claims awarded against any dealer exceeds 33% of the balance in the Fund, the Board may permanently reduce the amount of those claims, pro rata, so that those claims do not exceed 33% of the balance in the Fund.
    (q) The Board shall issue a written order directing the Fund Administrator to pay an applicant's claim to a secured party where the Board has received a signed agreement between the applicant and the secured party holding the lien. The agreement must (i) state that the applicant and the secured party agree to accept payment from the Fund to the secured party as settlement in full of all claims against the dealer; and (ii) release the lien and the title, if applicable, to the vehicle that was the subject of the claim. The written order shall state the amount of the claim and the name and address of the secured party to whom the claim shall be paid. The Fund Administrator shall pay the claim within 30 days after it receives the Board's order.
    (r) No dealer or principal associated with a dealer's license is eligible for licensure, renewal or relicensure until the full amount of reimbursement for an unpaid claim, plus interest as determined by the Board, is paid to the Fund. Nothing in this Section shall limit the authority of the Secretary of State to suspend, revoke, or levy civil penalties against a dealer, nor shall full repayment of the amount owed to the Fund nullify or modify the effect of any action by the Secretary.
    (s) Nothing in this Section shall limit the right of any person to seek relief though civil action against any other person as an alternative to seeking reimbursement from the Fund.

            (J) The sale price of the vehicle, if applicable.
        (2) (A) The following records pertaining to used

            (ii) the vehicle's manufacturer's identification

            (iii) the date of the acquisition of each part;
            (iv) the name and address of the person from whom

            (v) the uniform invoice number or out-of-state

            (vi) the stock number assigned to the essential

            (ix) the uniform invoice number reflecting the

        (C) A separate entry containing all of the
    	
information required to be recorded in subparagraph (A) of paragraph (2) of subsection (a) of this Section shall be made for each separate essential part. Separate entries shall be made regardless of whether the part was a large purchase acquisition. In addition, a separate entry shall be made for each part acquired for immediate sale or transfer, or for placement into the overall inventory or stock to be disposed of at a later time, or for use on a vehicle to be materially altered by the licensee, or acquired for any other purpose or reason. Failure to make a separate entry for each essential part acquired or disposed of, or a failure to record any of the specific information required to be recorded concerning the acquisition or disposition of each essential part as set forth in subparagraph (A) of paragraph (2) of subsection (a) shall constitute a failure to keep records.
        (D) The vehicle's manufacturer's identification
    	
number or Secretary of State or Illinois Department of State Police identification number for the essential part shall be ascertained and recorded even if such part is acquired from a person or dealer located in a State, territory, or country which does not require that such information be recorded. If the vehicle's manufacturer's identification number or Secretary of State or Illinois Department of State Police identification number for an essential part cannot be obtained, that part shall not be acquired by the licensee or any of his agents or employees. If such part or parts were physically acquired by the licensee or any of his agents or employees while the licensee or agent or employee was outside this State, that licensee or agent or employee was outside the State, that licensee, agent or employee shall not bring such essential part into this State or cause it to be brought into this State. The acquisition or disposition of an essential part by a licensee without the recording of the vehicle identification number or Secretary of State identification number for such part or the transportation into the State by the licensee or his agent or employee of such part or parts shall constitute a failure to keep records.
        (E) The records of essential parts required to be
    	
kept by this Section shall apply to all hulks, chassis, frames or cowls, regardless of the age of those essential parts. The records required to be kept by this Section for essential parts other than hulks, chassis, frames or cowls, shall apply only to those essential parts which are 6 model years of age or newer. In determining the model year of such an essential part it may be presumed that the identification number of the vehicle from which the essential part came or the identification number affixed to the essential part itself acquired by the licensee denotes the model year of that essential part. This presumption, however, shall not apply if the gross appearance of the essential part does not correspond to the year, make or model of either the identification number of the vehicle from which the essential part is alleged to have come or the identification number which is affixed to the essential part itself. To determine whether an essential part is 6 years of age or newer within this paragraph, the model year of the essential part shall be subtracted from the calendar year in which the essential part is acquired or disposed of by the licensee. If the remainder is 6 or less, the record of the acquisition or disposition of that essential part shall be kept as required by this Section.
        (F) The requirements of paragraph (2) of subsection
    	
(a) of this Section shall not apply to the disposition of an essential part other than a cowl which has been damaged or altered to a state in which it can no longer be returned to a usable condition and which is being sold or transferred to a scrap processor or for delivery to a scrap processor.
    (3) the following records for vehicles on which junking certificates are obtained shall be kept:
        (A) the year, make, model, style and color of the
    	
vehicle;
        (B) the vehicle's manufacturer's identification
    	
number or, if applicable, the Secretary of State or Illinois Department of State Police identification number;
        (C) the date the vehicle was acquired;
        (D) the name and address of the person from whom the
    	
vehicle was acquired and, if that person is a dealer, the Illinois or out-of-state dealer license number of that person;
        (E) the certificate of title number or salvage
    	
certificate number for the vehicle, if applicable;
        (F) the junking certificate number obtained by the
    	
licensee; this entry shall be recorded at the close of business of the fifth business day after receiving the junking certificate;
        (G) the name and address of the person to whom the
    	
junking certificate has been assigned, if applicable, and if that person is a dealer, the Illinois or out-of-state dealer license number of that dealer;
        (H) if the vehicle or any part of the vehicle is
    	
dismantled for its parts to be disposed of in any way, or if such parts are to be used by the licensee to materially alter a vehicle, those essential parts shall be recorded and the entries required by paragraph (2) of subsection (a) shall be made.
    (4) The following records for rebuilt vehicles shall be kept:
        (A) the year, make, model, style and color of the
    	
vehicle;
        (B) the vehicle's manufacturer's identification
    	
number of the vehicle or, if applicable, the Secretary of State or Illinois Department of State Police identification number;
        (C) the date the vehicle was acquired;
        (D) the name and address of the person from whom the
    	
vehicle was acquired, and if that person is a dealer, the Illinois or out-of-state dealer license number of that person;
        (E) the salvage certificate number for the vehicle;
        (F) the newly issued certificate of title number for
    	
the vehicle;
        (G) the date of disposition of the vehicle;
        (H) the name and address of the person to whom the
    	
vehicle was disposed, and if a dealer, the Illinois or out-of-state dealer license number of that dealer;
        (I) The sale price of the vehicle.
    (a-1) A person licensed or required to be licensed under Section 5-101 or Section 5-102 of this Code who issues temporary registration permits as permitted by this Code and by rule must electronically file the registration with the Secretary and must maintain records of the registration in the manner prescribed by the Secretary.
    (b) A failure to make separate entries for each vehicle acquired, disposed of, or assigned, or a failure to record any of the specific information required to be recorded concerning the acquisition or disposition of each vehicle as set forth in paragraphs (1), (3) and (4) of subsection (a) shall constitute a failure to keep records.
    (c) All entries relating to the acquisition of a vehicle or essential part required by subsection (a) of this Section shall be recorded no later than the close of business on the seventh calendar day following such acquisition. All entries relating to the disposition of a vehicle or an essential part shall be made at the time of such disposition. If the vehicle or essential part was disposed of on the same day as its acquisition or the day thereafter, the entries relating to the acquisition of the vehicle or essential part shall be made at the time of the disposition of the vehicle or essential part. Failure to make the entries required in or at the times prescribed by this subsection following the acquisition or disposition of such vehicle or essential part shall constitute a failure to keep records.
    (d) Every person licensed or required to be licensed shall, before accepting delivery of a used vehicle, inspect the vehicle to determine whether the manufacturer's public vehicle identification number has been defaced, destroyed, falsified, removed, altered, or tampered with in any way. If the person making the inspection determines that the manufacturer's public vehicle identification number has been altered, removed, defaced, destroyed, falsified or tampered with he shall not acquire that vehicle but instead shall promptly notify law enforcement authorities of his finding.
    (e) The information required to be kept in subsection (a) of this Section shall be kept in a manner prescribed by rule or regulation of the Secretary of State.
    (f) Every person licensed or required to be licensed shall have in his possession a separate certificate of title, salvage certificate, junking certificate, certificate of purchase, uniform invoice, out-of-state bill of sale or other acceptable documentary evidence of his right to the possession of every vehicle or essential part.
    (g) Every person licensed or required to be licensed as a transporter under Section 5-201 shall maintain for 3 years, in such form as the Secretary of State may by rule or regulation prescribe, at his principal place of business a record of every vehicle transported by him, including numbers of or other marks of identification thereof, the names and addresses of persons from whom and to whom the vehicle was delivered and the dates of delivery.
    (h) No later than 15 days prior to going out of business, selling the business, or transferring the ownership of the business, the licensee shall notify the Secretary of State that he is going out of business or that he is transferring the ownership of the business. Failure to notify under this paragraph shall constitute a failure to keep records.
    (i) (Blank).
    (j) A person who knowingly fails to comply with the provisions of this Section or knowingly fails to obey, observe, or comply with any order of the Secretary or any law enforcement agency issued in accordance with this Section is guilty of a Class B misdemeanor for the first violation and a Class A misdemeanor for the second and subsequent violations. Each violation constitutes a separate and distinct offense and a separate count may be brought in the same indictment or information for each vehicle or each essential part of a vehicle for which a record was not kept as required by this Section.
    (k) Any person convicted of failing to keep the records required by this Section with intent to conceal the identity or origin of a vehicle or its essential parts or with intent to defraud the public in the transfer or sale of vehicles or their essential parts is guilty of a Class 2 felony. Each violation constitutes a separate and distinct offense and a separate count may be brought in the same indictment or information for each vehicle or essential part of a vehicle for which a record was not kept as required by this Section.
    (l) A person may not be criminally charged with or convicted of both a knowing failure to comply with this Section and a knowing failure to comply with any order, if both offenses involve the same record keeping violation.
    (m) The Secretary shall adopt rules necessary for implementation of this Section, which may include the imposition of administrative fines.

No scrap metal processor shall sell a vehicle or essential part, as such, except for engines, transmissions, and powertrains, unless licensed to do so under another provision of this Code. A scrap processor who is additionally licensed as an automotive parts recycler shall not be subject to the record keeping requirements for a scrap processor when acting as an automotive parts recycler.

scrap processor shall, for each transaction, record the identity of the person from whom the recyclable metals were acquired by verifying the identification of that person from one source of identification, which shall be a valid driver's license or State Identification Card, on the scrap processor's weight ticket at the time of the acquisition and by making and recording a color photocopy or electronic scan of the driver's license or State Identification Card. Such information shall be available for inspection by any law enforcement official. If the person delivering the recyclable metal does not have a valid driver's license or State Identification Card, the scrap processor shall not complete the transaction. The inspection of records pertaining only to recyclable metals shall not be counted as an inspection of a premises for purposes of subparagraph (7) of Section 5-403 of this Code.
        This subdivision (a)(5) does not apply to electrical
    	
contractors, to agencies or instrumentalities of the State of Illinois or of the United States, to common carriers, to purchases from persons, firms, or corporations regularly engaged in the business of manufacturing recyclable metal, in the business of selling recyclable metal at retail or wholesale, or in the business of razing, demolishing, destroying, or removing buildings, to the purchase by one recyclable metal dealer from another, or the purchase from persons, firms, or corporations engaged in either the generation, transmission, or distribution of electric energy or in telephone, telegraph, and other communications if such common carriers, persons, firms, or corporations at the time of the purchase provide the recyclable metal dealer with a bill of sale or other written evidence of title to the recyclable metal.

    Sec. 5-402.1. Use of Secretary of State Uniform Invoice for Essential Parts.
    (a) Except for scrap processors, every person licensed or required to be licensed under Section 5-101, 5-101.1, 5-102, 5-102.8, or 5-301 of this Code shall issue, in a form the Secretary of State may by rule or regulation prescribe, a Uniform Invoice, which may also act as a bill of sale, made out in triplicate with respect to each transaction in which he disposes of an essential part other than quarter panels and transmissions of vehicles of the first division. Such Invoice shall be made out at the time of the disposition of the essential part. If the licensee disposes of several essential parts in the same transaction, the licensee may issue one Uniform Invoice covering all essential parts disposed of in that transaction.
    (b) The following information shall be contained on the Uniform Invoice:
        (1) the business name, address and dealer license
    	
number of the person disposing of the essential part;
        (2) the name and address of the person acquiring the
    	
essential part, and if that person is a dealer, the Illinois or out-of-state dealer license number of that dealer;
        (3) the date of the disposition of the essential part;
        (4) the year, make, model, color and description of
    	
each essential part disposed of by the person;
        (5) the manufacturer's vehicle identification number,
    	
Secretary of State identification number or Illinois Department of State Police identification number, for each essential part disposed of by the person;
        (6) the printed name and legible signature of the
    	
person or agent disposing of the essential part; and
        (7) if the person is a dealer the printed name and
    	
legible signature of the dealer or his agent or employee accepting delivery of the essential part.
    (c) Except for scrap processors, and except as set forth in subsection (d) of this Section, whenever a person licensed or required to be licensed by Section 5-101, 5-101.1, 5-102, or 5-301 accepts delivery of an essential part, other than quarter panels and transmissions of vehicles of the first division, that person shall, at the time of the acceptance or delivery, comply with the following procedures:
        (1) Before acquiring or accepting delivery of any
    	
essential part, the licensee or his authorized agent or employee shall inspect the part to determine whether the vehicle identification number, Secretary of State identification number, Illinois Department of State Police identification number, or identification plate or sticker attached to or stamped on any part being acquired or delivered has been removed, falsified, altered, defaced, destroyed, or tampered with. If the licensee or his agent or employee determines that the vehicle identification number, Secretary of State identification number, Illinois Department of State Police identification number, identification plate or identification sticker containing an identification number, or Federal Certificate label of an essential part has been removed, falsified, altered, defaced, destroyed or tampered with, the licensee or agent shall not accept or receive that part.
        If that part was physically acquired by or delivered
    	
to a licensee or his agent or employee while that licensee, agent or employee was outside this State, that licensee or agent or employee shall not bring that essential part into this State or cause it to be brought into this State.
        (2) If the person disposing of or delivering the
    	
essential part to the licensee is a licensed in-state or out-of-state dealer, the licensee or his agent or employee, after inspecting the essential part as required by paragraph (1) of this subsection (c), shall examine the Uniform Invoice, or bill of sale, as the case may be, to ensure that it contains all the information required to be provided by persons disposing of essential parts as set forth in subsection (b) of this Section. If the Uniform Invoice or bill of sale does not contain all the information required to be listed by subsection (b) of this Section, the dealer disposing of or delivering such part or his agent or employee shall record such additional information or other needed modifications on the Uniform Invoice or bill of sale or, if needed, an attachment thereto. The dealer or his agent or employee delivering the essential part shall initial all additions or modifications to the Uniform Invoice or bill of sale and legibly print his name at the bottom of each document containing his initials. If the transaction involves a bill of sale rather than a Uniform Invoice, the licensee or his agent or employee accepting delivery of or acquiring the essential part shall affix his printed name and legible signature on the space on the bill of sale provided for his signature or, if no space is provided, on the back of the bill of sale. If the dealer or his agent or employee disposing of or delivering the essential part cannot or does not provide all the information required by subsection (b) of this Section, the licensee or his agent or employee shall not accept or receive any essential part for which that required information is not provided. If such essential part for which the information required is not fully provided was physically acquired while the licensee or his agent or employee was outside this State, the licensee or his agent or employee shall not bring that essential part into this State or cause it to be brought into this State.
        (3) If the person disposing of the essential part is
    	
not a licensed dealer, the licensee or his agent or employee shall, after inspecting the essential part as required by paragraph (1) of subsection (c) of this Section verify the identity of the person disposing of the essential part by examining 2 sources of identification, one of which shall be either a driver's license or state identification card. The licensee or his agent or employee shall then prepare a Uniform Invoice listing all the information required to be provided by subsection (b) of this Section. In the space on the Uniform Invoice provided for the dealer license number of the person disposing of the part, the licensee or his agent or employee shall list the numbers taken from the documents of identification provided by the person disposing of the part. The person disposing of the part shall affix his printed name and legible signature on the space on the Uniform Invoice provided for the person disposing of the essential part and the licensee or his agent or employee acquiring the part shall affix his printed name and legible signature on the space provided on the Uniform Invoice for the person acquiring the essential part. If the person disposing of the essential part cannot or does not provide all the information required to be provided by this paragraph, or does not present 2 satisfactory forms of identification, the licensee or his agent or employee shall not acquire that essential part.
    (d) If an essential part other than quarter panels and transmissions of vehicles of the first division was delivered by a licensed commercial delivery service delivering such part on behalf of a licensed dealer, the person required to comply with subsection (c) of this Section may conduct the inspection of that part required by paragraph (1) of subsection (c) and examination of the Uniform Invoice or bill of sale required by paragraph (2) of subsection (c) of this Section immediately after the acceptance of the part.
        (1) If the inspection of the essential part pursuant
    	
to paragraph (1) of subsection (c) reveals that the vehicle identification number, Secretary of State identification number, Illinois Department of State Police identification number, identification plate or sticker containing an identification number, or Federal Certificate label of an essential part has been removed, falsified, altered, defaced, destroyed or tampered with, the licensee or his agent shall immediately record such fact on the Uniform Invoice or bill of sale, assign the part an inventory or stock number, place such inventory or stock number on both the essential part and the Uniform Invoice or bill of sale, and record the date of the inspection of the part on the Uniform Invoice or bill of sale. The licensee shall, within 7 days of such inspection, return such part to the dealer from whom it was acquired.
        (2) If the examination of the Uniform Invoice or bill
    	
of sale pursuant to paragraph (2) of subsection (c) reveals that any of the information required to be listed by subsection (b) of this Section is missing, the licensee or person required to be licensed shall immediately assign a stock or inventory number to such part, place such stock or inventory number on both the essential part and the Uniform Invoice or bill of sale, and record the date of examination on the Uniform Invoice or bill of sale. The licensee or person required to be licensed shall acquire the information missing from the Uniform Invoice or bill of sale within 7 days of the examination of such Uniform Invoice or bill of sale. Such information may be received by telephone conversation with the dealer from whom the part was acquired. If the dealer provides the missing information the licensee shall record such information on the Uniform Invoice or bill of sale along with the name of the person providing the information. If the dealer does not provide the required information within the aforementioned 7 day period, the licensee shall return the part to that dealer.
    (e) Except for scrap processors, all persons licensed or required to be licensed who acquire or dispose of essential parts other than quarter panels and transmissions of vehicles of the first division shall retain a copy of the Uniform Invoice required to be made by subsections (a), (b) and (c) of this Section for a period of 3 years.
    (f) Except for scrap processors, any person licensed or required to be licensed under Sections 5-101, 5-102 or 5-301 who knowingly fails to record on a Uniform Invoice any of the information or entries required to be recorded by subsections (a), (b) and (c) of this Section, or who knowingly places false entries or other misleading information on such Uniform Invoice, or who knowingly fails to retain for 3 years a copy of a Uniform Invoice reflecting transactions required to be recorded by subsections (a), (b) and (c) of this Section, or who knowingly acquires or disposes of essential parts without receiving, issuing, or executing a Uniform Invoice reflecting that transaction as required by subsections (a), (b) and (c) of this Section, or who brings or causes to be brought into this State essential parts for which the information required to be recorded on a Uniform Invoice is not recorded as prohibited by subsection (c) of this Section, or who knowingly fails to comply with the provisions of this Section in any other manner shall be guilty of a Class 2 felony. Each violation shall constitute a separate and distinct offense and a separate count may be brought in the same indictment or information for each essential part for which a record was not kept as required by this Section or for which the person failed to comply with other provisions of this Section.
    (g) The records required to be kept by this Section may be examined by a person or persons making a lawful inspection of the licensee's premises pursuant to Section 5-403.
    (h) The records required to be kept by this Section shall be retained by the licensee at his principal place of business for a period of 7 years.
    (i) The requirements of this Section shall not apply to the disposition of an essential part other than a cowl which has been damaged or altered to a state in which it can no longer be returned to a usable condition and which is being sold or transferred to a scrap processor or for delivery to a scrap processor.

Premises that may be inspected in order to determine the accuracy of the books and records required to be kept includes all premises used by the licensee to store vehicles and parts that are reflected by the required books and records.
    (2) Persons having knowledge of or conducting inspections pursuant to this Chapter shall not in advance of such inspections knowingly notify a licensee or representative of a licensee of the contemplated inspection unless the Secretary or an individual designated by him for this purpose authorizes such notification. Any individual who, without authorization, knowingly violates this subparagraph shall be guilty of a Class A misdemeanor.
    (3) The licensee or a representative of the licensee shall be entitled to be present during an inspection conducted pursuant to Chapter 5, however, the presence of the licensee or an authorized representative of the licensee is not a condition precedent to such an inspection.

The fact that a licensee or representative of the licensee leaves the licensed premises after an inspection has been initiated shall not require the termination of the inspection.
    (5) Any inspection conducted pursuant to Chapter 5 shall not continue for more than 24 hours after initiation.
    (6) In the event information comes to the attention of the individuals conducting an inspection that may give rise to the necessity of obtaining a search warrant, and in the event steps are initiated for the procurement of a search warrant, the individuals conducting such inspection may take all necessary steps to secure the premises under inspection until the warrant application is acted upon by a judicial officer.
    (7) No more than 6 inspections of a premises may be conducted pursuant to Chapter 5 within any 6 month period except pursuant to a search warrant. Notwithstanding this limitation, nothing in this subparagraph (7) shall be construed to limit the authority of law enforcement agents to respond to public complaints of violations of the Code. For the purpose of this subparagraph (7), a public complaint is one in which the complainant identifies himself or herself and sets forth, in writing, the specific basis for their complaint against the licensee. For the purpose of this subparagraph (7), the inspection of records pertaining only to recyclable metals, as provided in subdivision (a)(5) of Section 5-401.3 of this Code, shall not be counted as an inspection of a premises.
    (8) Nothing in this Section shall be construed to limit the authority of individuals by the Secretary pursuant to this Section to conduct searches of licensees pursuant to a duly issued and authorized search warrant.
    (9) Any licensee who, having been informed by a person authorized to make inspections and examine records under this Section that he desires to inspect records and the licensee's premises as authorized by this Section, refuses either to produce for that person records required to be kept by this Chapter or to permit such authorized person to make an inspection of the premises in accordance with this Section shall subject the license to immediate suspension by the Secretary of State.
    (10) Beginning July 1, 1988, any person referenced under Section 5-302 shall produce for inspection upon demand those records pertaining to the acquisition of salvage vehicles in this State.

    (i) Each person licensed as a vehicle auctioneer or a licensed new or used car dealer when auctioning vehicles is required to furnish each purchaser of a motor vehicle the following:

attempting to commit within the last 20 years: (i) an offense defined in subsection (c) of Section 4, subsection (b) of Section 5, and subsection (a) of Section 8 of the Cannabis Control Act; or (ii) any offenses in any other state or against the laws of the United States that, if committed or attempted in this State, would be punishable as one or more of the foregoing offenses.
    (b) A school bus driver permit shall be valid for a period specified by the Secretary of State as set forth by rule. It shall be renewable upon compliance with subsection (a) of this Section.
    (c) A school bus driver permit shall contain the holder's driver's license number, legal name, residence address, zip code, and date of birth, a brief description of the holder and a space for signature. The Secretary of State may require a suitable photograph of the holder.
    (d) The employer shall be responsible for conducting a pre-employment interview with prospective school bus driver candidates, distributing school bus driver applications and medical forms to be completed by the applicant, and submitting the applicant's fingerprint cards to the Department of State Police that are required for the criminal background investigations.

Failure of the permit holder to provide the notification is punishable as a petty offense for a first violation and a Class B misdemeanor for a second or subsequent violation.
    (g) Cancellation; suspension; notice and procedure.
        (1) The Secretary of State shall cancel a school bus

        (4) The Secretary of State may not issue a school bus
    	
driver permit for a period of 3 years to an applicant who fails to obtain a negative result on a drug test as required in item 6 of subsection (a) of this Section or under federal law.
        (5) The Secretary of State shall forthwith suspend a

A school bus contractor who violates a provision of this Section is subject to the penalties defined in Section 6-106.11.
    All valid school bus driver permits issued under this Section prior to January 1, 1995, shall remain effective until their expiration date unless otherwise invalidated.

    (625 ILCS 5/6-106.1a)
    Sec. 6-106.1a. Cancellation of school bus driver permit; trace of alcohol.
    (a) A person who has been issued a school bus driver permit by the Secretary of State in accordance with Section 6-106.1 of this Code and who drives or is in actual physical control of a school bus or any other vehicle owned or operated by or for a public or private school, or a school operated by a religious institution, when the vehicle is being used over a regularly scheduled route for the transportation of persons enrolled as students in grade 12 or below, in connection with any activity of the entities listed, upon the public highways of this State shall be deemed to have given consent to a chemical test or tests of blood, breath, other bodily substance, or urine for the purpose of determining the alcohol content of the person's blood if arrested, as evidenced by the issuance of a Uniform Traffic Ticket for any violation of this Code or a similar provision of a local ordinance, if a police officer has probable cause to believe that the driver has consumed any amount of an alcoholic beverage based upon evidence of the driver's physical condition or other first hand knowledge of the police officer. The test or tests shall be administered at the direction of the arresting officer. The law enforcement agency employing the officer shall designate which of the aforesaid tests shall be administered. A urine or other bodily substance test may be administered even after a blood or breath test or both has been administered.
    (b) A person who is dead, unconscious, or who is otherwise in a condition rendering that person incapable of refusal, shall be deemed not to have withdrawn the consent provided by paragraph (a) of this Section and the test or tests may be administered subject to the following provisions:
        (1) Chemical analysis of the person's blood, urine,
    	
breath, or other bodily substance, to be considered valid under the provisions of this Section, shall have been performed according to standards promulgated by the Department of State Police by an individual possessing a valid permit issued by the Department of State Police for this purpose. The Director of State Police is authorized to approve satisfactory techniques or methods, to ascertain the qualifications and competence of individuals to conduct analyses, to issue permits that shall be subject to termination or revocation at the direction of the Department of State Police, and to certify the accuracy of breath testing equipment. The Department of State Police shall prescribe rules as necessary.
        (2) When a person submits to a blood test at the
    	
request of a law enforcement officer under the provisions of this Section, only a physician authorized to practice medicine, a licensed physician assistant, a licensed advanced practice registered nurse, a registered nurse, or other qualified person trained in venipuncture and acting under the direction of a licensed physician may withdraw blood for the purpose of determining the alcohol content. This limitation does not apply to the taking of breath, other bodily substance, or urine specimens.
        (3) The person tested may have a physician, qualified
    	
technician, chemist, registered nurse, or other qualified person of his or her own choosing administer a chemical test or tests in addition to any test or tests administered at the direction of a law enforcement officer. The test administered at the request of the person may be admissible into evidence at a hearing conducted in accordance with Section 2-118 of this Code. The failure or inability to obtain an additional test by a person shall not preclude the consideration of the previously performed chemical test.
        (4) Upon a request of the person who submits to a
    	
chemical test or tests at the request of a law enforcement officer, full information concerning the test or tests shall be made available to the person or that person's attorney by the requesting law enforcement agency within 72 hours of receipt of the test result.
        (5) Alcohol concentration means either grams of
    	
alcohol per 100 milliliters of blood or grams of alcohol per 210 liters of breath.
        (6) If a driver is receiving medical treatment as a
    	
result of a motor vehicle accident, a physician licensed to practice medicine, licensed physician assistant, licensed advanced practice registered nurse, registered nurse, or other qualified person trained in venipuncture and acting under the direction of a licensed physician shall withdraw blood for testing purposes to ascertain the presence of alcohol upon the specific request of a law enforcement officer. However, that testing shall not be performed until, in the opinion of the medical personnel on scene, the withdrawal can be made without interfering with or endangering the well-being of the patient.
    (c) A person requested to submit to a test as provided in this Section shall be warned by the law enforcement officer requesting the test that a refusal to submit to the test, or submission to the test resulting in an alcohol concentration of more than 0.00, may result in the loss of that person's privilege to possess a school bus driver permit. The loss of the individual's privilege to possess a school bus driver permit shall be imposed in accordance with Section 6-106.1b of this Code. A person requested to submit to a test under this Section shall also acknowledge, in writing, receipt of the warning required under this subsection (c). If the person refuses to acknowledge receipt of the warning, the law enforcement officer shall make a written notation on the warning that the person refused to sign the warning. A person's refusal to sign the warning shall not be evidence that the person was not read the warning.
    (d) If the person refuses testing or submits to a test that discloses an alcohol concentration of more than 0.00, the law enforcement officer shall immediately submit a sworn report to the Secretary of State on a form prescribed by the Secretary of State certifying that the test or tests were requested under subsection (a) and the person refused to submit to a test or tests or submitted to testing which disclosed an alcohol concentration of more than 0.00. The law enforcement officer shall submit the same sworn report when a person who has been issued a school bus driver permit and who was operating a school bus or any other vehicle owned or operated by or for a public or private school, or a school operated by a religious institution, when the vehicle is being used over a regularly scheduled route for the transportation of persons enrolled as students in grade 12 or below, in connection with any activity of the entities listed, submits to testing under Section 11-501.1 of this Code and the testing discloses an alcohol concentration of more than 0.00 and less than the alcohol concentration at which driving or being in actual physical control of a motor vehicle is prohibited under paragraph (1) of subsection (a) of Section 11-501.
    Upon receipt of the sworn report of a law enforcement officer, the Secretary of State shall enter the school bus driver permit sanction on the individual's driving record and the sanction shall be effective on the 46th day following the date notice of the sanction was given to the person.
    The law enforcement officer submitting the sworn report shall serve immediate notice of this school bus driver permit sanction on the person and the sanction shall be effective on the 46th day following the date notice was given.
    In cases where the blood alcohol concentration of more than 0.00 is established by a subsequent analysis of blood, other bodily substance, or urine, the police officer or arresting agency shall give notice as provided in this Section or by deposit in the United States mail of that notice in an envelope with postage prepaid and addressed to that person at his or her last known address and the loss of the school bus driver permit shall be effective on the 46th day following the date notice was given.
    Upon receipt of the sworn report of a law enforcement officer, the Secretary of State shall also give notice of the school bus driver permit sanction to the driver and the driver's current employer by mailing a notice of the effective date of the sanction to the individual. However, shall the sworn report be defective by not containing sufficient information or be completed in error, the notice of the school bus driver permit sanction may not be mailed to the person or his current employer or entered to the driving record, but rather the sworn report shall be returned to the issuing law enforcement agency.
    (e) A driver may contest this school bus driver permit sanction by requesting an administrative hearing with the Secretary of State in accordance with Section 2-118 of this Code. An individual whose blood alcohol concentration is shown to be more than 0.00 is not subject to this Section if he or she consumed alcohol in the performance of a religious service or ceremony. An individual whose blood alcohol concentration is shown to be more than 0.00 shall not be subject to this Section if the individual's blood alcohol concentration resulted only from ingestion of the prescribed or recommended dosage of medicine that contained alcohol. The petition for that hearing shall not stay or delay the effective date of the impending suspension. The scope of this hearing shall be limited to the issues of:
        (1) whether the police officer had probable cause to
    	
believe that the person was driving or in actual physical control of a school bus or any other vehicle owned or operated by or for a public or private school, or a school operated by a religious institution, when the vehicle is being used over a regularly scheduled route for the transportation of persons enrolled as students in grade 12 or below, in connection with any activity of the entities listed, upon the public highways of the State and the police officer had reason to believe that the person was in violation of any provision of this Code or a similar provision of a local ordinance; and
        (2) whether the person was issued a Uniform Traffic
    	
Ticket for any violation of this Code or a similar provision of a local ordinance; and
        (3) whether the police officer had probable cause to
    	
believe that the driver had consumed any amount of an alcoholic beverage based upon the driver's physical actions or other first-hand knowledge of the police officer; and
        (4) whether the person, after being advised by the
    	
officer that the privilege to possess a school bus driver permit would be canceled if the person refused to submit to and complete the test or tests, did refuse to submit to or complete the test or tests to determine the person's alcohol concentration; and
        (5) whether the person, after being advised by the
    	
officer that the privileges to possess a school bus driver permit would be canceled if the person submits to a chemical test or tests and the test or tests disclose an alcohol concentration of more than 0.00 and the person did submit to and complete the test or tests that determined an alcohol concentration of more than 0.00; and
        (6) whether the test result of an alcohol
    	
concentration of more than 0.00 was based upon the person's consumption of alcohol in the performance of a religious service or ceremony; and
        (7) whether the test result of an alcohol
    	
concentration of more than 0.00 was based upon the person's consumption of alcohol through ingestion of the prescribed or recommended dosage of medicine.
    The Secretary of State may adopt administrative rules setting forth circumstances under which the holder of a school bus driver permit is not required to appear in person at the hearing.
    Provided that the petitioner may subpoena the officer, the hearing may be conducted upon a review of the law enforcement officer's own official reports. Failure of the officer to answer the subpoena shall be grounds for a continuance if, in the hearing officer's discretion, the continuance is appropriate. At the conclusion of the hearing held under Section 2-118 of this Code, the Secretary of State may rescind, continue, or modify the school bus driver permit sanction.
    (f) The results of any chemical testing performed in accordance with subsection (a) of this Section are not admissible in any civil or criminal proceeding, except that the results of the testing may be considered at a hearing held under Section 2-118 of this Code. However, the results of the testing may not be used to impose driver's license sanctions under Section 11-501.1 of this Code. A law enforcement officer may, however, pursue a statutory summary suspension or revocation of driving privileges under Section 11-501.1 of this Code if other physical evidence or first hand knowledge forms the basis of that suspension or revocation.
    (g) This Section applies only to drivers who have been issued a school bus driver permit in accordance with Section 6-106.1 of this Code at the time of the issuance of the Uniform Traffic Ticket for a violation of this Code or a similar provision of a local ordinance, and a chemical test request is made under this Section.
    (h) The action of the Secretary of State in suspending, revoking, canceling, or denying any license, permit, registration, or certificate of title shall be subject to judicial review in the Circuit Court of Sangamon County or in the Circuit Court of Cook County, and the provisions of the Administrative Review Law and its rules are hereby adopted and shall apply to and govern every action for the judicial review of final acts or decisions of the Secretary of State under this Section.

public's health and safety.
    (b) The application of any person under the age of 18 years, and not legally emancipated, for a drivers license or permit to operate a motor vehicle issued under the laws of this State, shall be accompanied by the written consent of either parent of the applicant; otherwise by the guardian having custody of the applicant, or in the event there is no parent or guardian, then by another responsible adult. The written consent must accompany any application for a driver's license under this subsection (b), regardless of whether or not the required written consent also accompanied the person's previous application for an instruction permit.
    No graduated driver's license shall be issued to any applicant under 18 years of age, unless the applicant is at least 16 years of age and has:
        (1) Held a valid instruction permit for a minimum of

    (b-1) No graduated driver's license shall be issued to any applicant who is under 18 years of age and not legally emancipated, unless the applicant has graduated from a secondary school of this State or any other state, is enrolled in a course leading to a high school equivalency certificate, has obtained a high school equivalency certificate, is enrolled in an elementary or secondary school or college or university of this State or any other state and is not a chronic or habitual truant as provided in Section 26-2a of the School Code, or is receiving home instruction and submits proof of meeting any of those requirements at the time of application.
    An applicant under 18 years of age who provides proof acceptable to the Secretary that the applicant has resumed regular school attendance or home instruction or that his or her application was denied in error shall be eligible to receive a graduated license if other requirements are met. The Secretary shall adopt rules for implementing this subsection (b-1).
    (c) No graduated driver's license or permit shall be issued to any applicant under 18 years of age who has committed the offense of operating a motor vehicle without a valid license or permit in violation of Section 6-101 of this Code or a similar out of state offense and no graduated driver's license or permit shall be issued to any applicant under 18 years of age who has committed an offense that would otherwise result in a mandatory revocation of a license or permit as provided in Section 6-205 of this Code or who has been either convicted of or adjudicated a delinquent based upon a violation of the Cannabis Control Act, the Illinois Controlled Substances Act, the Use of Intoxicating Compounds Act, or the Methamphetamine Control and Community Protection Act while that individual was in actual physical control of a motor vehicle.

If a graduated driver's license holder committed an offense against traffic regulations governing the movement of vehicles or any violation of this Section or Section 12-603.1 of this Code during the first 12 months the license is held and subsequently is convicted of the violation, the provisions of this paragraph shall remain in effect until such time as a period of 6 consecutive months has elapsed without an additional violation and subsequent conviction of an offense against traffic regulations governing the movement of vehicles or any violation of this Section or Section 12-603.1 of this Code.
    (h) It shall be an offense for a person that is age 15, but under age 20, to be a passenger in a vehicle operated by a driver holding a graduated driver's license during the first 12 months the driver holds the license or until the driver reaches the age of 18, whichever occurs sooner, if another passenger under the age of 20 is present, excluding a sibling, step-sibling, child, or step-child of the driver.
    (i) No graduated driver's license shall be issued to any applicant under the age of 18 years if the applicant has been issued a traffic citation for which a disposition has not been rendered at the time of application.

The course shall be at least 6 hours in length and shall include instruction on traffic laws; highway signs, signals, and markings that regulate, warn, or direct traffic; and issues commonly associated with motor vehicle accidents including poor decision-making, risk taking, impaired driving, distraction, speed, failure to use a safety belt, driving at night, failure to yield the right-of-way, texting while driving, using wireless communication devices, and alcohol and drug awareness. The curriculum shall not require the operation of a motor vehicle.
    (b) The Secretary shall certify course providers. The requirements to be a certified course provider, the process for applying for certification, and the procedure for decertifying a course provider shall be established by rule.
    (b-5) In order to qualify for certification as an adult driver education course provider, each applicant must authorize an investigation that includes a fingerprint-based background check to determine if the applicant has ever been convicted of a criminal offense and, if so, the disposition of any conviction. This authorization shall indicate the scope of the inquiry and the agencies that may be contacted. Upon receiving this authorization, the Secretary of State may request and receive information and assistance from any federal, State, or local governmental agency as part of the authorized investigation. Each applicant shall submit his or her fingerprints to the Department of State Police in the form and manner prescribed by the Department of State Police. These fingerprints shall be checked against fingerprint records now and hereafter filed in the Department of State Police and Federal Bureau of Investigation criminal history record databases. The Department of State Police shall charge applicants a fee for conducting the criminal history record check, which shall be deposited into the State Police Services Fund and shall not exceed the actual cost of the State and national criminal history record check. The Department of State Police shall furnish, pursuant to positive identification, records of Illinois criminal convictions to the Secretary and shall forward the national criminal history record information to the Secretary. Applicants shall pay any other fingerprint-related fees. Unless otherwise prohibited by law, the information derived from the investigation, including the source of the information and any conclusions or recommendations derived from the information by the Secretary of State, shall be provided to the applicant upon request to the Secretary of State prior to any final action by the Secretary of State on the application. Any criminal conviction information obtained by the Secretary of State shall be confidential and may not be transmitted outside the Office of the Secretary of State, except as required by this subsection (b-5), and may not be transmitted to anyone within the Office of the Secretary of State except as needed for the purpose of evaluating the applicant.

The information obtained from the investigation may be maintained by the Secretary of State or any agency to which the information was transmitted. Only information and standards which bear a reasonable and rational relation to the performance of providing adult driver education shall be used by the Secretary of State. Any employee of the Secretary of State who gives or causes to be given away any confidential information concerning any criminal convictions or disposition of criminal convictions of an applicant shall be guilty of a Class A misdemeanor unless release of the information is authorized by this Section.
    (c) The Secretary may permit a course provider to offer the course online, if the Secretary is satisfied the course provider has established adequate procedures for verifying:
        (1) the identity of the person taking the course
    	
online; and
        (2) the person completes the entire course.
    (d) The Secretary shall establish a method of electronic verification of a student's successful completion of the course.
    (e) The fee charged by the course provider must bear a reasonable relationship to the cost of the course. The Secretary shall post on the Secretary of State's website a list of approved course providers, the fees charged by the providers, and contact information for each provider.
    (f) In addition to any other fee charged by the course provider, the course provider shall collect a fee of $5 from each student to offset the costs incurred by the Secretary in administering this program.

    Sec. 6-108. Cancellation of license issued to minor.
    (a) The Secretary of State shall cancel the license or permit of any minor under the age of 18 years in any of the following events:
        1. Upon the verified written request of the person
    	
who consented to the application of the minor that the license or permit be cancelled;
        2. Upon receipt of satisfactory evidence of the death
    	
of the person who consented to the application of the minor;
        3. Upon receipt of satisfactory evidence that the
    	
person who consented to the application of a minor no longer has legal custody of the minor;
        4. Upon receipt of information, submitted on a form
    	
prescribed by the Secretary of State under Section 26-3a of the School Code and provided voluntarily by nonpublic schools, that a license-holding minor no longer meets the school attendance requirements defined in Section 6-107 of this Code.
        A minor who provides proof acceptable to the
    	
Secretary that the minor has resumed regular school attendance or home instruction or that his or her license or permit was cancelled in error shall have his or her license reinstated. The Secretary shall adopt rules for implementing this subdivision (a)4;
        5. Upon determination by the Secretary that at the
    	
time of license issuance, the minor held an instruction permit and had a traffic citation for which a disposition had not been rendered.
    After cancellation, the Secretary of State shall not issue a new license or permit until the applicant meets the provisions of Section 6-107 of this Code.
    (b) The Secretary of State shall cancel the license or permit of any person under the age of 18 years if he or she is convicted of violating the Cannabis Control Act, the Illinois Controlled Substances Act, or the Methamphetamine Control and Community Protection Act while that person was in actual physical control of a motor vehicle. For purposes of this Section, any person placed on probation under Section 10 of the Cannabis Control Act, Section 410 of the Illinois Controlled Substances Act, or Section 70 of the Methamphetamine Control and Community Protection Act shall not be considered convicted. Any person found guilty of this offense, while in actual physical control of a motor vehicle, shall have an entry made in the court record by the judge that this offense did occur while the person was in actual physical control of a motor vehicle and order the clerk of the court to report the violation to the Secretary of State as such. After the cancellation, the Secretary of State shall not issue a new license or permit for a period of one year after the date of cancellation or until the minor attains the age of 18 years, whichever is longer. However, upon application, the Secretary of State may, if satisfied that the person applying will not endanger the public safety, or welfare, issue a restricted driving permit granting the privilege of driving a motor vehicle between the person's residence and person's place of employment or within the scope of the person's employment related duties, or to allow transportation for the person or a household member of the person's family for the receipt of necessary medical care or, if the professional evaluation indicates, provide transportation for the petitioner for alcohol remedial or rehabilitative activity, or for the person to attend classes, as a student, in an accredited educational institution; if the person is able to demonstrate that no alternative means of transportation is reasonably available; provided that the Secretary's discretion shall be limited to cases where undue hardship would result from a failure to issue such restricted driving permit. In each case the Secretary of State may issue a restricted driving permit for a period as he deems appropriate, except that the permit shall expire no later than 2 years from the date of issuance. A restricted driving permit issued hereunder shall be subject to cancellation, revocation, and suspension by the Secretary of State in like manner and for like cause as a driver's license issued hereunder may be cancelled, revoked, or suspended; except that a conviction upon one or more offenses against laws or ordinances regulating the movement of traffic shall be deemed sufficient cause for the revocation, suspension, or cancellation of a restricted driving permit. The Secretary of State may, as a condition to the issuance of a restricted driving permit, require the applicant to participate in a driver remedial or rehabilitative program. Thereafter, upon reapplication for a license as provided in Section 6-106 of this Code or a permit as provided in Section 6-105 of this Code and upon payment of the appropriate application fee, the Secretary of State shall issue the applicant a license as provided in Section 6-106 of this Code or shall issue the applicant a permit as provided in Section 6-105.

    (a-4) If an applicant for a driver's license or instruction permit has a current identification card issued by the Secretary of State, the Secretary may require the applicant to utilize the same residence address and name on the identification card, driver's license, and instruction permit records maintained by the Secretary.

To assist the State in identifying these veterans and delivering these vital services and benefits, the Secretary of State is authorized to issue drivers' licenses with the word "veteran" appearing on the face of the licenses. This authorization is predicated on the unique status of veterans. The Secretary may not issue any other driver's license which identifies an occupation, status, affiliation, hobby, or other unique characteristics of the license holder which is unrelated to the purpose of the driver's license.
    (e-5) Beginning on or before July 1, 2015, the Secretary of State shall designate a space on each original or renewal driver's license where, at the request of the applicant, the word "veteran" shall be placed.

    (a) The Secretary of State shall file every application for a license or permit accepted under this Chapter, and shall maintain suitable indexes thereof. The records of the Secretary of State shall indicate the action taken with respect to such applications.
    (b) The Secretary of State shall maintain appropriate records of all licenses and permits refused, cancelled, disqualified, revoked, or suspended and of the revocation, suspension, and disqualification of driving privileges of persons not licensed under this Chapter, and such records shall note the reasons for such action.
    (c) The Secretary of State shall maintain appropriate records of convictions reported under this Chapter. Records of conviction may be maintained in a computer processible medium.
    (d) The Secretary of State may also maintain appropriate records of any accident reports received.
    (e) The Secretary of State shall also maintain appropriate records of any disposition of supervision or records relative to a driver's referral to a driver remedial or rehabilitative program, as required by the Secretary of State or the courts.

issuance or renewal of a driver's license or identification card who is 16 years of age or older, the opportunity to have his or her name included in the First Person Consent organ and tissue donor registry. The Secretary must advise the applicant or licensee that he or she is under no compulsion to have his or her name included in the registry. An individual who agrees to having his or her name included in the First Person Consent organ and tissue donor registry has given full legal consent to the donation of any of his or her organs or tissue upon his or her death. A brochure explaining this method of executing an anatomical gift must be given to each applicant for issuance or renewal of a driver's license or identification card. The brochure must advise the applicant or licensee (i) that he or she is under no compulsion to have his or her name included in this registry and (ii) that he or she may wish to consult with family, friends, or clergy before doing so.
        (2) The Secretary of State may establish additional
    	
methods by which an individual may have his or her name included in the First Person Consent organ and tissue donor registry.
        (3) When an individual has agreed to have his or her
    	
name included in the First Person Consent organ and tissue donor registry, the Secretary of State shall note that agreement in the First Person consent organ and tissue donor registry. Representatives of federally designated organ procurement agencies and tissue banks and the offices of Illinois county coroners and medical examiners may inquire of the Secretary of State whether a potential organ donor's name is included in the First Person Consent organ and tissue donor registry, and the Secretary of State may provide that information to the representative.
        (4) An individual may withdraw his or her consent to
    	
be listed in the First Person Consent organ and tissue donor registry maintained by the Secretary of State by notifying the Secretary of State in writing, or by any other means approved by the Secretary, of the individual's decision to have his or her name removed from the registry.
        (5) The Secretary of State may undertake additional
    	
efforts, including education and awareness activities, to promote organ and tissue donation.
        (6) In the absence of gross negligence or willful
    	
misconduct, the Secretary of State and his or her employees are immune from any civil or criminal liability in connection with an individual's consent to be listed in the organ and tissue donor registry.

Upon a finding that a violation did occur, the individual whose information was used in violation of this Section is entitled to recover actual damages, but not less than liquidated damages in the amount of $250 for each violation, plus attorney's fees and the costs of bringing the action.
    (c) Use of information contained on a driver's license is not a violation of this Section if (i) the individual whose information has been used gave express permission for that use or (ii) the information relating to the individual was obtained from a source other than the individual's driver's license.
    (d) This Section does not apply to any agency of the United States, the State of Illinois, or any other state or political subdivision thereof.

If information is transferred to a third party under this subsection (e), it may be used only for the purposes authorized by this subsection (e).
    (f) This Section does not apply to the use of information obtained from a driver's license which has been provided by the holder of the license in the course of a potential or completed employment, commercial, business or professional transaction for the purpose of completing written documents including, but not limited to, contracts, agreements, purchase orders, retail installment contracts, buyer's orders, purchase contracts, repair orders, applications, disclosure forms or waiver forms.

    (a) The Secretary of State shall establish a database of the emergency contacts of persons who hold a driver's license, instruction permit, or any other type of driving permit issued by the Secretary of State.

Law enforcement officers may share information contained in the emergency contact database, including disabilities and special needs information, with other public safety workers on scene, as needed to conduct official law enforcement duties.
    (b) Any person holding a driver's license, instruction permit, or any other type of driving permit issued by the Secretary of State shall be afforded the opportunity to provide the Secretary of State, in a manner and form designated by the Secretary of State, the name, address, telephone number, and relationship to the holder of no more than 2 emergency contact persons whom the holder wishes to be contacted by a law enforcement officer if the holder is involved in a motor vehicle accident or other emergency situation and the holder is unable to communicate with the contact person or persons and may designate whether the holder has a disability or is a special needs individual. A contact person need not be the holder's next of kin.
    (c) The Secretary shall adopt rules to implement this Section. At a minimum, the rules shall address all of the following:
        (1) the method whereby a holder may provide the
    	
Secretary of State with emergency contact, disability, and special needs information;
        (2) the method whereby a holder may provide the
    	
Secretary of State with a change to the emergency contact, disability, and special needs information; and
        (3) any other aspect of the database or its operation
    	
that the Secretary determines is necessary to implement this Section.
    (d) If a person involved in a motor vehicle accident or other emergency situation is unable to communicate with the contact person or persons specified in the database, a law enforcement officer shall make a good faith effort to notify the contact person or persons of the situation. Neither the law enforcement officer nor the law enforcement agency that employs that law enforcement officer incurs any liability, however, if the law enforcement officer is not able to make contact with the contact person. Except for willful or wanton misconduct, neither the law enforcement officer, nor the law enforcement agency that employs the law enforcement officer, shall incur any liability relating to the reporting or use of the database during a motor vehicle accident or other emergency situation.
    (e) The Secretary of State shall make a good faith effort to maintain accurate data as provided by the driver's license or instruction permit holder and to provide that information to law enforcement as provided in subsection (a). The Secretary of State is not liable for any damages, costs, or expenses, including, without limitation, consequential damages, arising or resulting from any inaccurate or incomplete data or system unavailability. Except for willful or wanton misconduct, the Secretary of State shall not incur any liability relating to the reporting of disabilities or special needs individuals.
    (f) As used in this Section:
    "Disability" means an individual's physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of the major life activities; a record of such impairment; or when the individual is regarded as having such impairment.
    "Public safety worker" means a person employed by this State or a political subdivision thereof that provides firefighting, law enforcement, medical or other emergency services.
    "Special needs individuals" means those individuals who have or are at increased risk for a chronic physical, developmental, behavioral, or emotional condition and who also require health and related services of a type or amount beyond that required by individuals generally.

    Sec. 6-121. Issuance of confidential drivers' licenses.
    (a) Requirements for use of confidential drivers' licenses. Confidential drivers' licenses may be issued to local, state, and federal government agencies for bona fide law enforcement purposes. The drivers' licenses may be issued with fictitious names and addresses, and may be used only for confidential, investigative, or undercover law enforcement operations. Confidential drivers' licenses may be issued as REAL ID compliant or non-compliant driver's licenses.
    (b) Application procedures for confidential drivers' licenses:
        (1) Applications by local, state, and federal
    	
government agencies for confidential drivers' licenses must be made to the Secretary of State Police Department on a form and in a manner prescribed by the Secretary of State Police Department.
        (2) The application form must include information,
    	
as specific as possible without compromising investigations or techniques, setting forth the need for the drivers' licenses and the uses to which the licenses will be limited.
        (3) The application form must be signed and verified
    	
by the local, state, or federal government agency head or designee.
        (4) Registration information maintained by the
    	
Secretary of State Police Department for confidential drivers' licenses must show the fictitious names and addresses on all records subject to public disclosure. All other information concerning these confidential drivers' licenses are exempt from disclosure unless the disclosure is ordered by a court of competent jurisdiction.
    (c) Revocation and cancellation procedures for confidential drivers' licenses:
        (1) The Secretary of State Police Department may
    	
revoke or refuse to renew confidential drivers' licenses when they have reasonable cause to believe the licenses are being used for purposes other than those set forth in the application form or authorized by this Section. Confidential drivers' licenses may also be revoked where traffic violation citations have been issued to the driver and subsequent investigation reveals that the issuance of the citations was unrelated to the purposes for which the confidential driver's license was issued. In such cases, the citations and any resulting court orders, convictions, supervisions or other sanctions must be treated by the Secretary of State as though they were issued in relation to the true driver's license of the individual to whom the confidential driver's license was issued.
        (2) A government agency must request cancellation of
    	
confidential drivers' licenses that are no longer required for the purposes for which they were issued.
        (3) All revoked confidential drivers' licenses must
    	
be promptly returned to the Secretary of State Police Department by the government agency to which they were issued.

ARTICLE II. CANCELLATION, SUSPENSION, OR
REVOCATION OF LICENSES AND PERMITS

    (625 ILCS 5/6-201)
    Sec. 6-201. Authority to cancel licenses and permits.
    (a) The Secretary of State is authorized to cancel any license or permit upon determining that the holder thereof:
        1. was not entitled to the issuance thereof
    	
hereunder; or
        2. failed to give the required or correct information
    	
in his application; or
        3. failed to pay any fees owed to the Secretary of
    	
State under this Code for the license or permit; or
        4. committed any fraud in the making of such
    	
application; or
        5. is ineligible therefor under the provisions of
    	
Section 6-103 of this Act, as amended; or
        6. has refused or neglected to submit an alcohol,
    	
drug, and intoxicating compound evaluation or to submit to examination or re-examination as required under this Act; or
        7. has been convicted of violating the Cannabis
    	
Control Act, the Illinois Controlled Substances Act, the Methamphetamine Control and Community Protection Act, or the Use of Intoxicating Compounds Act while that individual was in actual physical control of a motor vehicle. For purposes of this Section, any person placed on probation under Section 10 of the Cannabis Control Act, Section 410 of the Illinois Controlled Substances Act, or Section 70 of the Methamphetamine Control and Community Protection Act shall not be considered convicted. Any person found guilty of this offense, while in actual physical control of a motor vehicle, shall have an entry made in the court record by the judge that this offense did occur while the person was in actual physical control of a motor vehicle and order the clerk of the court to report the violation to the Secretary of State as such. After the cancellation, the Secretary of State shall not issue a new license or permit for a period of one year after the date of cancellation. However, upon application, the Secretary of State may, if satisfied that the person applying will not endanger the public safety, or welfare, issue a restricted driving permit granting the privilege of driving a motor vehicle between the petitioner's residence and petitioner's place of employment or within the scope of the petitioner's employment related duties, or to allow transportation for the petitioner or a household member of the petitioner's family for the receipt of necessary medical care, or provide transportation for the petitioner to and from alcohol or drug remedial or rehabilitative activity recommended by a licensed service provider, or for the petitioner to attend classes, as a student, in an accredited educational institution. The petitioner must demonstrate that no alternative means of transportation is reasonably available; provided that the Secretary's discretion shall be limited to cases where undue hardship, as defined by the rules of the Secretary of State, would result from a failure to issue such restricted driving permit. In each case the Secretary of State may issue such restricted driving permit for such period as he deems appropriate, except that such permit shall expire no later than 2 years from the date of issuance. A restricted driving permit issued hereunder shall be subject to cancellation, revocation and suspension by the Secretary of State in like manner and for like cause as a driver's license issued hereunder may be cancelled, revoked or suspended; except that a conviction upon one or more offenses against laws or ordinances regulating the movement of traffic shall be deemed sufficient cause for the revocation, suspension or cancellation of a restricted driving permit. The Secretary of State may, as a condition to the issuance of a restricted driving permit, require the applicant to participate in a driver remedial or rehabilitative program. In accordance with 49 C.F.R. 384, the Secretary of State may not issue a restricted driving permit for the operation of a commercial motor vehicle to a person holding a CDL whose driving privileges have been revoked, suspended, cancelled, or disqualified under this Code; or
        8. failed to submit a report as required by Section
    	
6-116.5 of this Code; or
        9. has been convicted of a sex offense as defined in
    	
the Sex Offender Registration Act. The driver's license shall remain cancelled until the driver registers as a sex offender as required by the Sex Offender Registration Act, proof of the registration is furnished to the Secretary of State and the sex offender provides proof of current address to the Secretary; or
        10. is ineligible for a license or permit under
    	
Section 6-107, 6-107.1, or 6-108 of this Code; or
        11. refused or neglected to appear at a Driver
    	
Services facility to have the license or permit corrected and a new license or permit issued or to present documentation for verification of identity; or
        12. failed to submit a medical examiner's certificate
    	
or medical variance as required by 49 C.F.R. 383.71 or submitted a fraudulent medical examiner's certificate or medical variance; or
        13. has had his or her medical examiner's
    	
certificate, medical variance, or both removed or rescinded by the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration; or
        14. failed to self-certify as to the type of driving
    	
in which the CDL driver engages or expects to engage; or
        15. has submitted acceptable documentation indicating
    	
out-of-state residency to the Secretary of State to be released from the requirement of showing proof of financial responsibility in this State; or
        16. was convicted of fraud relating to the testing or
    	
issuance of a CDL or CLP, in which case only the CDL or CLP shall be cancelled. After cancellation, the Secretary shall not issue a CLP or CDL for a period of one year from the date of cancellation; or
        17. has a special restricted license under subsection
    	
(g) of Section 6-113 of this Code and failed to submit the required annual vision specialist report that the special restricted license holder's vision has not changed; or
        18. has a special restricted license under subsection
    	
(g) of Section 6-113 of this Code and was convicted or received court supervision for a violation of this Code that occurred during nighttime hours or was involved in a motor vehicle accident during nighttime hours in which the restricted license holder was at fault; or
        19. has assisted an out-of-state resident in
    	
acquiring an Illinois driver's license or identification card by providing or allowing the out-of-state resident to use his or her Illinois address of residence and is complicit in distributing and forwarding the Illinois driver's license or identification card to the out-of-state resident.
    (b) Upon such cancellation the licensee or permittee must surrender the license or permit so cancelled to the Secretary of State.
    (c) Except as provided in Sections 6-206.1 and 7-702.1, the Secretary of State shall have exclusive authority to grant, issue, deny, cancel, suspend and revoke driving privileges, drivers' licenses and restricted driving permits.
    (d) The Secretary of State may adopt rules to implement this Section.

apply to all violations stated in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subsection when the individual has been adjudicated under the Juvenile Court Act or the Juvenile Court Act of 1987. Such reporting requirements shall also apply to individuals adjudicated under the Juvenile Court Act or the Juvenile Court Act of 1987 who have committed a violation of Section 11-501 of this Code, or similar provision of a local ordinance, or Section 9-3 of the Criminal Code of 1961 or the Criminal Code of 2012, relating to the offense of reckless homicide, or Section 5-7 of the Snowmobile Registration and Safety Act or Section 5-16 of the Boat Registration and Safety Act, relating to the offense of operating a snowmobile or a watercraft while under the influence of alcohol, other drug or drugs, intoxicating compound or compounds, or combination thereof. These reporting requirements also apply to individuals adjudicated under the Juvenile Court Act of 1987 based on any offense determined to have been committed in furtherance of the criminal activities of an organized gang, as provided in Section 5-710 of that Act, if those activities involved the operation or use of a motor vehicle. It shall be the duty of the clerk of the court in which adjudication is had within 5 days thereafter to forward to the Secretary of State a report of the adjudication and the court order requiring the Secretary of State to suspend the minor's driver's license and driving privilege for such time as determined by the court, but only until he or she attains the age of 18 years. All juvenile court dispositions reported to the Secretary of State under this provision shall be processed by the Secretary of State as if the cases had been adjudicated in traffic or criminal court. However, information reported relative to the offense of reckless homicide, or Section 11-501 of this Code, or a similar provision of a local ordinance, shall be privileged and available only to the Secretary of State, courts, and police officers.
        The reporting requirements of this subsection (a)
    	
apply to all violations listed in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subsection (a), excluding parking violations, when the driver holds a CLP or CDL, regardless of the type of vehicle in which the violation occurred, or when any driver committed the violation in a commercial motor vehicle as defined in Section 6-500 of this Code.
        (3) Whenever an order is entered vacating the
    	
forfeiture of any bail, security or bond given to secure appearance for any offense under this Code or similar offenses under municipal ordinance, it shall be the duty of the clerk of the court in which such vacation was had or the judge of such court if such court has no clerk, within 5 days thereafter to forward to the Secretary of State a report of the vacation.
        (4) A report of any disposition of court supervision
    	
for a violation of Sections 6-303, 11-401, 11-501 or a similar provision of a local ordinance, 11-503, 11-504, and 11-506 of this Code, Section 5-7 of the Snowmobile Registration and Safety Act, and Section 5-16 of the Boat Registration and Safety Act shall be forwarded to the Secretary of State. A report of any disposition of court supervision for a violation of an offense defined as a serious traffic violation in this Code or a similar provision of a local ordinance committed by a person under the age of 21 years shall be forwarded to the Secretary of State.
        (5) Reports of conviction under this Code and
    	
sentencing hearings under the Juvenile Court Act of 1987 in an electronic format or a computer processible medium shall be forwarded to the Secretary of State via the Supreme Court in the form and format required by the Illinois Supreme Court and established by a written agreement between the Supreme Court and the Secretary of State. In counties with a population over 300,000, instead of forwarding reports to the Supreme Court, reports of conviction under this Code and sentencing hearings under the Juvenile Court Act of 1987 in an electronic format or a computer processible medium may be forwarded to the Secretary of State by the Circuit Court Clerk in a form and format required by the Secretary of State and established by written agreement between the Circuit Court Clerk and the Secretary of State. Failure to forward the reports of conviction or sentencing hearing under the Juvenile Court Act of 1987 as required by this Section shall be deemed an omission of duty and it shall be the duty of the several State's Attorneys to enforce the requirements of this Section.
    (b) Whenever a restricted driving permit is forwarded to a court, as a result of confiscation by a police officer pursuant to the authority in Section 6-113(f), it shall be the duty of the clerk, or judge, if the court has no clerk, to forward such restricted driving permit and a facsimile of the officer's citation to the Secretary of State as expeditiously as practicable.
    (c) For the purposes of this Code, a forfeiture of bail or collateral deposited to secure a defendant's appearance in court when forfeiture has not been vacated, or the failure of a defendant to appear for trial after depositing his driver's license in lieu of other bail, shall be equivalent to a conviction.
    (d) For the purpose of providing the Secretary of State with records necessary to properly monitor and assess driver performance and assist the courts in the proper disposition of repeat traffic law offenders, the clerk of the court shall forward to the Secretary of State, on a form prescribed by the Secretary, records of a driver's participation in a driver remedial or rehabilitative program which was required, through a court order or court supervision, in relation to the driver's arrest for a violation of Section 11-501 of this Code or a similar provision of a local ordinance. The clerk of the court shall also forward to the Secretary, either on paper or in an electronic format or a computer processible medium as required under paragraph (5) of subsection (a) of this Section, any disposition of court supervision for any traffic violation, excluding those offenses listed in paragraph (2) of subsection (a) of this Section. These reports shall be sent within 5 days after disposition, or, if the driver is referred to a driver remedial or rehabilitative program, within 5 days of the driver's referral to that program. These reports received by the Secretary of State, including those required to be forwarded under paragraph (a)(4), shall be privileged information, available only (i) to the affected driver, (ii) to the parent or guardian of a person under the age of 18 years holding an instruction permit or a graduated driver's license, and (iii) for use by the courts, police officers, prosecuting authorities, the Secretary of State, and the driver licensing administrator of any other state. In accordance with 49 C.F.R. Part 384, all reports of court supervision, except violations related to parking, shall be forwarded to the Secretary of State for all holders of a CLP or CDL or any driver who commits an offense while driving a commercial motor vehicle. These reports shall be recorded to the driver's record as a conviction for use in the disqualification of the driver's commercial motor vehicle privileges and shall not be privileged information.

        The reporting requirements of this subsection shall
    	
apply to all violations stated in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subsection when the individual has been adjudicated under the Juvenile Court Act or the Juvenile Court Act of 1987. Such reporting requirements shall also apply to individuals adjudicated under the Juvenile Court Act or the Juvenile Court Act of 1987 who have committed a violation of Section 11-501 of this Code, or similar provision of a local ordinance, or Section 9-3 of the Criminal Code of 1961 or the Criminal Code of 2012, relating to the offense of reckless homicide, or Section 5-7 of the Snowmobile Registration and Safety Act or Section 5-16 of the Boat Registration and Safety Act, relating to the offense of operating a snowmobile or a watercraft while under the influence of alcohol, other drug or drugs, intoxicating compound or compounds, or combination thereof. These reporting requirements also apply to individuals adjudicated under the Juvenile Court Act of 1987 based on any offense determined to have been committed in furtherance of the criminal activities of an organized gang, as provided in Section 5-710 of that Act, if those activities involved the operation or use of a motor vehicle. It shall be the duty of the clerk of the court in which adjudication is had within 5 days thereafter to forward to the Secretary of State a report of the adjudication and the court order requiring the Secretary of State to suspend the minor's driver's license and driving privilege for such time as determined by the court, but only until he or she attains the age of 18 years. All juvenile court dispositions reported to the Secretary of State under this provision shall be processed by the Secretary of State as if the cases had been adjudicated in traffic or criminal court. However, information reported relative to the offense of reckless homicide, or Section 11-501 of this Code, or a similar provision of a local ordinance, shall be privileged and available only to the Secretary of State, courts, and police officers.
        The reporting requirements of this subsection (a)
    	
apply to all violations listed in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subsection (a), excluding parking violations, when the driver holds a CLP or CDL, regardless of the type of vehicle in which the violation occurred, or when any driver committed the violation in a commercial motor vehicle as defined in Section 6-500 of this Code.
        (3) Whenever an order is entered vacating the
    	
conditions of pretrial release given to secure appearance for any offense under this Code or similar offenses under municipal ordinance, it shall be the duty of the clerk of the court in which such vacation was had or the judge of such court if such court has no clerk, within 5 days thereafter to forward to the Secretary of State a report of the vacation.
        (4) A report of any disposition of court supervision
    	
for a violation of Sections 6-303, 11-401, 11-501 or a similar provision of a local ordinance, 11-503, 11-504, and 11-506 of this Code, Section 5-7 of the Snowmobile Registration and Safety Act, and Section 5-16 of the Boat Registration and Safety Act shall be forwarded to the Secretary of State. A report of any disposition of court supervision for a violation of an offense defined as a serious traffic violation in this Code or a similar provision of a local ordinance committed by a person under the age of 21 years shall be forwarded to the Secretary of State.
        (5) Reports of conviction under this Code and
    	
sentencing hearings under the Juvenile Court Act of 1987 in an electronic format or a computer processible medium shall be forwarded to the Secretary of State via the Supreme Court in the form and format required by the Illinois Supreme Court and established by a written agreement between the Supreme Court and the Secretary of State. In counties with a population over 300,000, instead of forwarding reports to the Supreme Court, reports of conviction under this Code and sentencing hearings under the Juvenile Court Act of 1987 in an electronic format or a computer processible medium may be forwarded to the Secretary of State by the Circuit Court Clerk in a form and format required by the Secretary of State and established by written agreement between the Circuit Court Clerk and the Secretary of State. Failure to forward the reports of conviction or sentencing hearing under the Juvenile Court Act of 1987 as required by this Section shall be deemed an omission of duty and it shall be the duty of the several State's Attorneys to enforce the requirements of this Section.
    (b) Whenever a restricted driving permit is forwarded to a court, as a result of confiscation by a police officer pursuant to the authority in Section 6-113(f), it shall be the duty of the clerk, or judge, if the court has no clerk, to forward such restricted driving permit and a facsimile of the officer's citation to the Secretary of State as expeditiously as practicable.
    (c) For the purposes of this Code, a violation of the conditions of pretrial release when the conditions of pretrial release have not been vacated, or the failure of a defendant to appear for trial after depositing his driver's license in lieu of other bail, shall be equivalent to a conviction.
    (d) For the purpose of providing the Secretary of State with records necessary to properly monitor and assess driver performance and assist the courts in the proper disposition of repeat traffic law offenders, the clerk of the court shall forward to the Secretary of State, on a form prescribed by the Secretary, records of a driver's participation in a driver remedial or rehabilitative program which was required, through a court order or court supervision, in relation to the driver's arrest for a violation of Section 11-501 of this Code or a similar provision of a local ordinance. The clerk of the court shall also forward to the Secretary, either on paper or in an electronic format or a computer processible medium as required under paragraph (5) of subsection (a) of this Section, any disposition of court supervision for any traffic violation, excluding those offenses listed in paragraph (2) of subsection (a) of this Section. These reports shall be sent within 5 days after disposition, or, if the driver is referred to a driver remedial or rehabilitative program, within 5 days of the driver's referral to that program. These reports received by the Secretary of State, including those required to be forwarded under paragraph (a)(4), shall be privileged information, available only (i) to the affected driver, (ii) to the parent or guardian of a person under the age of 18 years holding an instruction permit or a graduated driver's license, and (iii) for use by the courts, police officers, prosecuting authorities, the Secretary of State, and the driver licensing administrator of any other state. In accordance with 49 C.F.R. Part 384, all reports of court supervision, except violations related to parking, shall be forwarded to the Secretary of State for all holders of a CLP or CDL or any driver who commits an offense while driving a commercial motor vehicle. These reports shall be recorded to the driver's record as a conviction for use in the disqualification of the driver's commercial motor vehicle privileges and shall not be privileged information.

        19. Violation of subsection (a) of Section 11-1414 of

    (b) The Secretary of State shall also immediately revoke the license or permit of any driver in the following situations:
        1. Of any minor upon receiving the notice provided

The revocation shall remain in effect for the period determined by the court.
    (c)(1) Whenever a person is convicted of any of the offenses enumerated in this Section, the court may recommend and the Secretary of State in his discretion, without regard to whether the recommendation is made by the court may, upon application, issue to the person a restricted driving permit granting the privilege of driving a motor vehicle between the petitioner's residence and petitioner's place of employment or within the scope of the petitioner's employment related duties, or to allow the petitioner to transport himself or herself or a family member of the petitioner's household to a medical facility for the receipt of necessary medical care or to allow the petitioner to transport himself or herself to and from alcohol or drug remedial or rehabilitative activity recommended by a licensed service provider, or to allow the petitioner to transport himself or herself or a family member of the petitioner's household to classes, as a student, at an accredited educational institution, or to allow the petitioner to transport children, elderly persons, or persons with disabilities who do not hold driving privileges and are living in the petitioner's household to and from daycare; if the petitioner is able to demonstrate that no alternative means of transportation is reasonably available and that the petitioner will not endanger the public safety or welfare; provided that the Secretary's discretion shall be limited to cases where undue hardship, as defined by the rules of the Secretary of State, would result from a failure to issue the restricted driving permit.
    (1.5) A person subject to the provisions of paragraph 4 of subsection (b) of Section 6-208 of this Code may make application for a restricted driving permit at a hearing conducted under Section 2-118 of this Code after the expiration of 5 years from the effective date of the most recent revocation, or after 5 years from the date of release from a period of imprisonment resulting from a conviction of the most recent offense, whichever is later, provided the person, in addition to all other requirements of the Secretary, shows by clear and convincing evidence:
        (A) a minimum of 3 years of uninterrupted
    	
abstinence from alcohol and the unlawful use or consumption of cannabis under the Cannabis Control Act, a controlled substance under the Illinois Controlled Substances Act, an intoxicating compound under the Use of Intoxicating Compounds Act, or methamphetamine under the Methamphetamine Control and Community Protection Act; and
        (B) the successful completion of any rehabilitative
    	
treatment and involvement in any ongoing rehabilitative activity that may be recommended by a properly licensed service provider according to an assessment of the person's alcohol or drug use under Section 11-501.01 of this Code.
    In determining whether an applicant is eligible for a restricted driving permit under this paragraph (1.5), the Secretary may consider any relevant evidence, including, but not limited to, testimony, affidavits, records, and the results of regular alcohol or drug tests. Persons subject to the provisions of paragraph 4 of subsection (b) of Section 6-208 of this Code and who have been convicted of more than one violation of paragraph (3), paragraph (4), or paragraph (5) of subsection (a) of Section 11-501 of this Code shall not be eligible to apply for a restricted driving permit.
    A restricted driving permit issued under this paragraph (1.5) shall provide that the holder may only operate motor vehicles equipped with an ignition interlock device as required under paragraph (2) of subsection (c) of this Section and subparagraph (A) of paragraph 3 of subsection (c) of Section 6-206 of this Code. The Secretary may revoke a restricted driving permit or amend the conditions of a restricted driving permit issued under this paragraph (1.5) if the holder operates a vehicle that is not equipped with an ignition interlock device, or for any other reason authorized under this Code.
    A restricted driving permit issued under this paragraph (1.5) shall be revoked, and the holder barred from applying for or being issued a restricted driving permit in the future, if the holder is subsequently convicted of a violation of Section 11-501 of this Code, a similar provision of a local ordinance, or a similar offense in another state.
    (2) If a person's license or permit is revoked or suspended due to 2 or more convictions of violating Section 11-501 of this Code or a similar provision of a local ordinance or a similar out-of-state offense, or Section 9-3 of the Criminal Code of 1961 or the Criminal Code of 2012, where the use of alcohol or other drugs is recited as an element of the offense, or a similar out-of-state offense, or a combination of these offenses, arising out of separate occurrences, that person, if issued a restricted driving permit, may not operate a vehicle unless it has been equipped with an ignition interlock device as defined in Section 1-129.1.
    (3) If:
        (A) a person's license or permit is revoked or
    	
suspended 2 or more times due to any combination of:
            (i) a single conviction of violating Section
        	
11-501 of this Code or a similar provision of a local ordinance or a similar out-of-state offense, or Section 9-3 of the Criminal Code of 1961 or the Criminal Code of 2012, where the use of alcohol or other drugs is recited as an element of the offense, or a similar out-of-state offense; or
            (ii) a statutory summary suspension or
        	
revocation under Section 11-501.1; or
            (iii) a suspension pursuant to Section 6-203.1;
    arising out of separate occurrences; or
        (B) a person has been convicted of one violation of
    	
subparagraph (C) or (F) of paragraph (1) of subsection (d) of Section 11-501 of this Code, Section 9-3 of the Criminal Code of 1961 or the Criminal Code of 2012, relating to the offense of reckless homicide where the use of alcohol or other drugs was recited as an element of the offense, or a similar provision of a law of another state;
that person, if issued a restricted driving permit, may not operate a vehicle unless it has been equipped with an ignition interlock device as defined in Section 1-129.1.
    (4) The person issued a permit conditioned on the use of an ignition interlock device must pay to the Secretary of State DUI Administration Fund an amount not to exceed $30 per month. The Secretary shall establish by rule the amount and the procedures, terms, and conditions relating to these fees.
    (5) If the restricted driving permit is issued for employment purposes, then the prohibition against operating a motor vehicle that is not equipped with an ignition interlock device does not apply to the operation of an occupational vehicle owned or leased by that person's employer when used solely for employment purposes. For any person who, within a 5-year period, is convicted of a second or subsequent offense under Section 11-501 of this Code, or a similar provision of a local ordinance or similar out-of-state offense, this employment exemption does not apply until either a one-year period has elapsed during which that person had his or her driving privileges revoked or a one-year period has elapsed during which that person had a restricted driving permit which required the use of an ignition interlock device on every motor vehicle owned or operated by that person.
    (6) In each case the Secretary of State may issue a restricted driving permit for a period he deems appropriate, except that the permit shall expire no later than 2 years from the date of issuance. A restricted driving permit issued under this Section shall be subject to cancellation, revocation, and suspension by the Secretary of State in like manner and for like cause as a driver's license issued under this Code may be cancelled, revoked, or suspended; except that a conviction upon one or more offenses against laws or ordinances regulating the movement of traffic shall be deemed sufficient cause for the revocation, suspension, or cancellation of a restricted driving permit. The Secretary of State may, as a condition to the issuance of a restricted driving permit, require the petitioner to participate in a designated driver remedial or rehabilitative program. The Secretary of State is authorized to cancel a restricted driving permit if the permit holder does not successfully complete the program. However, if an individual's driving privileges have been revoked in accordance with paragraph 13 of subsection (a) of this Section, no restricted driving permit shall be issued until the individual has served 6 months of the revocation period.
    (c-5) (Blank).
    (c-6) If a person is convicted of a second violation of operating a motor vehicle while the person's driver's license, permit or privilege was revoked, where the revocation was for a violation of Section 9-3 of the Criminal Code of 1961 or the Criminal Code of 2012 relating to the offense of reckless homicide or a similar out-of-state offense, the person's driving privileges shall be revoked pursuant to subdivision (a)(15) of this Section. The person may not make application for a license or permit until the expiration of five years from the effective date of the revocation or the expiration of five years from the date of release from a term of imprisonment, whichever is later.
    (c-7) If a person is convicted of a third or subsequent violation of operating a motor vehicle while the person's driver's license, permit or privilege was revoked, where the revocation was for a violation of Section 9-3 of the Criminal Code of 1961 or the Criminal Code of 2012 relating to the offense of reckless homicide or a similar out-of-state offense, the person may never apply for a license or permit.
    (d)(1) Whenever a person under the age of 21 is convicted under Section 11-501 of this Code or a similar provision of a local ordinance or a similar out-of-state offense, the Secretary of State shall revoke the driving privileges of that person. One year after the date of revocation, and upon application, the Secretary of State may, if satisfied that the person applying will not endanger the public safety or welfare, issue a restricted driving permit granting the privilege of driving a motor vehicle only between the hours of 5 a.m. and 9 p.m. or as otherwise provided by this Section for a period of one year. After this one-year period, and upon reapplication for a license as provided in Section 6-106, upon payment of the appropriate reinstatement fee provided under paragraph (b) of Section 6-118, the Secretary of State, in his discretion, may reinstate the petitioner's driver's license and driving privileges, or extend the restricted driving permit as many times as the Secretary of State deems appropriate, by additional periods of not more than 24 months each.
        (2) If a person's license or permit is revoked or
    	
suspended due to 2 or more convictions of violating Section 11-501 of this Code or a similar provision of a local ordinance or a similar out-of-state offense, or Section 9-3 of the Criminal Code of 1961 or the Criminal Code of 2012, where the use of alcohol or other drugs is recited as an element of the offense, or a similar out-of-state offense, or a combination of these offenses, arising out of separate occurrences, that person, if issued a restricted driving permit, may not operate a vehicle unless it has been equipped with an ignition interlock device as defined in Section 1-129.1.
        (3) If a person's license or permit is revoked or
    	
suspended 2 or more times due to any combination of:
            (A) a single conviction of violating Section
        	
11-501 of this Code or a similar provision of a local ordinance or a similar out-of-state offense, or Section 9-3 of the Criminal Code of 1961 or the Criminal Code of 2012, where the use of alcohol or other drugs is recited as an element of the offense, or a similar out-of-state offense; or
            (B) a statutory summary suspension or revocation
        	
under Section 11-501.1; or
            (C) a suspension pursuant to Section 6-203.1;
    arising out of separate occurrences, that person, if
    	
issued a restricted driving permit, may not operate a vehicle unless it has been equipped with an ignition interlock device as defined in Section 1-129.1.
        (3.5) If a person's license or permit is revoked or
    	
suspended due to a conviction for a violation of subparagraph (C) or (F) of paragraph (1) of subsection (d) of Section 11-501 of this Code, or a similar provision of a local ordinance or similar out-of-state offense, that person, if issued a restricted driving permit, may not operate a vehicle unless it has been equipped with an ignition interlock device as defined in Section 1-129.1.
        (4) The person issued a permit conditioned upon the
    	
use of an interlock device must pay to the Secretary of State DUI Administration Fund an amount not to exceed $30 per month. The Secretary shall establish by rule the amount and the procedures, terms, and conditions relating to these fees.
        (5) If the restricted driving permit is issued for
    	
employment purposes, then the prohibition against driving a vehicle that is not equipped with an ignition interlock device does not apply to the operation of an occupational vehicle owned or leased by that person's employer when used solely for employment purposes. For any person who, within a 5-year period, is convicted of a second or subsequent offense under Section 11-501 of this Code, or a similar provision of a local ordinance or similar out-of-state offense, this employment exemption does not apply until either a one-year period has elapsed during which that person had his or her driving privileges revoked or a one-year period has elapsed during which that person had a restricted driving permit which required the use of an ignition interlock device on every motor vehicle owned or operated by that person.
        (6) A restricted driving permit issued under this
    	
Section shall be subject to cancellation, revocation, and suspension by the Secretary of State in like manner and for like cause as a driver's license issued under this Code may be cancelled, revoked, or suspended; except that a conviction upon one or more offenses against laws or ordinances regulating the movement of traffic shall be deemed sufficient cause for the revocation, suspension, or cancellation of a restricted driving permit.
    (d-5) The revocation of the license, permit, or driving privileges of a person convicted of a third or subsequent violation of Section 6-303 of this Code committed while his or her driver's license, permit, or privilege was revoked because of a violation of Section 9-3 of the Criminal Code of 1961 or the Criminal Code of 2012, relating to the offense of reckless homicide, or a similar provision of a law of another state, is permanent. The Secretary may not, at any time, issue a license or permit to that person.
    (e) This Section is subject to the provisions of the Driver License Compact.

If the conviction is affirmed on appeal, the date of the conviction shall relate back to the time the original judgment of conviction was entered and the 6 month limitation prescribed shall not apply.

The affidavit shall be accompanied by the driver's license. Upon receipt of a properly completed affidavit, the Secretary of State shall issue the driver a permit to operate a vehicle in connection with the driver's regular occupation only.

If an affidavit is received subsequent to the effective date of this suspension, a permit may be issued for the remainder of the suspension period.
    The provisions of this subparagraph shall not apply to any driver required to possess a CDL for the purpose of operating a commercial motor vehicle.

If the Secretary of State does not rescind the order, the Secretary may upon application, to relieve undue hardship (as defined by the rules of the Secretary of State), issue a restricted driving permit granting the privilege of driving a motor vehicle between the petitioner's residence and petitioner's place of employment or within the scope of the petitioner's employment related duties, or to allow the petitioner to transport himself or herself, or a family member of the petitioner's household to a medical facility, to receive necessary medical care, to allow the petitioner to transport himself or herself to and from alcohol or drug remedial or rehabilitative activity recommended by a licensed service provider, or to allow the petitioner to transport himself or herself or a family member of the petitioner's household to classes, as a student, at an accredited educational institution, or to allow the petitioner to transport children, elderly persons, or persons with disabilities who do not hold driving privileges and are living in the petitioner's household to and from daycare. The petitioner must demonstrate that no alternative means of transportation is reasonably available and that the petitioner will not endanger the public safety or welfare.
        (A) If a person's license or permit is revoked or
    	
suspended due to 2 or more convictions of violating Section 11-501 of this Code or a similar provision of a local ordinance or a similar out-of-state offense, or Section 9-3 of the Criminal Code of 1961 or the Criminal Code of 2012, where the use of alcohol or other drugs is recited as an element of the offense, or a similar out-of-state offense, or a combination of these offenses, arising out of separate occurrences, that person, if issued a restricted driving permit, may not operate a vehicle unless it has been equipped with an ignition interlock device as defined in Section 1-129.1.
        (B) If a person's license or permit is revoked or
    	
suspended 2 or more times due to any combination of:
            (i) a single conviction of violating Section
        	
11-501 of this Code or a similar provision of a local ordinance or a similar out-of-state offense or Section 9-3 of the Criminal Code of 1961 or the Criminal Code of 2012, where the use of alcohol or other drugs is recited as an element of the offense, or a similar out-of-state offense; or
            (ii) a statutory summary suspension or revocation
        	
under Section 11-501.1; or
            (iii) a suspension under Section 6-203.1;
    arising out of separate occurrences; that person, if
    	
issued a restricted driving permit, may not operate a vehicle unless it has been equipped with an ignition interlock device as defined in Section 1-129.1.
        (B-5) If a person's license or permit is revoked
    	
or suspended due to a conviction for a violation of subparagraph (C) or (F) of paragraph (1) of subsection (d) of Section 11-501 of this Code, or a similar provision of a local ordinance or similar out-of-state offense, that person, if issued a restricted driving permit, may not operate a vehicle unless it has been equipped with an ignition interlock device as defined in Section 1-129.1.
        (C) The person issued a permit conditioned upon the
    	
use of an ignition interlock device must pay to the Secretary of State DUI Administration Fund an amount not to exceed $30 per month. The Secretary shall establish by rule the amount and the procedures, terms, and conditions relating to these fees.
        (D) If the restricted driving permit is issued for
    	
employment purposes, then the prohibition against operating a motor vehicle that is not equipped with an ignition interlock device does not apply to the operation of an occupational vehicle owned or leased by that person's employer when used solely for employment purposes. For any person who, within a 5-year period, is convicted of a second or subsequent offense under Section 11-501 of this Code, or a similar provision of a local ordinance or similar out-of-state offense, this employment exemption does not apply until either a one-year period has elapsed during which that person had his or her driving privileges revoked or a one-year period has elapsed during which that person had a restricted driving permit which required the use of an ignition interlock device on every motor vehicle owned or operated by that person.
        (E) In each case the Secretary may issue a
    	
restricted driving permit for a period deemed appropriate, except that all permits shall expire no later than 2 years from the date of issuance. A restricted driving permit issued under this Section shall be subject to cancellation, revocation, and suspension by the Secretary of State in like manner and for like cause as a driver's license issued under this Code may be cancelled, revoked, or suspended; except that a conviction upon one or more offenses against laws or ordinances regulating the movement of traffic shall be deemed sufficient cause for the revocation, suspension, or cancellation of a restricted driving permit. The Secretary of State may, as a condition to the issuance of a restricted driving permit, require the applicant to participate in a designated driver remedial or rehabilitative program. The Secretary of State is authorized to cancel a restricted driving permit if the permit holder does not successfully complete the program.
        (F) A person subject to the provisions of paragraph 4
    	
of subsection (b) of Section 6-208 of this Code may make application for a restricted driving permit at a hearing conducted under Section 2-118 of this Code after the expiration of 5 years from the effective date of the most recent revocation or after 5 years from the date of release from a period of imprisonment resulting from a conviction of the most recent offense, whichever is later, provided the person, in addition to all other requirements of the Secretary, shows by clear and convincing evidence:
            (i) a minimum of 3 years of uninterrupted
        	
abstinence from alcohol and the unlawful use or consumption of cannabis under the Cannabis Control Act, a controlled substance under the Illinois Controlled Substances Act, an intoxicating compound under the Use of Intoxicating Compounds Act, or methamphetamine under the Methamphetamine Control and Community Protection Act; and
            (ii) the successful completion of any
        	
rehabilitative treatment and involvement in any ongoing rehabilitative activity that may be recommended by a properly licensed service provider according to an assessment of the person's alcohol or drug use under Section 11-501.01 of this Code.
        In determining whether an applicant is eligible for a
    	
restricted driving permit under this subparagraph (F), the Secretary may consider any relevant evidence, including, but not limited to, testimony, affidavits, records, and the results of regular alcohol or drug tests. Persons subject to the provisions of paragraph 4 of subsection (b) of Section 6-208 of this Code and who have been convicted of more than one violation of paragraph (3), paragraph (4), or paragraph (5) of subsection (a) of Section 11-501 of this Code shall not be eligible to apply for a restricted driving permit under this subparagraph (F).
        A restricted driving permit issued under this
    	
subparagraph (F) shall provide that the holder may only operate motor vehicles equipped with an ignition interlock device as required under paragraph (2) of subsection (c) of Section 6-205 of this Code and subparagraph (A) of paragraph 3 of subsection (c) of this Section. The Secretary may revoke a restricted driving permit or amend the conditions of a restricted driving permit issued under this subparagraph (F) if the holder operates a vehicle that is not equipped with an ignition interlock device, or for any other reason authorized under this Code.
        A restricted driving permit issued under this
    	
subparagraph (F) shall be revoked, and the holder barred from applying for or being issued a restricted driving permit in the future, if the holder is convicted of a violation of Section 11-501 of this Code, a similar provision of a local ordinance, or a similar offense in another state.
    (c-3) In the case of a suspension under paragraph 43 of subsection (a), reports received by the Secretary of State under this Section shall, except during the actual time the suspension is in effect, be privileged information and for use only by the courts, police officers, prosecuting authorities, the driver licensing administrator of any other state, the Secretary of State, or the parent or legal guardian of a driver under the age of 18. However, beginning January 1, 2008, if the person is a CDL holder, the suspension shall also be made available to the driver licensing administrator of any other state, the U.S. Department of Transportation, and the affected driver or motor carrier or prospective motor carrier upon request.
    (c-4) In the case of a suspension under paragraph 43 of subsection (a), the Secretary of State shall notify the person by mail that his or her driving privileges and driver's license will be suspended one month after the date of the mailing of the notice.
    (c-5) The Secretary of State may, as a condition of the reissuance of a driver's license or permit to an applicant whose driver's license or permit has been suspended before he or she reached the age of 21 years pursuant to any of the provisions of this Section, require the applicant to participate in a driver remedial education course and be retested under Section 6-109 of this Code.
    (d) This Section is subject to the provisions of the Drivers License Compact.
    (e) The Secretary of State shall not issue a restricted driving permit to a person under the age of 16 years whose driving privileges have been suspended or revoked under any provisions of this Code.
    (f) In accordance with 49 C.F.R. 384, the Secretary of State may not issue a restricted driving permit for the operation of a commercial motor vehicle to a person holding a CDL whose driving privileges have been suspended, revoked, cancelled, or disqualified under any provisions of this Code.

If the conviction is affirmed on appeal, the date of the conviction shall relate back to the time the original judgment of conviction was entered and the 6 month limitation prescribed shall not apply.
    (c) 1. Upon suspending or revoking the driver's license or permit of any person as authorized in this Section, the Secretary of State shall immediately notify the person in writing of the revocation or suspension. The notice to be deposited in the United States mail, postage prepaid, to the last known address of the person.
    2. If the Secretary of State suspends the driver's license of a person under subsection 2 of paragraph (a) of this Section, a person's privilege to operate a vehicle as an occupation shall not be suspended, provided an affidavit is properly completed, the appropriate fee received, and a permit issued prior to the effective date of the suspension, unless 5 offenses were committed, at least 2 of which occurred while operating a commercial vehicle in connection with the driver's regular occupation.

If an affidavit is received subsequent to the effective date of this suspension, a permit may be issued for the remainder of the suspension period.
    The provisions of this subparagraph shall not apply to any driver required to possess a CDL for the purpose of operating a commercial motor vehicle.

If the Secretary of State does not rescind the order, the Secretary may upon application, to relieve undue hardship (as defined by the rules of the Secretary of State), issue a restricted driving permit granting the privilege of driving a motor vehicle between the petitioner's residence and petitioner's place of employment or within the scope of the petitioner's employment related duties, or to allow the petitioner to transport himself or herself, or a family member of the petitioner's household to a medical facility, to receive necessary medical care, to allow the petitioner to transport himself or herself to and from alcohol or drug remedial or rehabilitative activity recommended by a licensed service provider, or to allow the petitioner to transport himself or herself or a family member of the petitioner's household to classes, as a student, at an accredited educational institution, or to allow the petitioner to transport children, elderly persons, or persons with disabilities who do not hold driving privileges and are living in the petitioner's household to and from daycare. The petitioner must demonstrate that no alternative means of transportation is reasonably available and that the petitioner will not endanger the public safety or welfare.
        (A) If a person's license or permit is revoked or
    	
suspended due to 2 or more convictions of violating Section 11-501 of this Code or a similar provision of a local ordinance or a similar out-of-state offense, or Section 9-3 of the Criminal Code of 1961 or the Criminal Code of 2012, where the use of alcohol or other drugs is recited as an element of the offense, or a similar out-of-state offense, or a combination of these offenses, arising out of separate occurrences, that person, if issued a restricted driving permit, may not operate a vehicle unless it has been equipped with an ignition interlock device as defined in Section 1-129.1.
        (B) If a person's license or permit is revoked or
    	
suspended 2 or more times due to any combination of:
            (i) a single conviction of violating Section
        	
11-501 of this Code or a similar provision of a local ordinance or a similar out-of-state offense or Section 9-3 of the Criminal Code of 1961 or the Criminal Code of 2012, where the use of alcohol or other drugs is recited as an element of the offense, or a similar out-of-state offense; or
            (ii) a statutory summary suspension or revocation
        	
under Section 11-501.1; or
            (iii) a suspension under Section 6-203.1;
    arising out of separate occurrences; that person, if
    	
issued a restricted driving permit, may not operate a vehicle unless it has been equipped with an ignition interlock device as defined in Section 1-129.1.
        (B-5) If a person's license or permit is revoked
    	
or suspended due to a conviction for a violation of subparagraph (C) or (F) of paragraph (1) of subsection (d) of Section 11-501 of this Code, or a similar provision of a local ordinance or similar out-of-state offense, that person, if issued a restricted driving permit, may not operate a vehicle unless it has been equipped with an ignition interlock device as defined in Section 1-129.1.
        (C) The person issued a permit conditioned upon the
    	
use of an ignition interlock device must pay to the Secretary of State DUI Administration Fund an amount not to exceed $30 per month. The Secretary shall establish by rule the amount and the procedures, terms, and conditions relating to these fees.
        (D) If the restricted driving permit is issued for
    	
employment purposes, then the prohibition against operating a motor vehicle that is not equipped with an ignition interlock device does not apply to the operation of an occupational vehicle owned or leased by that person's employer when used solely for employment purposes. For any person who, within a 5-year period, is convicted of a second or subsequent offense under Section 11-501 of this Code, or a similar provision of a local ordinance or similar out-of-state offense, this employment exemption does not apply until either a one-year period has elapsed during which that person had his or her driving privileges revoked or a one-year period has elapsed during which that person had a restricted driving permit which required the use of an ignition interlock device on every motor vehicle owned or operated by that person.
        (E) In each case the Secretary may issue a
    	
restricted driving permit for a period deemed appropriate, except that all permits shall expire no later than 2 years from the date of issuance. A restricted driving permit issued under this Section shall be subject to cancellation, revocation, and suspension by the Secretary of State in like manner and for like cause as a driver's license issued under this Code may be cancelled, revoked, or suspended; except that a conviction upon one or more offenses against laws or ordinances regulating the movement of traffic shall be deemed sufficient cause for the revocation, suspension, or cancellation of a restricted driving permit. The Secretary of State may, as a condition to the issuance of a restricted driving permit, require the applicant to participate in a designated driver remedial or rehabilitative program. The Secretary of State is authorized to cancel a restricted driving permit if the permit holder does not successfully complete the program.
        (F) A person subject to the provisions of paragraph 4
    	
of subsection (b) of Section 6-208 of this Code may make application for a restricted driving permit at a hearing conducted under Section 2-118 of this Code after the expiration of 5 years from the effective date of the most recent revocation or after 5 years from the date of release from a period of imprisonment resulting from a conviction of the most recent offense, whichever is later, provided the person, in addition to all other requirements of the Secretary, shows by clear and convincing evidence:
            (i) a minimum of 3 years of uninterrupted
        	
abstinence from alcohol and the unlawful use or consumption of cannabis under the Cannabis Control Act, a controlled substance under the Illinois Controlled Substances Act, an intoxicating compound under the Use of Intoxicating Compounds Act, or methamphetamine under the Methamphetamine Control and Community Protection Act; and
            (ii) the successful completion of any
        	
rehabilitative treatment and involvement in any ongoing rehabilitative activity that may be recommended by a properly licensed service provider according to an assessment of the person's alcohol or drug use under Section 11-501.01 of this Code.
        In determining whether an applicant is eligible for a
    	
restricted driving permit under this subparagraph (F), the Secretary may consider any relevant evidence, including, but not limited to, testimony, affidavits, records, and the results of regular alcohol or drug tests. Persons subject to the provisions of paragraph 4 of subsection (b) of Section 6-208 of this Code and who have been convicted of more than one violation of paragraph (3), paragraph (4), or paragraph (5) of subsection (a) of Section 11-501 of this Code shall not be eligible to apply for a restricted driving permit under this subparagraph (F).
        A restricted driving permit issued under this
    	
subparagraph (F) shall provide that the holder may only operate motor vehicles equipped with an ignition interlock device as required under paragraph (2) of subsection (c) of Section 6-205 of this Code and subparagraph (A) of paragraph 3 of subsection (c) of this Section. The Secretary may revoke a restricted driving permit or amend the conditions of a restricted driving permit issued under this subparagraph (F) if the holder operates a vehicle that is not equipped with an ignition interlock device, or for any other reason authorized under this Code.
        A restricted driving permit issued under this
    	
subparagraph (F) shall be revoked, and the holder barred from applying for or being issued a restricted driving permit in the future, if the holder is convicted of a violation of Section 11-501 of this Code, a similar provision of a local ordinance, or a similar offense in another state.
    (c-3) In the case of a suspension under paragraph 43 of subsection (a), reports received by the Secretary of State under this Section shall, except during the actual time the suspension is in effect, be privileged information and for use only by the courts, police officers, prosecuting authorities, the driver licensing administrator of any other state, the Secretary of State, or the parent or legal guardian of a driver under the age of 18. However, beginning January 1, 2008, if the person is a CDL holder, the suspension shall also be made available to the driver licensing administrator of any other state, the U.S. Department of Transportation, and the affected driver or motor carrier or prospective motor carrier upon request.
    (c-4) In the case of a suspension under paragraph 43 of subsection (a), the Secretary of State shall notify the person by mail that his or her driving privileges and driver's license will be suspended one month after the date of the mailing of the notice.
    (c-5) The Secretary of State may, as a condition of the reissuance of a driver's license or permit to an applicant whose driver's license or permit has been suspended before he or she reached the age of 21 years pursuant to any of the provisions of this Section, require the applicant to participate in a driver remedial education course and be retested under Section 6-109 of this Code.
    (d) This Section is subject to the provisions of the Drivers License Compact.
    (e) The Secretary of State shall not issue a restricted driving permit to a person under the age of 16 years whose driving privileges have been suspended or revoked under any provisions of this Code.
    (f) In accordance with 49 C.F.R. 384, the Secretary of State may not issue a restricted driving permit for the operation of a commercial motor vehicle to a person holding a CDL whose driving privileges have been suspended, revoked, cancelled, or disqualified under any provisions of this Code.

If the conviction is affirmed on appeal, the date of the conviction shall relate back to the time the original judgment of conviction was entered and the 6 month limitation prescribed shall not apply.

The petitioner must demonstrate that no alternative means of transportation is reasonably available and that the petitioner will not endanger the public safety or welfare.
        (A) If a person's license or permit is revoked or
    	
suspended due to 2 or more convictions of violating Section 11-501 of this Code or a similar provision of a local ordinance or a similar out-of-state offense, or Section 9-3 of the Criminal Code of 1961 or the Criminal Code of 2012, where the use of alcohol or other drugs is recited as an element of the offense, or a similar out-of-state offense, or a combination of these offenses, arising out of separate occurrences, that person, if issued a restricted driving permit, may not operate a vehicle unless it has been equipped with an ignition interlock device as defined in Section 1-129.1.
        (B) If a person's license or permit is revoked or
    	
suspended 2 or more times due to any combination of:
            (i) a single conviction of violating Section
        	
11-501 of this Code or a similar provision of a local ordinance or a similar out-of-state offense or Section 9-3 of the Criminal Code of 1961 or the Criminal Code of 2012, where the use of alcohol or other drugs is recited as an element of the offense, or a similar out-of-state offense; or
            (ii) a statutory summary suspension or revocation
        	
under Section 11-501.1; or
            (iii) a suspension under Section 6-203.1;
    arising out of separate occurrences; that person, if
    	
issued a restricted driving permit, may not operate a vehicle unless it has been equipped with an ignition interlock device as defined in Section 1-129.1.
        (B-5) If a person's license or permit is revoked
    	
or suspended due to a conviction for a violation of subparagraph (C) or (F) of paragraph (1) of subsection (d) of Section 11-501 of this Code, or a similar provision of a local ordinance or similar out-of-state offense, that person, if issued a restricted driving permit, may not operate a vehicle unless it has been equipped with an ignition interlock device as defined in Section 1-129.1.
        (C) The person issued a permit conditioned upon the
    	
use of an ignition interlock device must pay to the Secretary of State DUI Administration Fund an amount not to exceed $30 per month. The Secretary shall establish by rule the amount and the procedures, terms, and conditions relating to these fees.
        (D) If the restricted driving permit is issued for
    	
employment purposes, then the prohibition against operating a motor vehicle that is not equipped with an ignition interlock device does not apply to the operation of an occupational vehicle owned or leased by that person's employer when used solely for employment purposes. For any person who, within a 5-year period, is convicted of a second or subsequent offense under Section 11-501 of this Code, or a similar provision of a local ordinance or similar out-of-state offense, this employment exemption does not apply until either a one-year period has elapsed during which that person had his or her driving privileges revoked or a one-year period has elapsed during which that person had a restricted driving permit which required the use of an ignition interlock device on every motor vehicle owned or operated by that person.
        (E) In each case the Secretary may issue a
    	
restricted driving permit for a period deemed appropriate, except that all permits shall expire no later than 2 years from the date of issuance. A restricted driving permit issued under this Section shall be subject to cancellation, revocation, and suspension by the Secretary of State in like manner and for like cause as a driver's license issued under this Code may be cancelled, revoked, or suspended; except that a conviction upon one or more offenses against laws or ordinances regulating the movement of traffic shall be deemed sufficient cause for the revocation, suspension, or cancellation of a restricted driving permit. The Secretary of State may, as a condition to the issuance of a restricted driving permit, require the applicant to participate in a designated driver remedial or rehabilitative program. The Secretary of State is authorized to cancel a restricted driving permit if the permit holder does not successfully complete the program.
        (F) A person subject to the provisions of paragraph 4
    	
of subsection (b) of Section 6-208 of this Code may make application for a restricted driving permit at a hearing conducted under Section 2-118 of this Code after the expiration of 5 years from the effective date of the most recent revocation or after 5 years from the date of release from a period of imprisonment resulting from a conviction of the most recent offense, whichever is later, provided the person, in addition to all other requirements of the Secretary, shows by clear and convincing evidence:
            (i) a minimum of 3 years of uninterrupted
        	
abstinence from alcohol and the unlawful use or consumption of cannabis under the Cannabis Control Act, a controlled substance under the Illinois Controlled Substances Act, an intoxicating compound under the Use of Intoxicating Compounds Act, or methamphetamine under the Methamphetamine Control and Community Protection Act; and
            (ii) the successful completion of any
        	
rehabilitative treatment and involvement in any ongoing rehabilitative activity that may be recommended by a properly licensed service provider according to an assessment of the person's alcohol or drug use under Section 11-501.01 of this Code.
        In determining whether an applicant is eligible for a
    	
restricted driving permit under this subparagraph (F), the Secretary may consider any relevant evidence, including, but not limited to, testimony, affidavits, records, and the results of regular alcohol or drug tests. Persons subject to the provisions of paragraph 4 of subsection (b) of Section 6-208 of this Code and who have been convicted of more than one violation of paragraph (3), paragraph (4), or paragraph (5) of subsection (a) of Section 11-501 of this Code shall not be eligible to apply for a restricted driving permit under this subparagraph (F).
        A restricted driving permit issued under this
    	
subparagraph (F) shall provide that the holder may only operate motor vehicles equipped with an ignition interlock device as required under paragraph (2) of subsection (c) of Section 6-205 of this Code and subparagraph (A) of paragraph 3 of subsection (c) of this Section. The Secretary may revoke a restricted driving permit or amend the conditions of a restricted driving permit issued under this subparagraph (F) if the holder operates a vehicle that is not equipped with an ignition interlock device, or for any other reason authorized under this Code.
        A restricted driving permit issued under this
    	
subparagraph (F) shall be revoked, and the holder barred from applying for or being issued a restricted driving permit in the future, if the holder is convicted of a violation of Section 11-501 of this Code, a similar provision of a local ordinance, or a similar offense in another state.
    (c-3) In the case of a suspension under paragraph 43 of subsection (a), reports received by the Secretary of State under this Section shall, except during the actual time the suspension is in effect, be privileged information and for use only by the courts, police officers, prosecuting authorities, the driver licensing administrator of any other state, the Secretary of State, or the parent or legal guardian of a driver under the age of 18. However, beginning January 1, 2008, if the person is a CDL holder, the suspension shall also be made available to the driver licensing administrator of any other state, the U.S. Department of Transportation, and the affected driver or motor carrier or prospective motor carrier upon request.
    (c-4) In the case of a suspension under paragraph 43 of subsection (a), the Secretary of State shall notify the person by mail that his or her driving privileges and driver's license will be suspended one month after the date of the mailing of the notice.
    (c-5) The Secretary of State may, as a condition of the reissuance of a driver's license or permit to an applicant whose driver's license or permit has been suspended before he or she reached the age of 21 years pursuant to any of the provisions of this Section, require the applicant to participate in a driver remedial education course and be retested under Section 6-109 of this Code.
    (d) This Section is subject to the provisions of the Drivers License Compact.
    (e) The Secretary of State shall not issue a restricted driving permit to a person under the age of 16 years whose driving privileges have been suspended or revoked under any provisions of this Code.
    (f) In accordance with 49 C.F.R. 384, the Secretary of State may not issue a restricted driving permit for the operation of a commercial motor vehicle to a person holding a CDL whose driving privileges have been suspended, revoked, cancelled, or disqualified under any provisions of this Code.

11-1002 or 11-1002.5 that resulted in a Type A injury to another, in which case the person's driving privileges shall be suspended for 12 months.
    For purposes of paragraphs 5, 9, 10, 12, 14, 19, 25, 26, and 27 of this subsection, license means any driver's license, any traffic ticket issued when the person's driver's license is deposited in lieu of bail, a suspension notice issued by the Secretary of State, a duplicate or corrected driver's license, a probationary driver's license, or a temporary driver's license.
    (b) If any conviction forming the basis of a suspension or revocation authorized under this Section is appealed, the Secretary of State may rescind or withhold the entry of the order of suspension or revocation, as the case may be, provided that a certified copy of a stay order of a court is filed with the Secretary of State. If the conviction is affirmed on appeal, the date of the conviction shall relate back to the time the original judgment of conviction was entered and the 6-month limitation prescribed shall not apply.
    (c) 1. Upon suspending or revoking the driver's license or permit of any person as authorized in this Section, the Secretary of State shall immediately notify the person in writing of the revocation or suspension. The notice to be deposited in the United States mail, postage prepaid, to the last known address of the person.
    2. If the Secretary of State suspends the driver's license of a person under subsection 2 of paragraph (a) of this Section, a person's privilege to operate a vehicle as an occupation shall not be suspended, provided an affidavit is properly completed, the appropriate fee received, and a permit issued prior to the effective date of the suspension, unless 5 offenses were committed, at least 2 of which occurred while operating a commercial vehicle in connection with the driver's regular occupation. All other driving privileges shall be suspended by the Secretary of State. Any driver prior to operating a vehicle for occupational purposes only must submit the affidavit on forms to be provided by the Secretary of State setting forth the facts of the person's occupation. The affidavit shall also state the number of offenses committed while operating a vehicle in connection with the driver's regular occupation. The affidavit shall be accompanied by the driver's license. Upon receipt of a properly completed affidavit, the Secretary of State shall issue the driver a permit to operate a vehicle in connection with the driver's regular occupation only. Unless the permit is issued by the Secretary of State prior to the date of suspension, the privilege to drive any motor vehicle shall be suspended as set forth in the notice that was mailed under this Section. If an affidavit is received subsequent to the effective date of this suspension, a permit may be issued for the remainder of the suspension period.
    The provisions of this subparagraph shall not apply to any driver required to possess a CDL for the purpose of operating a commercial motor vehicle.
    Any person who falsely states any fact in the affidavit required herein shall be guilty of perjury under Section 6-302 and upon conviction thereof shall have all driving privileges revoked without further rights.
    3. At the conclusion of a hearing under Section 2-118 of this Code, the Secretary of State shall either rescind or continue an order of revocation or shall substitute an order of suspension; or, good cause appearing therefor, rescind, continue, change, or extend the order of suspension. If the Secretary of State does not rescind the order, the Secretary may upon application, to relieve undue hardship (as defined by the rules of the Secretary of State), issue a restricted driving permit granting the privilege of driving a motor vehicle between the petitioner's residence and petitioner's place of employment or within the scope of the petitioner's employment-related duties, or to allow the petitioner to transport himself or herself, or a family member of the petitioner's household to a medical facility, to receive necessary medical care, to allow the petitioner to transport himself or herself to and from alcohol or drug remedial or rehabilitative activity recommended by a licensed service provider, or to allow the petitioner to transport himself or herself or a family member of the petitioner's household to classes, as a student, at an accredited educational institution, or to allow the petitioner to transport children, elderly persons, or persons with disabilities who do not hold driving privileges and are living in the petitioner's household to and from daycare. The petitioner must demonstrate that no alternative means of transportation is reasonably available and that the petitioner will not endanger the public safety or welfare.
        (A) If a person's license or permit is revoked or
    	
suspended due to 2 or more convictions of violating Section 11-501 of this Code or a similar provision of a local ordinance or a similar out-of-state offense, or Section 9-3 of the Criminal Code of 1961 or the Criminal Code of 2012, where the use of alcohol or other drugs is recited as an element of the offense, or a similar out-of-state offense, or a combination of these offenses, arising out of separate occurrences, that person, if issued a restricted driving permit, may not operate a vehicle unless it has been equipped with an ignition interlock device as defined in Section 1-129.1.
        (B) If a person's license or permit is revoked or
    	
suspended 2 or more times due to any combination of:
            (i) a single conviction of violating Section
        	
11-501 of this Code or a similar provision of a local ordinance or a similar out-of-state offense or Section 9-3 of the Criminal Code of 1961 or the Criminal Code of 2012, where the use of alcohol or other drugs is recited as an element of the offense, or a similar out-of-state offense; or
            (ii) a statutory summary suspension or revocation
        	
under Section 11-501.1; or
            (iii) a suspension under Section 6-203.1;
    arising out of separate occurrences; that person, if
    	
issued a restricted driving permit, may not operate a vehicle unless it has been equipped with an ignition interlock device as defined in Section 1-129.1.
        (B-5) If a person's license or permit is revoked
    	
or suspended due to a conviction for a violation of subparagraph (C) or (F) of paragraph (1) of subsection (d) of Section 11-501 of this Code, or a similar provision of a local ordinance or similar out-of-state offense, that person, if issued a restricted driving permit, may not operate a vehicle unless it has been equipped with an ignition interlock device as defined in Section 1-129.1.
        (C) The person issued a permit conditioned upon the
    	
use of an ignition interlock device must pay to the Secretary of State DUI Administration Fund an amount not to exceed $30 per month. The Secretary shall establish by rule the amount and the procedures, terms, and conditions relating to these fees.
        (D) If the restricted driving permit is issued for
    	
employment purposes, then the prohibition against operating a motor vehicle that is not equipped with an ignition interlock device does not apply to the operation of an occupational vehicle owned or leased by that person's employer when used solely for employment purposes. For any person who, within a 5-year period, is convicted of a second or subsequent offense under Section 11-501 of this Code, or a similar provision of a local ordinance or similar out-of-state offense, this employment exemption does not apply until either a one-year period has elapsed during which that person had his or her driving privileges revoked or a one-year period has elapsed during which that person had a restricted driving permit which required the use of an ignition interlock device on every motor vehicle owned or operated by that person.
        (E) In each case the Secretary may issue a
    	
restricted driving permit for a period deemed appropriate, except that all permits shall expire no later than 2 years from the date of issuance. A restricted driving permit issued under this Section shall be subject to cancellation, revocation, and suspension by the Secretary of State in like manner and for like cause as a driver's license issued under this Code may be cancelled, revoked, or suspended; except that a conviction upon one or more offenses against laws or ordinances regulating the movement of traffic shall be deemed sufficient cause for the revocation, suspension, or cancellation of a restricted driving permit. The Secretary of State may, as a condition to the issuance of a restricted driving permit, require the applicant to participate in a designated driver remedial or rehabilitative program. The Secretary of State is authorized to cancel a restricted driving permit if the permit holder does not successfully complete the program.
        (F) A person subject to the provisions of paragraph 4
    	
of subsection (b) of Section 6-208 of this Code may make application for a restricted driving permit at a hearing conducted under Section 2-118 of this Code after the expiration of 5 years from the effective date of the most recent revocation or after 5 years from the date of release from a period of imprisonment resulting from a conviction of the most recent offense, whichever is later, provided the person, in addition to all other requirements of the Secretary, shows by clear and convincing evidence:
            (i) a minimum of 3 years of uninterrupted
        	
abstinence from alcohol and the unlawful use or consumption of cannabis under the Cannabis Control Act, a controlled substance under the Illinois Controlled Substances Act, an intoxicating compound under the Use of Intoxicating Compounds Act, or methamphetamine under the Methamphetamine Control and Community Protection Act; and
            (ii) the successful completion of any
        	
rehabilitative treatment and involvement in any ongoing rehabilitative activity that may be recommended by a properly licensed service provider according to an assessment of the person's alcohol or drug use under Section 11-501.01 of this Code.
        In determining whether an applicant is eligible for a
    	
restricted driving permit under this subparagraph (F), the Secretary may consider any relevant evidence, including, but not limited to, testimony, affidavits, records, and the results of regular alcohol or drug tests. Persons subject to the provisions of paragraph 4 of subsection (b) of Section 6-208 of this Code and who have been convicted of more than one violation of paragraph (3), paragraph (4), or paragraph (5) of subsection (a) of Section 11-501 of this Code shall not be eligible to apply for a restricted driving permit under this subparagraph (F).
        A restricted driving permit issued under this
    	
subparagraph (F) shall provide that the holder may only operate motor vehicles equipped with an ignition interlock device as required under paragraph (2) of subsection (c) of Section 6-205 of this Code and subparagraph (A) of paragraph 3 of subsection (c) of this Section. The Secretary may revoke a restricted driving permit or amend the conditions of a restricted driving permit issued under this subparagraph (F) if the holder operates a vehicle that is not equipped with an ignition interlock device, or for any other reason authorized under this Code.
        A restricted driving permit issued under this
    	
subparagraph (F) shall be revoked, and the holder barred from applying for or being issued a restricted driving permit in the future, if the holder is convicted of a violation of Section 11-501 of this Code, a similar provision of a local ordinance, or a similar offense in another state.
    (c-3) In the case of a suspension under paragraph 43 of subsection (a), reports received by the Secretary of State under this Section shall, except during the actual time the suspension is in effect, be privileged information and for use only by the courts, police officers, prosecuting authorities, the driver licensing administrator of any other state, the Secretary of State, or the parent or legal guardian of a driver under the age of 18. However, beginning January 1, 2008, if the person is a CDL holder, the suspension shall also be made available to the driver licensing administrator of any other state, the U.S. Department of Transportation, and the affected driver or motor carrier or prospective motor carrier upon request.
    (c-4) In the case of a suspension under paragraph 43 of subsection (a), the Secretary of State shall notify the person by mail that his or her driving privileges and driver's license will be suspended one month after the date of the mailing of the notice.
    (c-5) The Secretary of State may, as a condition of the reissuance of a driver's license or permit to an applicant whose driver's license or permit has been suspended before he or she reached the age of 21 years pursuant to any of the provisions of this Section, require the applicant to participate in a driver remedial education course and be retested under Section 6-109 of this Code.
    (d) This Section is subject to the provisions of the Driver License Compact.
    (e) The Secretary of State shall not issue a restricted driving permit to a person under the age of 16 years whose driving privileges have been suspended or revoked under any provisions of this Code.
    (f) In accordance with 49 C.F.R. 384, the Secretary of State may not issue a restricted driving permit for the operation of a commercial motor vehicle to a person holding a CDL whose driving privileges have been suspended, revoked, cancelled, or disqualified under any provisions of this Code.

    (625 ILCS 5/6-206.1) (from Ch. 95 1/2, par. 6-206.1)
    Sec. 6-206.1. Monitoring Device Driving Permit. Declaration of Policy. It is hereby declared a policy of the State of Illinois that the driver who is impaired by alcohol, other drug or drugs, or intoxicating compound or compounds is a threat to the public safety and welfare. Therefore, to provide a deterrent to such practice, a statutory summary driver's license suspension is appropriate. It is also recognized that driving is a privilege and therefore, that the granting of driving privileges, in a manner consistent with public safety, is warranted during the period of suspension in the form of a monitoring device driving permit. A person who drives and fails to comply with the requirements of the monitoring device driving permit commits a violation of Section 6-303 of this Code.
    The following procedures shall apply whenever a first offender, as defined in Section 11-500 of this Code, is arrested for any offense as defined in Section 11-501 or a similar provision of a local ordinance and is subject to the provisions of Section 11-501.1:
    (a) Upon mailing of the notice of suspension of driving privileges as provided in subsection (h) of Section 11-501.1 of this Code, the Secretary shall also send written notice informing the person that he or she will be issued a monitoring device driving permit (MDDP). The notice shall include, at minimum, information summarizing the procedure to be followed for issuance of the MDDP, installation of the breath alcohol ignition installation device (BAIID), as provided in this Section, exemption from BAIID installation requirements, and procedures to be followed by those seeking indigent status, as provided in this Section. The notice shall also include information summarizing the procedure to be followed if the person wishes to decline issuance of the MDDP. A copy of the notice shall also be sent to the court of venue together with the notice of suspension of driving privileges, as provided in subsection (h) of Section 11-501. However, a MDDP shall not be issued if the Secretary finds that:
        (1) the offender's driver's license is otherwise
    	
invalid;
        (2) death or great bodily harm to another resulted
    	
from the arrest for Section 11-501;
        (3) the offender has been previously convicted of
    	
reckless homicide or aggravated driving under the influence involving death; or
        (4) the offender is less than 18 years of age.
    Any offender participating in the MDDP program must pay the Secretary a MDDP Administration Fee in an amount not to exceed $30 per month, to be deposited into the Monitoring Device Driving Permit Administration Fee Fund. The Secretary shall establish by rule the amount and the procedures, terms, and conditions relating to these fees. The offender must have an ignition interlock device installed within 14 days of the date the Secretary issues the MDDP. The ignition interlock device provider must notify the Secretary, in a manner and form prescribed by the Secretary, of the installation. If the Secretary does not receive notice of installation, the Secretary shall cancel the MDDP.
    Upon receipt of the notice, as provided in paragraph (a) of this Section, the person may file a petition to decline issuance of the MDDP with the court of venue. The court shall admonish the offender of all consequences of declining issuance of the MDDP including, but not limited to, the enhanced penalties for driving while suspended. After being so admonished, the offender shall be permitted, in writing, to execute a notice declining issuance of the MDDP. This notice shall be filed with the court and forwarded by the clerk of the court to the Secretary. The offender may, at any time thereafter, apply to the Secretary for issuance of a MDDP.
    (a-1) A person issued a MDDP may drive for any purpose and at any time, subject to the rules adopted by the Secretary under subsection (g). The person must, at his or her own expense, drive only vehicles equipped with an ignition interlock device as defined in Section 1-129.1, but in no event shall such person drive a commercial motor vehicle.
    (a-2) Persons who are issued a MDDP and must drive employer-owned vehicles in the course of their employment duties may seek permission to drive an employer-owned vehicle that does not have an ignition interlock device. The employer shall provide to the Secretary a form, as prescribed by the Secretary, completed by the employer verifying that the employee must drive an employer-owned vehicle in the course of employment. If approved by the Secretary, the form must be in the driver's possession while operating an employer-owner vehicle not equipped with an ignition interlock device. No person may use this exemption to drive a school bus, school vehicle, or a vehicle designed to transport more than 15 passengers. No person may use this exemption to drive an employer-owned motor vehicle that is owned by an entity that is wholly or partially owned by the person holding the MDDP, or by a family member of the person holding the MDDP. No person may use this exemption to drive an employer-owned vehicle that is made available to the employee for personal use. No person may drive the exempted vehicle more than 12 hours per day, 6 days per week.
    (a-3) Persons who are issued a MDDP and who must drive a farm tractor to and from a farm, within 50 air miles from the originating farm are exempt from installation of a BAIID on the farm tractor, so long as the farm tractor is being used for the exclusive purpose of conducting farm operations.
    (b) (Blank).
    (c) (Blank).
    (c-1) If the holder of the MDDP is convicted of or receives court supervision for a violation of Section 6-206.2, 6-303, 11-204, 11-204.1, 11-401, 11-501, 11-503, 11-506 or a similar provision of a local ordinance or a similar out-of-state offense or is convicted of or receives court supervision for any offense for which alcohol or drugs is an element of the offense and in which a motor vehicle was involved (for an arrest other than the one for which the MDDP is issued), or de-installs the BAIID without prior authorization from the Secretary, the MDDP shall be cancelled.
    (c-5) If the Secretary determines that the person seeking the MDDP is indigent, the Secretary shall provide the person with a written document as evidence of that determination, and the person shall provide that written document to an ignition interlock device provider. The provider shall install an ignition interlock device on that person's vehicle without charge to the person, and seek reimbursement from the Indigent BAIID Fund. If the Secretary has deemed an offender indigent, the BAIID provider shall also provide the normal monthly monitoring services and the de-installation without charge to the offender and seek reimbursement from the Indigent BAIID Fund. Any other monetary charges, such as a lockout fee or reset fee, shall be the responsibility of the MDDP holder. A BAIID provider may not seek a security deposit from the Indigent BAIID Fund.
    (d) MDDP information shall be available only to the courts, police officers, and the Secretary, except during the actual period the MDDP is valid, during which time it shall be a public record.
    (e) (Blank).
    (f) (Blank).
    (g) The Secretary shall adopt rules for implementing this Section. The rules adopted shall address issues including, but not limited to: compliance with the requirements of the MDDP; methods for determining compliance with those requirements; the consequences of noncompliance with those requirements; what constitutes a violation of the MDDP; methods for determining indigency; and the duties of a person or entity that supplies the ignition interlock device.
    (h) The rules adopted under subsection (g) shall provide, at a minimum, that the person is not in compliance with the requirements of the MDDP if he or she:
        (1) tampers or attempts to tamper with or circumvent
    	
the proper operation of the ignition interlock device;
        (2) provides valid breath samples that register blood
    	
alcohol levels in excess of the number of times allowed under the rules;
        (3) fails to provide evidence sufficient to satisfy
    	
the Secretary that the ignition interlock device has been installed in the designated vehicle or vehicles; or
        (4) fails to follow any other applicable rules
    	
adopted by the Secretary.
    (i) Any person or entity that supplies an ignition interlock device as provided under this Section shall, in addition to supplying only those devices which fully comply with all the rules adopted under subsection (g), provide the Secretary, within 7 days of inspection, all monitoring reports of each person who has had an ignition interlock device installed. These reports shall be furnished in a manner or form as prescribed by the Secretary.
    (j) Upon making a determination that a violation of the requirements of the MDDP has occurred, the Secretary shall extend the summary suspension period for an additional 3 months beyond the originally imposed summary suspension period, during which time the person shall only be allowed to drive vehicles equipped with an ignition interlock device; provided further there are no limitations on the total number of times the summary suspension may be extended. The Secretary may, however, limit the number of extensions imposed for violations occurring during any one monitoring period, as set forth by rule. Any person whose summary suspension is extended pursuant to this Section shall have the right to contest the extension through a hearing with the Secretary, pursuant to Section 2-118 of this Code. If the summary suspension has already terminated prior to the Secretary receiving the monitoring report that shows a violation, the Secretary shall be authorized to suspend the person's driving privileges for 3 months, provided that the Secretary may, by rule, limit the number of suspensions to be entered pursuant to this paragraph for violations occurring during any one monitoring period. Any person whose license is suspended pursuant to this paragraph, after the summary suspension had already terminated, shall have the right to contest the suspension through a hearing with the Secretary, pursuant to Section 2-118 of this Code. The only permit the person shall be eligible for during this new suspension period is a MDDP.
    (k) A person who has had his or her summary suspension extended for the third time, or has any combination of 3 extensions and new suspensions, entered as a result of a violation that occurred while holding the MDDP, so long as the extensions and new suspensions relate to the same summary suspension, shall have his or her vehicle impounded for a period of 30 days, at the person's own expense. A person who has his or her summary suspension extended for the fourth time, or has any combination of 4 extensions and new suspensions, entered as a result of a violation that occurred while holding the MDDP, so long as the extensions and new suspensions relate to the same summary suspension, shall have his or her vehicle subject to seizure and forfeiture. The Secretary shall notify the prosecuting authority of any third or fourth extensions or new suspension entered as a result of a violation that occurred while the person held a MDDP. Upon receipt of the notification, the prosecuting authority shall impound or forfeit the vehicle. The impoundment or forfeiture of a vehicle shall be conducted pursuant to the procedure specified in Article 36 of the Criminal Code of 2012.
    (l) A person whose driving privileges have been suspended under Section 11-501.1 of this Code and who had a MDDP that was cancelled, or would have been cancelled had notification of a violation been received prior to expiration of the MDDP, pursuant to subsection (c-1) of this Section, shall not be eligible for reinstatement when the summary suspension is scheduled to terminate. Instead, the person's driving privileges shall be suspended for a period of not less than twice the original summary suspension period, or for the length of any extensions entered under subsection (j), whichever is longer. During the period of suspension, the person shall be eligible only to apply for a restricted driving permit. If a restricted driving permit is granted, the offender may only operate vehicles equipped with a BAIID in accordance with this Section.
    (m) Any person or entity that supplies an ignition interlock device under this Section shall, for each ignition interlock device installed, pay 5% of the total gross revenue received for the device, including monthly monitoring fees, into the Indigent BAIID Fund. This 5% shall be clearly indicated as a separate surcharge on each invoice that is issued. The Secretary shall conduct an annual review of the fund to determine whether the surcharge is sufficient to provide for indigent users. The Secretary may increase or decrease this surcharge requirement as needed.
    (n) Any person or entity that supplies an ignition interlock device under this Section that is requested to provide an ignition interlock device to a person who presents written documentation of indigency from the Secretary, as provided in subsection (c-5) of this Section, shall install the device on the person's vehicle without charge to the person and shall seek reimbursement from the Indigent BAIID Fund.
    (o) The Indigent BAIID Fund is created as a special fund in the State treasury. The Secretary shall, subject to appropriation by the General Assembly, use all money in the Indigent BAIID Fund to reimburse ignition interlock device providers who have installed devices in vehicles of indigent persons. The Secretary shall make payments to such providers every 3 months. If the amount of money in the fund at the time payments are made is not sufficient to pay all requests for reimbursement submitted during that 3 month period, the Secretary shall make payments on a pro-rata basis, and those payments shall be considered payment in full for the requests submitted.
    (p) The Monitoring Device Driving Permit Administration Fee Fund is created as a special fund in the State treasury. The Secretary shall, subject to appropriation by the General Assembly, use the money paid into this fund to offset its administrative costs for administering MDDPs.
    (q) The Secretary is authorized to prescribe such forms as it deems necessary to carry out the provisions of this Section.

    Sec. 6-207. Secretary of State may require reexamination or reissuance of a license.
    (a) The Secretary of State, having good cause to believe that a licensed driver or person holding a permit or applying for a license or license renewal is incompetent or otherwise not qualified to hold a license or permit, may upon written notice of at least 5 days to the person require the person to submit to an examination as prescribed by the Secretary.
    Refusal or neglect of the person to submit an alcohol, drug, or intoxicating compound evaluation or submit to or failure to successfully complete the examination is grounds for suspension of the person's license or permit under Section 6-206 of this Act or cancellation of his license or permit under Section 6-201 of this Act.
    (b) The Secretary of State, having issued a driver's license or permit in error, may upon written notice of at least 5 days to the person, require the person to appear at a Driver Services facility to have the license or permit error corrected and a new license or permit issued.

restricted driving permit by the Secretary of State; and
            (B) the expiration of a continuous period of

provision of a local ordinance;
            (B) Paragraph (b) of Section 11-401 of this Code
        	
or a similar provision of a local ordinance;
            (C) Section 9-3 of the Criminal Code of 1961 or
        	
the Criminal Code of 2012, relating to the offense of reckless homicide; or

committed at different instances;
    then such person may not make application for a license

        4.5. A bona fide resident of a foreign jurisdiction
    	
who is subject to the provisions of subparagraph 4 of this subsection (b) may make application for termination of the revocation after a period of 10 years from the effective date of the most recent revocation. However, if a person who has been granted a termination of revocation under this subparagraph 4.5 subsequently becomes a resident of this State, the revocation shall be reinstated and the person shall be subject to the provisions of subparagraph 4.
        5. The person may not make application for a license
    	
or permit if the person is convicted of a third or subsequent violation of Section 6-303 of this Code committed while his or her driver's license, permit, or privilege was revoked because of a violation of Section 9-3 of the Criminal Code of 1961 or the Criminal Code of 2012, relating to the offense of reckless homicide, or a similar provision of a law of another state.
    Notwithstanding any other provision of this Code, all persons referred to in this paragraph (b) may not have their privileges restored until the Secretary receives payment of the required reinstatement fee pursuant to subsection (b) of Section 6-118.
    In no event shall the Secretary issue such license unless and until such person has had a hearing pursuant to this Code and the appropriate administrative rules and the Secretary is satisfied, after a review or investigation of such person, that to grant the privilege of driving a motor vehicle on the highways will not endanger the public safety or welfare.

    Sec. 6-305. Renting motor vehicle to another.
    (a) No person shall rent a motor vehicle to any other person unless the latter person, or a driver designated by a nondriver with disabilities and meeting any minimum age and driver's record requirements that are uniformly applied by the person renting a motor vehicle, is then duly licensed hereunder or, in the case of a nonresident, then duly licensed under the laws of the State or country of his residence unless the State or country of his residence does not require that a driver be licensed.
    (b) No person shall rent a motor vehicle to another until he has inspected, including through electronic or digital means, the driver's license of the person to whom the vehicle is to be rented, or by whom it is to be driven, and verified the license is unexpired unless, in the case of a nonresident, the State or country wherein the nonresident resides does not require that a driver be licensed.
    (c) No person shall rent a motorcycle to another unless the latter person is then duly licensed hereunder as a motorcycle operator, and in the case of a nonresident, then duly licensed under the laws of the State or country of his residence, unless the State or country of his residence does not require that a driver be licensed.
    (c-1) A rental car company that rents a motor vehicle shall ensure that the renter is provided with an emergency telephone number to personnel capable of fielding roadside assistance and other customer service inquiries, including the ability to provide the caller with the telephone number of the location from which the vehicle was rented, if requested by the caller. If an owner's manual is not available in the vehicle at the time of the rental, an owner's manual for that vehicle or a similar model shall be accessible by the personnel answering the emergency telephone number for assistance with inquiries about the operation of the vehicle.
    (d) (Blank).
    (e) (Blank).
    (f) Subject to subsection (l), any person who rents a motor vehicle to another shall only advertise, quote, and charge a rental rate that includes the entire amount except taxes, a mileage charge, and airport concession charge, if any, which a renter must pay to hire or lease the vehicle for the period of time to which the rental rate applies. The person must provide, on the request of the renter, based on the available information, an estimated total of the daily rental rate, including all applicable taxes, fees, and other charges, or an estimated total rental charge, based on the return date of the vehicle noted on the rental agreement. Further, if the rental agreement does not already provide an estimated total rental charge, the following statement must be included in the rental agreement:
    "NOTICE: UNDER ILLINOIS LAW, YOU MAY REQUEST, BASED ON
    	
AVAILABLE INFORMATION, AN ESTIMATED TOTAL DAILY RENTAL RATE, INCLUDING TAXES, FEES, AND OTHER CHARGES, OR AN ESTIMATED TOTAL RENTAL CHARGE, BASED ON THE VEHICLE RETURN DATE NOTED ON THIS AGREEMENT."
    Such person shall not charge in addition to the rental rate, taxes, mileage charge, and airport concession charge, if any, any fee which must be paid by the renter as a condition of hiring or leasing the vehicle, such as, but not limited to, required fuel or airport surcharges, nor any fee for transporting the renter to the location where the rented vehicle will be delivered to the renter. In addition to the rental rate, taxes, mileage charge, and airport concession charge, if any, such person may charge for an item or service provided in connection with a particular rental transaction if the renter can avoid incurring the charge by choosing not to obtain or utilize the optional item or service. Items and services for which such person may impose an additional charge include, but are not limited to, optional insurance and accessories requested by the renter, service charges incident to the renter's optional return of the vehicle to a location other than the location where the vehicle was hired or leased, and charges for refueling the vehicle at the conclusion of the rental transaction in the event the renter did not return the vehicle with as much fuel as was in the fuel tank at the beginning of the rental. "Airport concession charge" means a charge or fee imposed and collected from a renter to reimburse the motor vehicle rental company for the concession fee it is required to pay to a local government corporate authority or airport authority to rent motor vehicles at the airport facility. The airport concession charge is in addition to any customer facility charge or any other charge.
    (f-5) A rental car company that offers a renter the opportunity to use a transponder or other electronic tolling device shall notify the renter of the opportunity to use the device at or before the beginning of the rental agreement.
    If a vehicle offered by a rental car company is equipped with a transponder or other electronic tolling device and the company fails to notify the renter of the option to use the device, the rental car company shall not:
        (1) charge a renter a fee of more than $2 each day
    	
for the use of a transponder or other electronic tolling device; however, the company may recoup the actual cost incurred for any toll; and
        (2) charge a renter a daily fee on any day the renter
    	
does not drive through an electronic toll or only drives through an electronic toll collection system for which no alternative payment option exists.
    (g) Every person renting a motor vehicle to another shall keep a record of the registration number of the motor vehicle so rented, the name and address of the person to whom the vehicle is rented, the number of the license, if any, of said latter person, and the place where the license, if any, was issued. Such record may be maintained in an electronic or digital format, and shall be open to inspection by any police officer or designated agent of the Secretary of State.
    (h) A person licensed as a new car dealer under Section 5-101 of this Code shall not be subject to the provisions of this Section regarding the rental of private passenger motor vehicles when providing, free of charge, temporary substitute vehicles for customers to operate during a period when a customer's vehicle, which is either leased or owned by that customer, is being repaired, serviced, replaced or otherwise made unavailable to the customer in accordance with an agreement with the licensed new car dealer or vehicle manufacturer, so long as the customer orally or in writing is made aware that the temporary substitute vehicle will be covered by his or her insurance policy and the customer shall only be liable to the extent of any amount deductible from such insurance coverage in accordance with the terms of the policy.
    (i) This Section, except the requirements of subsection (g), also applies to rental agreements of 30 continuous days or less involving a motor vehicle that was delivered by an out of State person or business to a renter in this State.
    (j) A public airport may, if approved by its local government corporate authorities or its airport authority, impose a customer facility charge upon customers of rental car companies for the purposes of financing, designing, constructing, operating, and maintaining consolidated car rental facilities and common use transportation equipment and facilities, which are used to transport the customer, connecting consolidated car rental facilities with other airport facilities.
    Notwithstanding subsection (f) of this Section, the customer facility charge shall be collected by the rental car company as a separate charge, and clearly indicated as a separate charge on the rental agreement and invoice. Facility charges shall be immediately deposited into a trust account for the benefit of the airport and remitted at the direction of the airport, but not more often than once per month. The charge shall be uniformly calculated on a per-contract or per-day basis. Facility charges imposed by the airport may not exceed the reasonable costs of financing, designing, constructing, operating, and maintaining the consolidated car rental facilities and common use transportation equipment and facilities and may not be used for any other purpose.
    Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the charges collected under this Section are not subject to retailer occupation, sales, use, or transaction taxes.
    (k) When a rental car company states a rental rate in any of its rate advertisements, its proprietary computer reservation systems, or its in-person quotations intended to apply to an airport rental, a company that collects from its customers a customer facility charge for that rental under subsection (j) shall do all of the following:
        (1) Clearly and conspicuously disclose in any radio,
    	
television, or other electronic media advertisements the existence and amount of the charge if the advertisement is intended for rentals at an airport imposing the charge or, if the advertisement covers an area with multiple airports with different charges, a range of amounts of customer facility charges if the advertisement is intended for rentals at an airport imposing the charge.
        (2) Clearly and conspicuously disclose in any print
    	
rate advertising the existence and amount of the charge if the advertisement is intended for rentals at an airport imposing the charge or, if the print rate advertisement covers an area with multiple airports with different charges, a range of amounts of customer facility charges if the advertisement is intended for rentals at an airport imposing the charge.
        (3) Clearly and conspicuously disclose the existence
    	
and amount of the charge in any telephonic, in-person, or computer-transmitted quotation from the rental car company's proprietary computer reservation system at the time of making an initial quotation of a rental rate if the quotation is made by a rental car company location at an airport imposing the charge and at the time of making a reservation of a rental car if the reservation is made by a rental car company location at an airport imposing the charge.
        (4) Clearly and conspicuously display the charge in
    	
any proprietary computer-assisted reservation or transaction directly between the rental car company and the customer, shown or referenced on the same page on the computer screen viewed by the customer as the displayed rental rate and in a print size not smaller than the print size of the rental rate.
        (5) Clearly and conspicuously disclose and separately
    	
identify the existence and amount of the charge on its rental agreement.
        (6) A rental car company that collects from its
    	
customers a customer facility charge under subsection (j) and engages in a practice which does not comply with subsections (f), (j), and (k) commits an unlawful practice within the meaning of the Consumer Fraud and Deceptive Business Practices Act.
    (l) Notwithstanding subsection (f), any person who rents a motor vehicle to another may, in connection with the rental of a motor vehicle to (i) a business renter or (ii) a business program sponsor under the sponsor's business program, do the following:
        (1) separately quote, by telephone, in person, or by
    	
computer transmission, additional charges for the rental; and
        (2) separately impose additional charges for the
    	
rental.
    (l-5) A person licensed under Section 5-101, 5-101.2, or 5-102 of this Code shall not participate in a rental-purchase agreement vehicle program unless the licensee retains the vehicle in his or her name and retains proof of proper vehicle registration under Chapter 3 of this Code and liability insurance under Section 7-601 of this Code. The licensee shall transfer ownership of the vehicle to the renter within 20 calendar days of the agreed-upon date of completion of the rental-purchase agreement. If the licensee fails to transfer ownership of the vehicle to the renter within the 20 calendar days, then the renter may apply for the vehicle's title to the Secretary of State by providing the Secretary the rental-purchase agreement, an application for title, the required title fee, and any other documentation the Secretary deems necessary to determine ownership of the vehicle. For purposes of this subsection (l-5), "rental-purchase agreement" has the meaning set forth in Section 1 of the Rental-Purchase Agreement Act.
    (m) As used in this Section:
        (1) "Additional charges" means charges other than:
    	
(i) a per period base rental rate; (ii) a mileage charge; (iii) taxes; or (iv) a customer facility charge.
        (2) "Business program" means:

            (B) a plan, program, or other arrangement
        	
established by a person who rents motor vehicles at the request of, or with the consent of, a business program sponsor under which the person offers to rent motor vehicles to persons authorized by the sponsor on terms that are not the same as those generally offered by the rental company to the public.
        (3) "Business program sponsor" means any legal
    	
entity other than a natural person, including a corporation, limited liability company, partnership, government, municipality or agency, or a natural person operating a business as a sole proprietor.

        (1) The lesser of:
            (A) Actual and reasonable costs that the person
        	
who rents a motor vehicle to another incurred to repair the motor vehicle or that the rental company would have incurred if the motor vehicle had been repaired, which shall reflect any discounts, price reductions, or adjustments available to the rental company; or
            (B) The fair market value of that motor vehicle
        	
immediately before the damage occurred, as determined in the customary market for the retail sale of that motor vehicle; and
        (2) Actual and reasonable costs incurred by the loss
    	
due to theft of the rental motor vehicle up to $2,000; provided, however, that if it is established that the renter or an authorized driver failed to exercise ordinary care while in possession of the vehicle or that the renter or an authorized driver committed or aided and abetted the commission of the theft, then the damages shall be the actual and reasonable costs of the rental vehicle up to its fair market value, as determined by the customary market for the sale of that vehicle.
    For purposes of this subsection (b), for the period prior to June 1, 1998, the maximum amount that may be recovered from an authorized driver shall not exceed $6,000; for the period beginning June 1, 1998 through May 31, 1999, the maximum recovery shall not exceed $7,500; and for the period beginning June 1, 1999 through May 31, 2000, the maximum recovery shall not exceed $9,000.

    (b-5) Limits on liability: vehicle MSRP more than $50,000. The total liability of a renter under subsection (a) for damage to a motor vehicle with a Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) of more than $50,000 may not exceed all of the following:
        (1) the lesser of:
            (A) actual and reasonable costs that the person
        	
who rents a motor vehicle to another incurred to repair the motor vehicle or that the rental company would have incurred if the motor vehicle had been repaired, which shall reflect any discounts, price reductions, or adjustments available to the rental company; or
            (B) the fair market value of that motor vehicle
        	
immediately before the damage occurred, as determined in the customary market for the retail sale of that motor vehicle; and
        (2) the actual and reasonable costs incurred by the
    	
loss due to theft of the rental motor vehicle up to $40,000.
    The maximum recovery for a motor vehicle with a Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) of more than $50,000 under this subsection (b-5) shall not exceed $40,000 on the effective date of this amendatory Act of the 99th General Assembly. On October 1, 2016, and for the next 3 years thereafter, the maximum amount that may be recovered from an authorized driver under this subsection (b-5) shall be increased by $2,500 above the prior year's maximum recovery. On October 1, 2020, and for each year thereafter, the maximum amount that may be recovered from an authorized driver under this subsection (b-5) shall be increased by $1,000 above the prior year's maximum recovery.
    (c) Multiple recoveries prohibited. Any person who rents a motor vehicle to another may not hold the renter liable for any amounts that the rental company recovers from any other party.
    (d) Repair estimates. A person who rents a motor vehicle to another may not collect or attempt to collect the amount described in subsection (b) or (b-5) unless the rental company obtains an estimate from a repair company or an appraiser in the business of providing such appraisals on the costs of repairing the motor vehicle, makes a copy of the estimate available upon request to the renter who may be liable under subsection (a), or the insurer of the renter, and submits a copy of the estimate with any claim to collect the amount described in subsection (b) or (b-5). In order to collect the amount described in subsection (b-5), a person renting a motor vehicle to another must also provide the renter's personal insurance company with reasonable notice and an opportunity to inspect damages.
    (d-5) In the event of loss due to theft of the rental motor vehicle with a MSRP more than $50,000, the rental company shall provide reasonable notice of the theft to the renter's personal insurance company.
    (e) Duty to mitigate. A claim against a renter resulting from damage or loss to a rental vehicle must be reasonably and rationally related to the actual loss incurred. A rental company shall mitigate damages where possible and shall not assert or collect any claim for physical damage which exceeds the actual costs of the repair, including all discounts or price reductions.
    (f) No rental company shall require a deposit or an advance charge against the credit card of a renter, in any form, for damages to a vehicle which is in the renter's possession, custody, or control. No rental company shall require any payment for damage to the rental vehicle, upon the renter's return of the vehicle in a damaged condition, until after the cost of the damage to the vehicle and liability therefor is agreed to between the rental company and renter or is determined pursuant to law.
    (g) If insurance coverage exists under the renter's personal insurance policy and the coverage is confirmed during regular business hours, the renter may require that the rental company must submit any claims to the renter's personal insurance carrier as the renter's agent. The rental company shall not make any written or oral representations that it will not present claims or negotiate with the renter's insurance carrier. For purposes of this Section, confirmation of coverage includes telephone confirmation from insurance company representatives during regular business hours. After confirmation of coverage, the amount of claim shall be resolved between the insurance carrier and the rental company.

An ordinance so providing shall specify that the notice sent to the person liable for any fine or penalty shall state that failure to pay the fine or penalty owing within 45 days of the notice's date will result in the municipality or county notifying the Secretary of State that the person's drivers license is eligible for suspension pursuant to this Section.

Part 390.5.

        4. Whether the person did refuse to submit to or
    	
failed to complete the chemical testing or did submit to such test or tests and such test or tests disclosed an alcohol concentration of at least 0.04 or any amount of a drug, substance, or compound resulting from the unlawful use or consumption of cannabis listed in the Cannabis Control Act or a controlled substance listed in the Illinois Controlled Substances Act or methamphetamine as listed in the Methamphetamine Control and Community Protection Act in the person's system;
        5. Whether the person was warned that if the test or
    	
tests disclosed an alcohol concentration of 0.08 or more or any amount of a drug, substance, or compound resulting from the unlawful use or consumption of cannabis listed in the Cannabis Control Act or a controlled substance listed in the Illinois Controlled Substances Act or methamphetamine as listed in the Methamphetamine Control and Community Protection Act, such results could be admissible in a subsequent prosecution under Section 11-501 of this Code or similar provision of local ordinances; and
        6. Whether such results could not be used to impose
    	
any driver's license sanctions pursuant to Section 11-501.1.
    Upon the conclusion of the above CDL hearing, the CDL disqualification imposed shall either be sustained or rescinded.

        3. Whether the person was verbally warned of the
    	
ensuing consequences prior to being asked to submit to any type of chemical test or tests to determine such person's alcohol, other drug, or both, concentration; and
        4. Whether, after being so warned, the person did
    	
refuse to submit to or failed to complete such chemical test or tests or did submit to such test or tests and such test or tests disclosed an alcohol concentration greater than 0.00 or any amount of a drug, substance, or compound resulting from the unlawful use or consumption of cannabis listed in the Cannabis Control Act or a controlled substance listed in the Illinois Controlled Substances Act or methamphetamine as listed in the Methamphetamine Control and Community Protection Act.

    (e) If any person petitions for a hearing relating to any CDL disqualification based upon a conviction, as defined in this UCDLA, said hearing shall not be conducted as a CDL hearing, but shall be conducted as any other driver's license hearing, whether formal or informal, as promulgated in the rules and regulations of the Secretary.
    (f) Any evidence of alcohol or other drug consumption, for the purposes of this UCDLA, shall be sufficient probable cause for requesting the driver to submit to a chemical test or tests to determine the presence of alcohol, other drug, or both in the person's system and the subsequent issuance of an out-of-service order or a Sworn Report by a police officer.

    (625 ILCS 5/6-801) (from Ch. 95 1/2, par. 6-801)
    Sec. 6-801. Findings, Declaration of Policy and Purpose. (a) The party jurisdictions find that:
    1. In most instances, a motorist who is cited for a traffic violation in a jurisdiction other than the motorist's home jurisdiction:
    (i) Must post collateral or bond to secure appearance for trial at a later date; or
    (ii) If unable to post collateral or bond, is taken into custody until the collateral or bond is posted; or
    (iii) Is taken directly to court for immediate disposition.
    2. A motorist receiving a traffic citation in the motorist's home jurisdiction is permitted, except for certain violations, to accept the citation from the officer at the scene of the violation, voluntarily deposit a valid driver's license and immediately continue after promising or being instructed to comply with the terms of the citation.
    3. The purpose of the practices described in subsections 1 and 2 of paragraph (a) is to ensure compliance with the terms of a traffic citation by the motorist who, if permitted to continue after receiving the traffic citation, could return to the motorist's home jurisdiction and disregard any duty under the terms of the traffic citation.
    4. The practice described in subsection 1 of paragraph (a) causes unnecessary inconvenience and, at times, a hardship for the motorist who is unable at the time to post collateral, furnish a bond, stand trial, or pay the fine, and thus is compelled to remain in custody until some arrangement can be made.
    5. The deposit of a driver's license as a bail bond, as described in subsection 2 of paragraph (a), is viewed with disfavor.
    6. The practices described herein consume an undue amount of law enforcement time.
    (b) It is the policy of the party jurisdictions to:
    1. Seek compliance with the laws, ordinances, and administrative rules and regulations relating to the operation of motor vehicles in each of the jurisdictions.
    2. Allow a motorist to accept a traffic citation for certain violations and proceed without delay whether or not the motorist is a resident of the jurisdiction in which the citation was issued.
    3. Extend cooperation to its fullest extent among the jurisdictions for obtaining compliance with the terms of a traffic citation issued in one jurisdiction to a resident of another jurisdiction.
    4. Maximize effective utilization of law enforcement personnel and assist court systems in the efficient disposition of traffic violations.
    (c) The purpose of the Compact is to:
    1. Provide a means through which the party jurisdictions may participate in a reciprocal program to effectuate the policies enumerated in paragraph (b) above in a uniform and orderly manner.
    2. Provide for the fair and impartial treatment of traffic violators operating within party jurisdictions in recognition of the motorist's right of due process and the sovereign status of a party jurisdiction.

    (a) When issuing a citation for a traffic violation, a police officer shall issue the citation to a motorist who possesses a valid driver's license issued by a party jurisdiction and shall not, subject to paragraph (b) of this Section, require the motorist to post collateral to secure appearance, if the officer receives the motorist's personal recognizance to comply with the terms of the citation.

    (f) The Secretary shall not transmit a report on any violation if the date of transmission is more than 6 months after the date on which the traffic citation was issued.
    (g) The Secretary shall not transmit a report on any violation where the date of issuance of the citation predates the most recent of the effective dates of entry for the two jurisdictions affected.

    (b) Owner's Policy. --Such owner's policy of liability insurance:
        1. Shall designate by explicit description or by
    	
appropriate reference, all motor vehicles with respect to which coverage is thereby intended to be granted;
        2. Shall insure the person named therein and any
    	
other person using or responsible for the use of such motor vehicle or vehicles with the express or implied permission of the insured;
        3. Shall insure every named insured and any other

    (d) Required Statements in Policies. --Every motor vehicle liability policy must specify the name and address of the insured, the coverage afforded by the policy, the premium charged therefor, the policy period, and the limits of liability, and shall contain an agreement that the insurance thereunder is provided in accordance with the coverage defined in this Act, as respects bodily injury and death or property damage or both, and is subject to all the provisions of this Act.
    (e) Policy Need Not Insure Workers' Compensation. --Any liability policy or policies issued hereunder need not cover any liability of the insured assumed by or imposed upon the insured under any workers' compensation law nor any liability for damage to property in charge of the insured or the insured's employees.
    (f) Provisions Incorporated in Policy. --Every motor vehicle liability policy is subject to the following provisions which need not be contained therein:
        1. The liability of the insurance carrier under any
    	
such policy shall become absolute whenever loss or damage covered by the policy occurs and the satisfaction by the insured of a final judgment for such loss or damage shall not be a condition precedent to the right or obligation of the carrier to make payment on account of such loss or damage.
        2. No such policy may be cancelled or annulled as
    	
respects any loss or damage, by any agreement between the carrier and the insured after the insured has become responsible for such loss or damage, and any such cancellation or annulment shall be void.
        3. The insurance carrier shall, however, have the
    	
right to settle any claim covered by the policy, and if such settlement is made in good faith, the amount thereof shall be deductible from the limits of liability specified in the policy.
        4. The policy, the written application therefor, if
    	
any, and any rider or endorsement which shall not conflict with the provisions of this Act shall constitute the entire contract between the parties.
    (g) Excess or Additional Coverage. --Any motor vehicle liability policy may, however, grant any lawful coverage in excess of or in addition to the coverage herein specified or contain any agreements, provisions, or stipulations not in conflict with the provisions of this Act and not otherwise contrary to law.
    (h) Reimbursement Provision Permitted. --The policy may provide that the insured, or any other person covered by the policy shall reimburse the insurance carrier for payment made on account of any loss or damage claim or suit involving a breach of the terms, provisions or conditions of the policy; and further, if the policy shall provide for limits in excess of the limits specified in this Act, the insurance carrier may plead against any plaintiff, with respect to the amount of such excess limits of liability, any defense which it may be entitled to plead against the insured.
    (i) Proration of Insurance Permitted. --The policy may provide for the pro-rating of the insurance thereunder with other applicable valid and collectible insurance.
    (j) Binders. --Any binder pending the issuance of any policy, which binder contains or by reference includes the provisions hereunder shall be sufficient proof of ability to respond in damages.
    (k) Copy of Policy to Be Filed with Department of Insurance--Approval. --A copy of the form of every motor vehicle liability policy which is to be used to meet the requirements of this Act must be filed, by the company offering such policy, with the Department of Insurance, which shall approve or disapprove the policy within 30 days of its filing. If the Department approves the policy in writing within such 30 day period or fails to take action for 30 days, the form of policy shall be deemed approved as filed. If within the 30 days the Department disapproves the form of policy filed upon the ground that it does not comply with the requirements of this Act, the Department shall give written notice of its decision and its reasons therefor to the carrier and the policy shall not be accepted as proof of financial responsibility under this Act.
    (l) Insurance Carrier Required to File Certificate. --An insurance carrier who has issued a motor vehicle liability policy or policies or an operator's policy meeting the requirements of this Act shall, upon the request of the insured therein, deliver to the insured for filing, or at the request of the insured, shall file direct, with the Secretary of State a certificate, as required by this Act, which shows that such policy or policies have been issued. No insurance carrier may require the payment of any extra fee or surcharge, in addition to the insurance premium, for the execution, delivery or filing of such certificate.
    (m) Proof When Made By Endorsement. --Any motor vehicle liability policy which by endorsement contains the provisions required hereunder shall be sufficient proof of ability to respond in damages.

The Director shall make equitable distribution of such assignments among insurance carriers proportionate, so far as practicable, by premiums to the respective net direct automobile bodily injury premium writings of the carriers authorized to do business in this State. The Director of Insurance shall establish rules and regulations for the administration of the provisions of this Section.

    (a) No person shall operate, register or maintain registration of, and no owner shall permit another person to operate, register or maintain registration of, a motor vehicle designed to be used on a public highway in this State unless the motor vehicle is covered by a liability insurance policy.
    The insurance policy shall be issued in amounts no less than the minimum amounts set for bodily injury or death and for destruction of property under Section 7-203 of this Code, and shall be issued in accordance with the requirements of Sections 143a and 143a-2 of the Illinois Insurance Code, as amended.

Nothing herein shall deprive an insurer of any policy defense available at common law.
    (b) The following vehicles are exempt from the requirements of this Section:
        (1) vehicles subject to the provisions of Chapters 8
    	
or 18a, Article III or Section 7-609 of Chapter 7, or Sections 12-606 or 12-707.01 of Chapter 12 of this Code;

    (c) Every employee of a State agency, as that term is defined in the Illinois State Auditing Act, who is assigned a specific vehicle owned or leased by the State on an ongoing basis shall provide the certification described in this Section annually to the director or chief executive officer of his or her agency.
    The certification shall affirm that the employee is duly licensed to drive the assigned vehicle and that (i) the employee has liability insurance coverage extending to the employee when the assigned vehicle is used for other than official State business, or (ii) the employee has filed a bond with the Secretary of State as proof of financial responsibility, in an amount equal to, or in excess of the requirements stated within this Section. Upon request of the agency director or chief executive officer, the employee shall present evidence to support the certification.
    The certification shall be provided during the period July 1 through July 31 of each calendar year, or within 30 days of any new assignment of a vehicle on an ongoing basis, whichever is later.
    The employee's authorization to use the assigned vehicle shall automatically be rescinded upon:

    Sec. 7-602. Insurance card. Every operator of a motor vehicle subject to Section 7-601 of this Code shall carry within the vehicle evidence of insurance. The evidence shall be legible and sufficient to demonstrate that the motor vehicle currently is covered by a liability insurance policy as required under Section 7-601 of this Code and may include, but is not limited to, the following:
        (a) an insurance card provided by the insurer under
    	
this Section;
        (b) the combination of proof of purchase of the motor
    	
vehicle within the previous 60 days and a current insurance card issued for the motor vehicle replaced by such purchase;
        (c) the current declarations page of a liability
    	
insurance policy;
        (d) a liability insurance binder, certificate of
    	
liability insurance or receipt for payment to an insurer or its authorized representative for a liability insurance premium, provided such document contains all information the Secretary of State by rule and regulation may require;
        (e) a current rental agreement;
        (f) registration plates or digital registration
    	
plates, registration sticker or digital registration sticker, or other evidence of registration issued by the Secretary only upon submission of proof of liability insurance pursuant to this Code;
        (g) a certificate, decal, or other document or device
    	
issued by a governmental agency for a motor vehicle indicating the vehicle is insured for liability pursuant to law;
        (h) the display of electronic images on a cellular
    	
phone or other type of portable electronic device. The use of a cellular phone or other type of portable electronic device to display proof of insurance does not constitute consent for a law enforcement officer, court, or other officer of the court to access other contents of the electronic device. Any law enforcement officer, court, or officer of the court presented with the device shall be immune from any liability resulting from damage to the mobile electronic device.
    An insurance card shall be provided for each motor vehicle insured by the insurer issuing the liability insurance policy and may be issued in either paper or electronic format. Acceptable electronic formats shall permit display on a cellular phone or other portable electronic device and satisfy all other requirements of law and rule, including this Section, regarding form and content.
    The form, contents and manner of issuance of the insurance card shall be prescribed by rules and regulations of the Secretary of State. The Secretary shall adopt rules requiring that reasonable measures be taken to prevent the fraudulent production of insurance cards. The insurance card shall display an effective date and an expiration date covering a period of time not to exceed 12 months. The insurance card shall contain the following disclaimer: "Examine policy exclusions carefully. This form does not constitute any part of your insurance policy." If the insurance policy represented by the insurance card does not cover any driver operating the motor vehicle with the owner's permission, or the owner when operating a motor vehicle other than the vehicle for which the policy is issued, the insurance card shall contain a warning of such limitations in the coverage provided by the policy.
    No insurer shall issue a card, similar in appearance, form and content to the insurance card required under this Section, in connection with an insurance policy that does not provide the liability insurance coverage required under Section 7-601 of this Code.
    The evidence of insurance shall be displayed upon request made by any law enforcement officer wearing a uniform or displaying a badge or other sign of authority. Any person who fails or refuses to comply with such request is in violation of Section 3-707 of this Code. Any person who displays evidence of insurance, knowing there is no valid liability insurance in effect on the motor vehicle as required under Section 7-601 of this Code or knowing the evidence of insurance is illegally altered, counterfeit or otherwise invalid, is in violation of Section 3-710 of this Code.
    "Display" means the manual surrender of the evidence of insurance into the hands of the law enforcement officer, court, or officer of the court making the request for the officer's, court's, or officer of the court's inspection thereof.

    (a) The Secretary may implement a program of electronic motor vehicle liability insurance policy verification for motor vehicles subject to Section 7-601 of this Code for the purpose of verifying whether or not the motor vehicle is insured. The development and implementation of the program shall be consistent with the standards and procedures of a nationwide organization whose primary membership consists of individual insurance companies and insurance trade associations. The program shall include, but is not limited to:
        (1) a requirement that an insurance company
    	
authorized to sell motor vehicle liability insurance in this State shall make available, in a format designated by the Secretary that is consistent with a nationwide organization whose primary membership consists of individual insurance companies and insurance trade organizations, to the Secretary for each motor vehicle liability insurance policy issued by the company the following information:
            (A) the name of the policy holder;
            (B) the make, model, year, and vehicle
        	
identification number of the covered motor vehicle;
            (C) the policy number;
            (D) the policy effective date;
            (E) the insurance company's National Association
        	
of Insurance Commissioner's number; and
            (F) any other information the Secretary deems
        	
necessary to match an eligible vehicle with an insurance policy;
        (2) a method for searching motor vehicle liability
    	
insurance policies issued and in effect in this State by using the information under paragraph (1) of this subsection (a);
        (3) a requirement that at least twice per calendar
    	
year, the Secretary shall verify the existence of a liability insurance policy for every registered motor vehicle subject to Section 7-601 of this Code; and if the Secretary is unable to verify the existence of a liability insurance policy, the Secretary shall, by U.S. mail or electronic mail, send the vehicle owner a written notice allowing the vehicle owner 30 calendar days to provide proof of insurance on the date of attempted verification, or to provide proof that the vehicle is no longer operable;
        (4) a requirement that a vehicle owner who does not
    	
provide proof of insurance or proof of an inoperable vehicle under paragraph (3) of this subsection (a) shall be in violation of Section 7-601 of this Code and the Secretary shall suspend the vehicle's registration and the owner shall pay any applicable reinstatement fees and shall provide proof of insurance before the Secretary may reinstate the vehicle's registration under Section 7-606 of this Code;
        (5) a requirement that if a vehicle owner provides
    	
proof of insurance on the date of the attempted verification under paragraph (3) of this subsection (1), the Secretary may verify the vehicle owner's response by furnishing necessary information to the insurance company. Within 7 calendar days of receiving the information, the insurance company shall confirm and notify the Secretary the dates of the motor vehicle's insurance coverage. If the insurance company does not confirm coverage for the date of attempted verification, the Secretary shall suspend the vehicle's registration and the owner of the vehicle shall pay any applicable reinstatement fees and shall provide proof of insurance before the Secretary may reinstate the vehicle's registration under Section 7-606 of this Code;
        (6) a requirement that the Secretary may consult with
    	
members of the insurance industry during the implementation of the program, including, but not limited to, during the drafting process for adopting any rules that may be necessary to implement or manage an electronic motor vehicle liability insurance policy verification program;
        (7) a requirement that commercial lines of automobile
    	
insurance are excluded from the program, but may voluntarily report insurance coverage to the State.
    (b) In addition to the semi-annual verification of liability insurance under subsection (a) of this Section, the Secretary may select monthly verification for a motor vehicle owned or registered by a person:
        (1) whose motor vehicle registration during the
    	
preceding 4 years has been suspended under Section 7-606 or 7-607 of this Code;
        (2) who, during the preceding 4 years, has been
    	
convicted of violating Section 3-707, 3-708, or 3-710 of this Code while operating a vehicle owned by another person;
        (3) whose driving privileges have been suspended
    	
during the preceding 4 years;
        (4) who, during the preceding 4 years, acquired
    	
ownership of a motor vehicle while the registration of the vehicle under the previous owner was suspended under Section 7-606 or 7-607 of this Code; or
        (5) who, during the preceding 4 years, has received a
    	
disposition of court supervision under subsection (c) of Section 5-6-1 of the Unified Code of Corrections for a violation of Section 3-707, 3-708, or 3-710 of this Code.
    (c) Nothing in this Section provides the Secretary with regulatory authority over insurance companies.
    (d) The Secretary may contract with a private contractor to carry out the Secretary's duties under this Section.
    (e) Any information collected, stored, maintained, or referred to under this Section shall be used solely for the purpose of verifying whether a registered motor vehicle meets the requirements of Section 7-601 of this Code and shall be exempt from a records request or from inspection and copying under the Freedom of Information Act. A request for release of verification of liability insurance policy information from the Secretary shall require a court order, subpoena, or the motor vehicle owner's approval.
    (f) An insurer identified by an electronic motor vehicle liability insurance policy program as insuring less than 1,000 vehicles per year shall be exempt from the reporting requirements under subsection (a) of this Section.
    (g) The Secretary may adopt any rules necessary to implement this Section.

    Sec. 7-604. Verification of liability insurance policy.
    (a) The Secretary of State may select random samples of registrations of motor vehicles subject to Section 7-601 of this Code, or owners thereof, for the purpose of verifying whether or not the motor vehicles are insured.
    In addition to such general random samples of motor vehicle registrations, the Secretary may select for verification other random samples, including, but not limited to registrations of motor vehicles owned by persons:
        (1) whose motor vehicle registrations during the
    	
preceding 4 years have been suspended pursuant to Section 7-606 or 7-607 of this Code;
        (2) who during the preceding 4 years have been
    	
convicted of violating Section 3-707, 3-708, or 3-710 of this Code while operating vehicles owned by other persons;
        (3) whose driving privileges have been suspended
    	
during the preceding 4 years;
        (4) who during the preceding 4 years acquired
    	
ownership of motor vehicles while the registrations of such vehicles under the previous owners were suspended pursuant to Section 7-606 or 7-607 of this Code; or
        (5) who during the preceding 4 years have received a
    	
disposition of supervision under subsection (c) of Section 5-6-1 of the Unified Code of Corrections for a violation of Section 3-707, 3-708, or 3-710 of this Code.
    (b) Upon receiving certification from the Department of Transportation under Section 7-201.2 of this Code of the name of an owner or operator of any motor vehicle involved in an accident, the Secretary may verify whether or not at the time of the accident such motor vehicle was covered by a liability insurance policy in accordance with Section 7-601 of this Code.
    (c) In preparation for selection of random samples and their verification, the Secretary may send to owners of randomly selected motor vehicles, or to randomly selected motor vehicle owners, requests for information about their motor vehicles and liability insurance coverage electronically or, if electronic means are unavailable, via U.S. mail. The request shall require the owner to state whether or not the motor vehicle was insured on the verification date stated in the Secretary's request and the request may require, but is not limited to, a statement by the owner of the names and addresses of insurers, policy numbers, and expiration dates of insurance coverage.
    (d) Within 30 days after the Secretary sends a request under subsection (c) of this Section, the owner to whom it is sent shall furnish the requested information to the Secretary above the owner's signed affirmation that such information is true and correct. Proof of insurance in effect on the verification date, as prescribed by the Secretary, may be considered by the Secretary to be a satisfactory response to the request for information.
    Any owner whose response indicates that his or her vehicle was not covered by a liability insurance policy in accordance with Section 7-601 of this Code shall be deemed to have registered or maintained registration of a motor vehicle in violation of that Section. Any owner who fails to respond to such a request shall be deemed to have registered or maintained registration of a motor vehicle in violation of Section 7-601 of this Code.
    (e) If the owner responds to the request for information by asserting that his or her vehicle was covered by a liability insurance policy on the verification date stated in the Secretary's request, the Secretary may conduct a verification of the response by furnishing necessary information to the insurer named in the response. The insurer shall within 45 days inform the Secretary whether or not on the verification date stated the motor vehicle was insured by the insurer in accordance with Section 7-601 of this Code. The Secretary may by rule and regulation prescribe the procedures for verification.
    (f) No random sample selected under this Section shall be categorized on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, national origin, ancestry, age, marital status, physical or mental disability, economic status, or geography.
    (g) (Blank).
    (h) This Section shall be inoperative upon the effective date of the rules adopted by the Secretary to implement Section 7-603.5 of this Code.

The Secretary shall suspend the vehicle registration of any motor vehicle determined by the Secretary to be in violation of Section 7-601 of this Code, including any motor vehicle operated in violation of Section 3-707, 3-708 or 3-710 of this Code by an operator other than the owner of the vehicle. Neither the fact that, subsequent to the date of verification or conviction, the owner acquired the required liability insurance policy nor the fact that the owner terminated ownership of the motor vehicle shall have any bearing upon the Secretary's decision to suspend.
    The Secretary is authorized to suspend the registration of any motor vehicle registered in this State upon receiving notice of the conviction of the operator of the motor vehicle in another State of an offense which, if committed in this State, would constitute a violation of Section 7-601 of this Code.

    Sec. 7-609. Exemption for certain religious organizations. (a) Pursuant to the following minimum criteria, the Secretary may exempt from the provisions of Section 7-601 of this Code motor vehicles owned by a religious organization or its members:
    (1) The religious organization and its members hold a bona fide conviction that the acquisition of insurance is contrary to their religious beliefs.
    (2) The religious organization and its members submit to the Secretary evidence that historically, over a period of time not less than two years, they have paid or, by agreement with the other party or parties involved, are paying in a timely manner for all damages for which they were or are liable.
    (3) The religious organization has filed with the Secretary a current, irrevocable letter of credit, valid for a period of 12 months and issued in accordance with this Section and Article 5 of the Uniform Commercial Code, approved July 31, 1961, as amended, by a financial institution chartered by an agency of State or federal government. The Secretary of State by rule and regulation shall establish the minimum amount of credit required.
    (4) The religious organization and its members meet other requirement which the Secretary by rule and regulation may prescribe.
    (b) Upon accepting a letter of credit from a religious organization, the Secretary shall issue a certificate of exemption for each motor vehicle covered. The certificate of exemption shall serve as evidence of insurance in accordance with Section 7-602 of this Code.
    Not less than 30 days before a current letter of credit expires, or by agreement between the issuer and customer is revoked, the religious organization shall file with the Secretary a new letter of credit. If a new letter of credit is not on file with the Secretary at the time the current letter of credit expires or is revoked, the exemption of the religious organization and its members shall expire and their certificates of exemption shall become invalid.
    (c) If credit is used to the extent that the remaining amount of credit does not meet the minimum requirements of this Section, and the issuer declines to reinstate the used portion of the credit or issue a new letter of credit, the issuer immediately shall send written notice to the customer and the Secretary that the current letter of credit on file with the Secretary no longer meets the minimum requirements of the law.
    If, within 30 days of receiving the notice, the Secretary has not received and accepted a new letter of credit from the customer, the exemption of that religious organization and its members shall expire and their certificates of exemption shall become invalid.
    (d) Upon the request of the plaintiff, if a person, known by the court to be covered by a current letter of credit issued pursuant to this Section fails to pay a judgment for damages within 30 days after the judgment has become final, the clerk of the court within 10 days shall forward to the Secretary a report of the person's failure to pay. The report shall indicate that the person is covered by a letter of credit and, if known by the court, the names of the issuer and the customer.
    Upon receiving the report from the court, the Secretary shall notify the religious organization that, unless the payment is made, 30 days after the date of the mailing of the notice the exemption of the religious organization and its members shall be terminated and their certificates of exemption shall become invalid. If within the 30 days the religious organization does not submit evidence that the payment has been made, or furnish valid reasons why the payment has been delayed or not made, the Secretary shall terminate the exemptions.
    (e) The Secretary is authorized to promulgate rules and regulations necessary for the administration of the provisions of this Section.

ARTICLE VII. FAMILY FINANCIAL RESPONSIBILITY LAW

    (625 ILCS 5/7-701)
    Sec. 7-701. Findings and purpose. The General Assembly finds that the timely receipt of adequate financial support has the effect of reducing poverty and State expenditures for welfare dependency among children, and that the timely payment of adequate child support demonstrates financial responsibility. Further, the General Assembly finds that the State has a compelling interest in ensuring that drivers within the State demonstrate financial responsibility, including family financial responsibility, in order to safely own and operate a motor vehicle. Further, the General Assembly finds that the State has a compelling interest in ensuring that those individuals with responsibilities involving minor children pursuant to visitation orders demonstrate responsibility, including family responsibility, in order to safely own and operate a motor vehicle, especially when transporting a minor child who is the subject of a visitation order. To this end, the Secretary of State is authorized to establish systems to suspend driver's licenses for failure to comply with court and administrative orders of support.

    (a) The Secretary of State shall suspend the driver's license issued to an obligor upon receiving an authenticated report provided for in subsection (a) of Section 7-703, that the person is 90 days or more delinquent in court ordered child support payments or has been adjudicated in arrears in an amount equal to 90 days obligation or more, and has been found in contempt by the court for failure to pay the support.
    (b) The Secretary of State shall suspend the driver's license issued to an obligor upon receiving an authenticated document provided for in subsection (b) of Section 7-703, that the person has been adjudicated in arrears in court ordered child support payments in an amount equal to 90 days obligation or more, but has not been held in contempt of court, and that the court has ordered that the person's driving privileges be suspended. The obligor's driver's license shall be suspended until such time as the Secretary of State receives authenticated documentation that the obligor is in compliance with the court order of support. When the obligor complies with the court ordered child support payments, the circuit court shall report the obligor's compliance with the court order of support to the Secretary of State, on a form prescribed by the Secretary of State, and shall order that the obligor's driver's license be reinstated.
    (c) The Secretary of State shall suspend a driver's license upon certification by the Illinois Department of Healthcare and Family Services, in a manner and form prescribed by the Illinois Secretary of State, that the person licensed is 90 days or more delinquent in payment of support under an order of support issued by a court or administrative body of this or any other State. The Secretary of State may reinstate the person's driver's license if notified by the Department of Healthcare and Family Services that the person has paid the support delinquency in full or has arranged for payment of the delinquency and current support obligation in a manner satisfactory to the Department of Healthcare and Family Services.
    (d) The Secretary of State shall suspend the driver's license issued to a person upon receiving an authenticated document provided for in Section 7-703 that the person has been adjudicated as having engaged in visitation abuse and that the court has ordered that the person's driving privileges be suspended. The person's driver's license shall be suspended until such time as the Secretary of State receives authenticated documentation that the court has determined that there has been sufficient compliance for a sufficient period of time with the court's order concerning visitation and that full driving privileges shall be reinstated. When the court order in which the court has determined that there has been sufficient compliance for a sufficient period of time with the court's order concerning visitation and that full driving privileges shall be reinstated, the circuit court shall report that order concerning visitation to the Secretary of State, on a form prescribed by the Secretary of State, and shall order that the person's driver's license be reinstated.

    Sec. 7-702.1. Family financial responsibility driving permits.
    (a) Following the entry of an order that an obligor has been found in contempt by the court for failure to pay court ordered child support payments or upon a motion by the obligor who is subject to having his or her driver's license suspended pursuant to subsection (b) of Section 7-703, the court may enter an order directing the Secretary of State to issue a family financial responsibility driving permit for the purpose of providing the obligor the privilege of operating a motor vehicle between the obligor's residence and place of employment, or within the scope of employment related duties; or for the purpose of providing transportation for the obligor or a household member to receive alcohol treatment, other drug treatment, or medical care. If the obligor is unemployed, the court may issue the order for the purpose of seeking employment, which may be subject to the requirements set forth in subsection (a) of Section 505.1 of the Illinois Marriage and Dissolution of Marriage Act. Except upon a showing of good cause, any permit issued for the purpose of seeking employment shall be limited to Monday through Friday between the hours of 8 a.m. and 12 p.m. The court may enter an order directing the issuance of a permit only if the obligor has proven to the satisfaction of the court that no alternative means of transportation are reasonably available for the above stated purposes. No permit shall be issued to a person under the age of 16 years who possesses an instruction permit.
    Upon entry of an order granting the issuance of a permit to an obligor, the court shall report this finding to the Secretary of State on a form prescribed by the Secretary. This form shall state whether the permit has been granted for employment or medical purposes and the specific days and hours for which limited driving privileges have been granted.

If the person is unemployed, the court may issue the order for the purpose of seeking employment, which may be subject to the requirements set forth in subsection (a) of Section 505.1 of the Illinois Marriage and Dissolution of Marriage Act. Except upon a showing of good cause, any permit issued for the purpose of seeking employment shall be limited to Monday through Friday between the hours of 8 a.m. and 12 p.m. The court may enter an order directing the issuance of a permit only if the person has proven to the satisfaction of the court that no alternative means of transportation are reasonably available for the above stated purposes.

In order for this permit to be issued, an individual's driving privileges must be valid except for the family financial responsibility suspension or the family responsibility suspension. This permit shall be valid only for employment and medical purposes as set forth above. The permit shall state the days and hours for which limited driving privileges have been granted.
    Any submitted court order that contains insufficient data or fails to comply with any provision of this Code shall not be used for issuance of the permit or entered to the individual's driving record but shall be returned to the court of jurisdiction indicating why the permit cannot be issued at that time. The Secretary of State shall also send notice of the return of the court order to the individual requesting the permit.
    (b) Following certification of delinquency pursuant to subsection (c) of Section 7-702 of this Code, and upon petition by the obligor whose driver's license has been suspended under that subsection, the Department of Healthcare and Family Services may direct the Secretary of State to issue a family financial responsibility driving permit for the purpose of providing the obligor the privilege of operating a motor vehicle between the obligor's residence and place of employment, or within the scope of employment related duties, or for the purpose of providing transportation for the obligor or a household member to receive alcohol treatment, other drug treatment, or medical care. If the obligor is unemployed, the Department of Healthcare and Family Services may direct the issuance of the permit for the purpose of seeking employment, which may be subject to the requirements set forth in subsection (a) of Section 505.1 of the Illinois Marriage and Dissolution of Marriage Act. Except upon a showing of good cause, any permit issued for the purpose of seeking employment shall be limited to Monday through Friday between the hours of 8 a.m. and 12 p.m. The Department of Healthcare and Family Services may direct the issuance of a permit only if the obligor has proven to the Department's satisfaction that no alternative means of transportation is reasonably available for the above stated purposes.

    (a) The use and operation by any person or his duly authorized agent or employee of a vehicle over or upon the highways of the State of Illinois, shall be deemed an appointment by such person of the Secretary of State to be his true and lawful attorney upon whom may be served all legal process in any action or proceeding against him, growing out of such use or resulting in damage or loss to person or property, and the use or operation shall be signification of his agreement that such process against him which is so served, shall be of the same legal force and validity as though served upon him personally if such person is a non-resident of this State or at the time a cause of action arises is a resident of this State but subsequently becomes a non-resident of this State, or in the event the vehicle is owned by a non-resident and is being operated over and upon the highways of this State with the owner's express or implied permission.
    (b) Service of such process shall be made by serving a copy upon the Secretary of State or any employee in his office designated by him to accept such service for him, or by filing such copy in his office, together with an affidavit of compliance from the plaintiff instituting the action, suit, or proceeding, which states that this Section is applicable to the proceeding and that the plaintiff has complied with the requirements of this Section, and a fee of $5 and such service shall be sufficient service upon the person, if notice of such service and a copy of the process are, within 10 days thereafter, sent by registered mail by the plaintiff to the defendant, at the last known address of the defendant, and the plaintiff's affidavit of compliance herewith is appended to the summons.
    (c) The court in which the action is pending may order such continuances as may be necessary to afford the defendant reasonable opportunity to defend the action. The fee of $5 paid by the plaintiff to the Secretary of State at the time of the service shall be taxed as his cost, if he prevails in the action.
    (d) The Secretary of State shall keep a record of all such processes, which shall show the day and hour of such service.
    (e) When a final judgment is entered against any non-resident defendant who has not received notice and a copy of the process by registered mail, required to be sent to him as above provided, and such person, his heirs, legatees, executor, administrator or other legal representatives, as the case may require, shall within one year after the written notice given to him of such judgment, or within 5 years after such judgment, if no such notice has been given, as stated above, appear and petition the court to be heard regarding such judgment, and shall pay such costs as the court may deem reasonable in that behalf, the person so petitioning the court may appear and answer the plaintiff's allegations, and thereupon such proceeding shall be had as if the defendant had appeared in due time and no judgment had been entered. If it appears upon the hearing that such judgment ought not to have been entered against the defendant, the judgment may be set aside, altered or amended as shall appear just; otherwise, it shall be ordered that the judgment stands confirmed against the defendant. The judgment shall, after 5 years from the entry thereof, if not set aside in the manner stated above, be deemed and adjudged confirmed against such defendant, and all persons claiming under him by virtue of any act done subsequent to the commencement of such action, and at the end of the 5 years, the court may enter such further orders as shall be required for the enforcement of the judgment.
    (f) Any person instituting any action, suit, or proceeding who uses this Section to effect service of process shall be liable for the attorney's fees and costs of the defendant if the court finds that the person instituting the action knew or should have known that this Section is not applicable for effecting service in such action.

The traffic compliance administrator also may make a certified report to the Secretary of State under Section 6-306.5.
        (2) A parking, standing, compliance, automated speed
    	
enforcement system, or automated traffic law violation notice that shall specify or include the date, time, and place of violation of a parking, standing, compliance, automated speed enforcement system, or automated traffic law regulation; the particular regulation violated; any requirement to complete a traffic education program; the fine and any penalty that may be assessed for late payment or failure to complete a required traffic education program, or both, when so provided by ordinance; the vehicle make or a photograph of the vehicle; the state registration number of the vehicle; and the identification number of the person issuing the notice. With regard to automated speed enforcement system or automated traffic law violations, vehicle make shall be specified on the automated speed enforcement system or automated traffic law violation notice if the notice does not include a photograph of the vehicle and the make is available and readily discernible. With regard to municipalities or counties with a population of 1 million or more, it shall be grounds for dismissal of a parking violation if the state registration number or vehicle make specified is incorrect. The violation notice shall state that the completion of any required traffic education program, the payment of any indicated fine, and the payment of any applicable penalty for late payment or failure to complete a required traffic education program, or both, shall operate as a final disposition of the violation. The notice also shall contain information as to the availability of a hearing in which the violation may be contested on its merits. The violation notice shall specify the time and manner in which a hearing may be had.
        (3) Service of a parking, standing, or compliance
    	
violation notice by: (i) affixing the original or a facsimile of the notice to an unlawfully parked or standing vehicle; (ii) handing the notice to the operator of a vehicle if he or she is present; or (iii) mailing the notice to the address of the registered owner or lessee of the cited vehicle as recorded with the Secretary of State or the lessor of the motor vehicle within 30 days after the Secretary of State or the lessor of the motor vehicle notifies the municipality or county of the identity of the owner or lessee of the vehicle, but not later than 90 days after date of the violation, except that in the case of a lessee of a motor vehicle, service of a parking, standing, or compliance violation notice may occur no later than 210 days after the violation; and service of an automated speed enforcement system or automated traffic law violation notice by mail to the address of the registered owner or lessee of the cited vehicle as recorded with the Secretary of State or the lessor of the motor vehicle within 30 days after the Secretary of State or the lessor of the motor vehicle notifies the municipality or county of the identity of the owner or lessee of the vehicle, but not later than 90 days after the violation, except that in the case of a lessee of a motor vehicle, service of an automated traffic law violation notice may occur no later than 210 days after the violation. A person authorized by ordinance to issue and serve parking, standing, and compliance violation notices shall certify as to the correctness of the facts entered on the violation notice by signing his or her name to the notice at the time of service or in the case of a notice produced by a computerized device, by signing a single certificate to be kept by the traffic compliance administrator attesting to the correctness of all notices produced by the device while it was under his or her control. In the case of an automated traffic law violation, the ordinance shall require a determination by a technician employed or contracted by the municipality or county that, based on inspection of recorded images, the motor vehicle was being operated in violation of Section 11-208.6, 11-208.9, or 11-1201.1 or a local ordinance. If the technician determines that the vehicle entered the intersection as part of a funeral procession or in order to yield the right-of-way to an emergency vehicle, a citation shall not be issued. In municipalities with a population of less than 1,000,000 inhabitants and counties with a population of less than 3,000,000 inhabitants, the automated traffic law ordinance shall require that all determinations by a technician that a motor vehicle was being operated in violation of Section 11-208.6, 11-208.9, or 11-1201.1 or a local ordinance must be reviewed and approved by a law enforcement officer or retired law enforcement officer of the municipality or county issuing the violation. In municipalities with a population of 1,000,000 or more inhabitants and counties with a population of 3,000,000 or more inhabitants, the automated traffic law ordinance shall require that all determinations by a technician that a motor vehicle was being operated in violation of Section 11-208.6, 11-208.9, or 11-1201.1 or a local ordinance must be reviewed and approved by a law enforcement officer or retired law enforcement officer of the municipality or county issuing the violation or by an additional fully-trained reviewing technician who is not employed by the contractor who employs the technician who made the initial determination. In the case of an automated speed enforcement system violation, the ordinance shall require a determination by a technician employed by the municipality, based upon an inspection of recorded images, video or other documentation, including documentation of the speed limit and automated speed enforcement signage, and documentation of the inspection, calibration, and certification of the speed equipment, that the vehicle was being operated in violation of Article VI of Chapter 11 of this Code or a similar local ordinance. If the technician determines that the vehicle speed was not determined by a calibrated, certified speed equipment device based upon the speed equipment documentation, or if the vehicle was an emergency vehicle, a citation may not be issued. The automated speed enforcement ordinance shall require that all determinations by a technician that a violation occurred be reviewed and approved by a law enforcement officer or retired law enforcement officer of the municipality issuing the violation or by an additional fully trained reviewing technician who is not employed by the contractor who employs the technician who made the initial determination. Routine and independent calibration of the speeds produced by automated speed enforcement systems and equipment shall be conducted annually by a qualified technician. Speeds produced by an automated speed enforcement system shall be compared with speeds produced by lidar or other independent equipment. Radar or lidar equipment shall undergo an internal validation test no less frequently than once each week. Qualified technicians shall test loop based equipment no less frequently than once a year. Radar equipment shall be checked for accuracy by a qualified technician when the unit is serviced, when unusual or suspect readings persist, or when deemed necessary by a reviewing technician. Radar equipment shall be checked with the internal frequency generator and the internal circuit test whenever the radar is turned on. Technicians must be alert for any unusual or suspect readings, and if unusual or suspect readings of a radar unit persist, that unit shall immediately be removed from service and not returned to service until it has been checked by a qualified technician and determined to be functioning properly. Documentation of the annual calibration results, including the equipment tested, test date, technician performing the test, and test results, shall be maintained and available for use in the determination of an automated speed enforcement system violation and issuance of a citation. The technician performing the calibration and testing of the automated speed enforcement equipment shall be trained and certified in the use of equipment for speed enforcement purposes. Training on the speed enforcement equipment may be conducted by law enforcement, civilian, or manufacturer's personnel and if applicable may be equivalent to the equipment use and operations training included in the Speed Measuring Device Operator Program developed by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). The vendor or technician who performs the work shall keep accurate records on each piece of equipment the technician calibrates and tests. As used in this paragraph, "fully-trained reviewing technician" means a person who has received at least 40 hours of supervised training in subjects which shall include image inspection and interpretation, the elements necessary to prove a violation, license plate identification, and traffic safety and management. In all municipalities and counties, the automated speed enforcement system or automated traffic law ordinance shall require that no additional fee shall be charged to the alleged violator for exercising his or her right to an administrative hearing, and persons shall be given at least 25 days following an administrative hearing to pay any civil penalty imposed by a finding that Section 11-208.6, 11-208.8, 11-208.9, or 11-1201.1 or a similar local ordinance has been violated. The original or a facsimile of the violation notice or, in the case of a notice produced by a computerized device, a printed record generated by the device showing the facts entered on the notice, shall be retained by the traffic compliance administrator, and shall be a record kept in the ordinary course of business. A parking, standing, compliance, automated speed enforcement system, or automated traffic law violation notice issued, signed and served in accordance with this Section, a copy of the notice, or the computer generated record shall be prima facie correct and shall be prima facie evidence of the correctness of the facts shown on the notice. The notice, copy, or computer generated record shall be admissible in any subsequent administrative or legal proceedings.
        (4) An opportunity for a hearing for the registered
    	
owner of the vehicle cited in the parking, standing, compliance, automated speed enforcement system, or automated traffic law violation notice in which the owner may contest the merits of the alleged violation, and during which formal or technical rules of evidence shall not apply; provided, however, that under Section 11-1306 of this Code the lessee of a vehicle cited in the violation notice likewise shall be provided an opportunity for a hearing of the same kind afforded the registered owner. The hearings shall be recorded, and the person conducting the hearing on behalf of the traffic compliance administrator shall be empowered to administer oaths and to secure by subpoena both the attendance and testimony of witnesses and the production of relevant books and papers. Persons appearing at a hearing under this Section may be represented by counsel at their expense. The ordinance may also provide for internal administrative review following the decision of the hearing officer.
        (5) Service of additional notices, sent by first
    	
class United States mail, postage prepaid, to the address of the registered owner of the cited vehicle as recorded with the Secretary of State or, if any notice to that address is returned as undeliverable, to the last known address recorded in a United States Post Office approved database, or, under Section 11-1306 or subsection (p) of Section 11-208.6 or 11-208.9, or subsection (p) of Section 11-208.8 of this Code, to the lessee of the cited vehicle at the last address known to the lessor of the cited vehicle at the time of lease or, if any notice to that address is returned as undeliverable, to the last known address recorded in a United States Post Office approved database. The service shall be deemed complete as of the date of deposit in the United States mail. The notices shall be in the following sequence and shall include but not be limited to the information specified herein:
            (i) A second notice of parking, standing, or
        	
compliance violation if the first notice of the violation was issued by affixing the original or a facsimile of the notice to the unlawfully parked vehicle or by handing the notice to the operator. This notice shall specify or include the date and location of the violation cited in the parking, standing, or compliance violation notice, the particular regulation violated, the vehicle make or a photograph of the vehicle, the state registration number of the vehicle, any requirement to complete a traffic education program, the fine and any penalty that may be assessed for late payment or failure to complete a traffic education program, or both, when so provided by ordinance, the availability of a hearing in which the violation may be contested on its merits, and the time and manner in which the hearing may be had. The notice of violation shall also state that failure to complete a required traffic education program, to pay the indicated fine and any applicable penalty, or to appear at a hearing on the merits in the time and manner specified, will result in a final determination of violation liability for the cited violation in the amount of the fine or penalty indicated, and that, upon the occurrence of a final determination of violation liability for the failure, and the exhaustion of, or failure to exhaust, available administrative or judicial procedures for review, any incomplete traffic education program or any unpaid fine or penalty, or both, will constitute a debt due and owing the municipality or county.
            (ii) A notice of final determination of parking,
        	
standing, compliance, automated speed enforcement system, or automated traffic law violation liability. This notice shall be sent following a final determination of parking, standing, compliance, automated speed enforcement system, or automated traffic law violation liability and the conclusion of judicial review procedures taken under this Section. The notice shall state that the incomplete traffic education program or the unpaid fine or penalty, or both, is a debt due and owing the municipality or county. The notice shall contain warnings that failure to complete any required traffic education program or to pay any fine or penalty due and owing the municipality or county, or both, within the time specified may result in the municipality's or county's filing of a petition in the Circuit Court to have the incomplete traffic education program or unpaid fine or penalty, or both, rendered a judgment as provided by this Section, or may result in suspension of the person's drivers license for failure to complete a traffic education program or to pay fines or penalties, or both, for 10 or more parking violations under Section 6-306.5, or a combination of 5 or more automated traffic law violations under Section 11-208.6 or 11-208.9 or automated speed enforcement system violations under Section 11-208.8.
        (6) A notice of impending drivers license suspension.
    	
This notice shall be sent to the person liable for failure to complete a required traffic education program or to pay any fine or penalty that remains due and owing, or both, on 10 or more parking violations or combination of 5 or more unpaid automated speed enforcement system or automated traffic law violations. The notice shall state that failure to complete a required traffic education program or to pay the fine or penalty owing, or both, within 45 days of the notice's date will result in the municipality or county notifying the Secretary of State that the person is eligible for initiation of suspension proceedings under Section 6-306.5 of this Code. The notice shall also state that the person may obtain a photostatic copy of an original ticket imposing a fine or penalty by sending a self addressed, stamped envelope to the municipality or county along with a request for the photostatic copy. The notice of impending drivers license suspension shall be sent by first class United States mail, postage prepaid, to the address recorded with the Secretary of State or, if any notice to that address is returned as undeliverable, to the last known address recorded in a United States Post Office approved database.
        (7) Final determinations of violation liability. A
    	
final determination of violation liability shall occur following failure to complete the required traffic education program or to pay the fine or penalty, or both, after a hearing officer's determination of violation liability and the exhaustion of or failure to exhaust any administrative review procedures provided by ordinance. Where a person fails to appear at a hearing to contest the alleged violation in the time and manner specified in a prior mailed notice, the hearing officer's determination of violation liability shall become final: (A) upon denial of a timely petition to set aside that determination, or (B) upon expiration of the period for filing the petition without a filing having been made.
        (8) A petition to set aside a determination of
    	
parking, standing, compliance, automated speed enforcement system, or automated traffic law violation liability that may be filed by a person owing an unpaid fine or penalty. A petition to set aside a determination of liability may also be filed by a person required to complete a traffic education program. The petition shall be filed with and ruled upon by the traffic compliance administrator in the manner and within the time specified by ordinance. The grounds for the petition may be limited to: (A) the person not having been the owner or lessee of the cited vehicle on the date the violation notice was issued, (B) the person having already completed the required traffic education program or paid the fine or penalty, or both, for the violation in question, and (C) excusable failure to appear at or request a new date for a hearing. With regard to municipalities or counties with a population of 1 million or more, it shall be grounds for dismissal of a parking violation if the state registration number or vehicle make, only if specified in the violation notice, is incorrect. After the determination of parking, standing, compliance, automated speed enforcement system, or automated traffic law violation liability has been set aside upon a showing of just cause, the registered owner shall be provided with a hearing on the merits for that violation.
        (9) Procedures for non-residents. Procedures by which
    	
persons who are not residents of the municipality or county may contest the merits of the alleged violation without attending a hearing.
        (10) A schedule of civil fines for violations of
    	
vehicular standing, parking, compliance, automated speed enforcement system, or automated traffic law regulations enacted by ordinance pursuant to this Section, and a schedule of penalties for late payment of the fines or failure to complete required traffic education programs, provided, however, that the total amount of the fine and penalty for any one violation shall not exceed $250, except as provided in subsection (c) of Section 11-1301.3 of this Code.
        (11) Other provisions as are necessary and proper to
    	
carry into effect the powers granted and purposes stated in this Section.
    (c) Any municipality or county establishing vehicular standing, parking, compliance, automated speed enforcement system, or automated traffic law regulations under this Section may also provide by ordinance for a program of vehicle immobilization for the purpose of facilitating enforcement of those regulations. The program of vehicle immobilization shall provide for immobilizing any eligible vehicle upon the public way by presence of a restraint in a manner to prevent operation of the vehicle. Any ordinance establishing a program of vehicle immobilization under this Section shall provide:
        (1) Criteria for the designation of vehicles eligible
    	
for immobilization. A vehicle shall be eligible for immobilization when the registered owner of the vehicle has accumulated the number of incomplete traffic education programs or unpaid final determinations of parking, standing, compliance, automated speed enforcement system, or automated traffic law violation liability, or both, as determined by ordinance.
        (2) A notice of impending vehicle immobilization and
    	
a right to a hearing to challenge the validity of the notice by disproving liability for the incomplete traffic education programs or unpaid final determinations of parking, standing, compliance, automated speed enforcement system, or automated traffic law violation liability, or both, listed on the notice.
        (3) The right to a prompt hearing after a vehicle has
    	
been immobilized or subsequently towed without the completion of the required traffic education program or payment of the outstanding fines and penalties on parking, standing, compliance, automated speed enforcement system, or automated traffic law violations, or both, for which final determinations have been issued. An order issued after the hearing is a final administrative decision within the meaning of Section 3-101 of the Code of Civil Procedure.
        (4) A post immobilization and post-towing notice
    	
advising the registered owner of the vehicle of the right to a hearing to challenge the validity of the impoundment.
    (d) Judicial review of final determinations of parking, standing, compliance, automated speed enforcement system, or automated traffic law violations and final administrative decisions issued after hearings regarding vehicle immobilization and impoundment made under this Section shall be subject to the provisions of the Administrative Review Law.
    (e) Any fine, penalty, incomplete traffic education program, or part of any fine or any penalty remaining unpaid after the exhaustion of, or the failure to exhaust, administrative remedies created under this Section and the conclusion of any judicial review procedures shall be a debt due and owing the municipality or county and, as such, may be collected in accordance with applicable law. Completion of any required traffic education program and payment in full of any fine or penalty resulting from a standing, parking, compliance, automated speed enforcement system, or automated traffic law violation shall constitute a final disposition of that violation.
    (f) After the expiration of the period within which judicial review may be sought for a final determination of parking, standing, compliance, automated speed enforcement system, or automated traffic law violation, the municipality or county may commence a proceeding in the Circuit Court for purposes of obtaining a judgment on the final determination of violation. Nothing in this Section shall prevent a municipality or county from consolidating multiple final determinations of parking, standing, compliance, automated speed enforcement system, or automated traffic law violations against a person in a proceeding. Upon commencement of the action, the municipality or county shall file a certified copy or record of the final determination of parking, standing, compliance, automated speed enforcement system, or automated traffic law violation, which shall be accompanied by a certification that recites facts sufficient to show that the final determination of violation was issued in accordance with this Section and the applicable municipal or county ordinance. Service of the summons and a copy of the petition may be by any method provided by Section 2-203 of the Code of Civil Procedure or by certified mail, return receipt requested, provided that the total amount of fines and penalties for final determinations of parking, standing, compliance, automated speed enforcement system, or automated traffic law violations does not exceed $2500. If the court is satisfied that the final determination of parking, standing, compliance, automated speed enforcement system, or automated traffic law violation was entered in accordance with the requirements of this Section and the applicable municipal or county ordinance, and that the registered owner or the lessee, as the case may be, had an opportunity for an administrative hearing and for judicial review as provided in this Section, the court shall render judgment in favor of the municipality or county and against the registered owner or the lessee for the amount indicated in the final determination of parking, standing, compliance, automated speed enforcement system, or automated traffic law violation, plus costs. The judgment shall have the same effect and may be enforced in the same manner as other judgments for the recovery of money.
    (g) The fee for participating in a traffic education program under this Section shall not exceed $25.
    A low-income individual required to complete a traffic education program under this Section who provides proof of eligibility for the federal earned income tax credit under Section 32 of the Internal Revenue Code or the Illinois earned income tax credit under Section 212 of the Illinois Income Tax Act shall not be required to pay any fee for participating in a required traffic education program.

    (Text of Section from P.A. 101-623)
    Sec. 11-208.3. Administrative adjudication of violations of traffic regulations concerning the standing, parking, or condition of vehicles, automated traffic law violations, and automated speed enforcement system violations.
    (a) Any municipality or county may provide by ordinance for a system of administrative adjudication of vehicular standing and parking violations and vehicle compliance violations as described in this subsection, automated traffic law violations as defined in Section 11-208.6, 11-208.9, or 11-1201.1, and automated speed enforcement system violations as defined in Section 11-208.8. The administrative system shall have as its purpose the fair and efficient enforcement of municipal or county regulations through the administrative adjudication of automated speed enforcement system or automated traffic law violations and violations of municipal or county ordinances regulating the standing and parking of vehicles, the condition and use of vehicle equipment, and the display of municipal or county wheel tax licenses within the municipality's or county's borders. The administrative system shall only have authority to adjudicate civil offenses carrying fines not in excess of $500 or requiring the completion of a traffic education program, or both, that occur after the effective date of the ordinance adopting such a system under this Section. For purposes of this Section, "compliance violation" means a violation of a municipal or county regulation governing the condition or use of equipment on a vehicle or governing the display of a municipal or county wheel tax license.
    (b) Any ordinance establishing a system of administrative adjudication under this Section shall provide for:
        (1) A traffic compliance administrator authorized to
    	
adopt, distribute and process parking, compliance, and automated speed enforcement system or automated traffic law violation notices and other notices required by this Section, collect money paid as fines and penalties for violation of parking and compliance ordinances and automated speed enforcement system or automated traffic law violations, and operate an administrative adjudication system. The traffic compliance administrator also may make a certified report to the Secretary of State under Section 6-306.5.
        (2) A parking, standing, compliance, automated speed
    	
enforcement system, or automated traffic law violation notice that shall specify the date, time, and place of violation of a parking, standing, compliance, automated speed enforcement system, or automated traffic law regulation; the particular regulation violated; any requirement to complete a traffic education program; the fine and any penalty that may be assessed for late payment or failure to complete a required traffic education program, or both, when so provided by ordinance; the vehicle make and state registration number; and the identification number of the person issuing the notice. With regard to automated speed enforcement system or automated traffic law violations, vehicle make shall be specified on the automated speed enforcement system or automated traffic law violation notice if the make is available and readily discernible. With regard to municipalities or counties with a population of 1 million or more, it shall be grounds for dismissal of a parking violation if the state registration number or vehicle make specified is incorrect. The violation notice shall state that the completion of any required traffic education program, the payment of any indicated fine, and the payment of any applicable penalty for late payment or failure to complete a required traffic education program, or both, shall operate as a final disposition of the violation. The notice also shall contain information as to the availability of a hearing in which the violation may be contested on its merits. The violation notice shall specify the time and manner in which a hearing may be had.
        (3) Service of the parking, standing, or compliance

A person authorized by ordinance to issue and serve parking, standing, and compliance violation notices shall certify as to the correctness of the facts entered on the violation notice by signing his or her name to the notice at the time of service or in the case of a notice produced by a computerized device, by signing a single certificate to be kept by the traffic compliance administrator attesting to the correctness of all notices produced by the device while it was under his or her control. In the case of an automated traffic law violation, the ordinance shall require a determination by a technician employed or contracted by the municipality or county that, based on inspection of recorded images, the motor vehicle was being operated in violation of Section 11-208.6, 11-208.9, or 11-1201.1 or a local ordinance. If the technician determines that the vehicle entered the intersection as part of a funeral procession or in order to yield the right-of-way to an emergency vehicle, a citation shall not be issued. In municipalities with a population of less than 1,000,000 inhabitants and counties with a population of less than 3,000,000 inhabitants, the automated traffic law ordinance shall require that all determinations by a technician that a motor vehicle was being operated in violation of Section 11-208.6, 11-208.9, or 11-1201.1 or a local ordinance must be reviewed and approved by a law enforcement officer or retired law enforcement officer of the municipality or county issuing the violation. In municipalities with a population of 1,000,000 or more inhabitants and counties with a population of 3,000,000 or more inhabitants, the automated traffic law ordinance shall require that all determinations by a technician that a motor vehicle was being operated in violation of Section 11-208.6, 11-208.9, or 11-1201.1 or a local ordinance must be reviewed and approved by a law enforcement officer or retired law enforcement officer of the municipality or county issuing the violation or by an additional fully-trained reviewing technician who is not employed by the contractor who employs the technician who made the initial determination. In the case of an automated speed enforcement system violation, the ordinance shall require a determination by a technician employed by the municipality, based upon an inspection of recorded images, video or other documentation, including documentation of the speed limit and automated speed enforcement signage, and documentation of the inspection, calibration, and certification of the speed equipment, that the vehicle was being operated in violation of Article VI of Chapter 11 of this Code or a similar local ordinance. If the technician determines that the vehicle speed was not determined by a calibrated, certified speed equipment device based upon the speed equipment documentation, or if the vehicle was an emergency vehicle, a citation may not be issued. The automated speed enforcement ordinance shall require that all determinations by a technician that a violation occurred be reviewed and approved by a law enforcement officer or retired law enforcement officer of the municipality issuing the violation or by an additional fully trained reviewing technician who is not employed by the contractor who employs the technician who made the initial determination.

Documentation of the annual calibration results, including the equipment tested, test date, technician performing the test, and test results, shall be maintained and available for use in the determination of an automated speed enforcement system violation and issuance of a citation. The technician performing the calibration and testing of the automated speed enforcement equipment shall be trained and certified in the use of equipment for speed enforcement purposes. Training on the speed enforcement equipment may be conducted by law enforcement, civilian, or manufacturer's personnel and if applicable may be equivalent to the equipment use and operations training included in the Speed Measuring Device Operator Program developed by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). The vendor or technician who performs the work shall keep accurate records on each piece of equipment the technician calibrates and tests. As used in this paragraph, "fully-trained reviewing technician" means a person who has received at least 40 hours of supervised training in subjects which shall include image inspection and interpretation, the elements necessary to prove a violation, license plate identification, and traffic safety and management. In all municipalities and counties, the automated speed enforcement system or automated traffic law ordinance shall require that no additional fee shall be charged to the alleged violator for exercising his or her right to an administrative hearing, and persons shall be given at least 25 days following an administrative hearing to pay any civil penalty imposed by a finding that Section 11-208.6, 11-208.8, 11-208.9, or 11-1201.1 or a similar local ordinance has been violated. The original or a facsimile of the violation notice or, in the case of a notice produced by a computerized device, a printed record generated by the device showing the facts entered on the notice, shall be retained by the traffic compliance administrator, and shall be a record kept in the ordinary course of business. A parking, standing, compliance, automated speed enforcement system, or automated traffic law violation notice issued, signed and served in accordance with this Section, a copy of the notice, or the computer generated record shall be prima facie correct and shall be prima facie evidence of the correctness of the facts shown on the notice. The notice, copy, or computer generated record shall be admissible in any subsequent administrative or legal proceedings.
        (4) An opportunity for a hearing for the registered
    	
owner of the vehicle cited in the parking, standing, compliance, automated speed enforcement system, or automated traffic law violation notice in which the owner may contest the merits of the alleged violation, and during which formal or technical rules of evidence shall not apply; provided, however, that under Section 11-1306 of this Code the lessee of a vehicle cited in the violation notice likewise shall be provided an opportunity for a hearing of the same kind afforded the registered owner. The hearings shall be recorded, and the person conducting the hearing on behalf of the traffic compliance administrator shall be empowered to administer oaths and to secure by subpoena both the attendance and testimony of witnesses and the production of relevant books and papers. Persons appearing at a hearing under this Section may be represented by counsel at their expense. The ordinance may also provide for internal administrative review following the decision of the hearing officer.
        (5) Service of additional notices, sent by first
    	
class United States mail, postage prepaid, to the address of the registered owner of the cited vehicle as recorded with the Secretary of State or, if any notice to that address is returned as undeliverable, to the last known address recorded in a United States Post Office approved database, or, under Section 11-1306 or subsection (p) of Section 11-208.6 or 11-208.9, or subsection (p) of Section 11-208.8 of this Code, to the lessee of the cited vehicle at the last address known to the lessor of the cited vehicle at the time of lease or, if any notice to that address is returned as undeliverable, to the last known address recorded in a United States Post Office approved database.

The notice of violation shall also state that failure to complete a required traffic education program, to pay the indicated fine and any applicable penalty, or to appear at a hearing on the merits in the time and manner specified, will result in a final determination of violation liability for the cited violation in the amount of the fine or penalty indicated, and that, upon the occurrence of a final determination of violation liability for the failure, and the exhaustion of, or failure to exhaust, available administrative or judicial procedures for review, any incomplete traffic education program or any unpaid fine or penalty, or both, will constitute a debt due and owing the municipality or county.
            (ii) A notice of final determination of parking,
        	
standing, compliance, automated speed enforcement system, or automated traffic law violation liability. This notice shall be sent following a final determination of parking, standing, compliance, automated speed enforcement system, or automated traffic law violation liability and the conclusion of judicial review procedures taken under this Section.

The notice shall also state that the person may obtain a photostatic copy of an original ticket imposing a fine or penalty by sending a self addressed, stamped envelope to the municipality or county along with a request for the photostatic copy. The notice of impending drivers license suspension shall be sent by first class United States mail, postage prepaid, to the address recorded with the Secretary of State or, if any notice to that address is returned as undeliverable, to the last known address recorded in a United States Post Office approved database.
        (7) Final determinations of violation liability. A
    	
final determination of violation liability shall occur following failure to complete the required traffic education program or to pay the fine or penalty, or both, after a hearing officer's determination of violation liability and the exhaustion of or failure to exhaust any administrative review procedures provided by ordinance. Where a person fails to appear at a hearing to contest the alleged violation in the time and manner specified in a prior mailed notice, the hearing officer's determination of violation liability shall become final: (A) upon denial of a timely petition to set aside that determination, or (B) upon expiration of the period for filing the petition without a filing having been made.
        (8) A petition to set aside a determination of
    	
parking, standing, compliance, automated speed enforcement system, or automated traffic law violation liability that may be filed by a person owing an unpaid fine or penalty. A petition to set aside a determination of liability may also be filed by a person required to complete a traffic education program. The petition shall be filed with and ruled upon by the traffic compliance administrator in the manner and within the time specified by ordinance. The grounds for the petition may be limited to: (A) the person not having been the owner or lessee of the cited vehicle on the date the violation notice was issued, (B) the person having already completed the required traffic education program or paid the fine or penalty, or both, for the violation in question, and (C) excusable failure to appear at or request a new date for a hearing. With regard to municipalities or counties with a population of 1 million or more, it shall be grounds for dismissal of a parking violation if the state registration number, or vehicle make if specified, is incorrect. After the determination of parking, standing, compliance, automated speed enforcement system, or automated traffic law violation liability has been set aside upon a showing of just cause, the registered owner shall be provided with a hearing on the merits for that violation.
        (9) Procedures for non-residents. Procedures by which
    	
persons who are not residents of the municipality or county may contest the merits of the alleged violation without attending a hearing.
        (10) A schedule of civil fines for violations of
    	
vehicular standing, parking, compliance, automated speed enforcement system, or automated traffic law regulations enacted by ordinance pursuant to this Section, and a schedule of penalties for late payment of the fines or failure to complete required traffic education programs, provided, however, that the total amount of the fine and penalty for any one violation shall not exceed $250, except as provided in subsection (c) of Section 11-1301.3 of this Code.
        (11) Other provisions as are necessary and proper to
    	
carry into effect the powers granted and purposes stated in this Section.
    (c) Any municipality or county establishing vehicular standing, parking, compliance, automated speed enforcement system, or automated traffic law regulations under this Section may also provide by ordinance for a program of vehicle immobilization for the purpose of facilitating enforcement of those regulations. The program of vehicle immobilization shall provide for immobilizing any eligible vehicle upon the public way by presence of a restraint in a manner to prevent operation of the vehicle. Any ordinance establishing a program of vehicle immobilization under this Section shall provide:
        (1) Criteria for the designation of vehicles eligible
    	
for immobilization. A vehicle shall be eligible for immobilization when the registered owner of the vehicle has accumulated the number of incomplete traffic education programs or unpaid final determinations of parking, standing, compliance, automated speed enforcement system, or automated traffic law violation liability, or both, as determined by ordinance.
        (2) A notice of impending vehicle immobilization and
    	
a right to a hearing to challenge the validity of the notice by disproving liability for the incomplete traffic education programs or unpaid final determinations of parking, standing, compliance, automated speed enforcement system, or automated traffic law violation liability, or both, listed on the notice.
        (3) The right to a prompt hearing after a vehicle has
    	
been immobilized or subsequently towed without the completion of the required traffic education program or payment of the outstanding fines and penalties on parking, standing, compliance, automated speed enforcement system, or automated traffic law violations, or both, for which final determinations have been issued. An order issued after the hearing is a final administrative decision within the meaning of Section 3-101 of the Code of Civil Procedure.
        (4) A post immobilization and post-towing notice
    	
advising the registered owner of the vehicle of the right to a hearing to challenge the validity of the impoundment.
    (d) Judicial review of final determinations of parking, standing, compliance, automated speed enforcement system, or automated traffic law violations and final administrative decisions issued after hearings regarding vehicle immobilization and impoundment made under this Section shall be subject to the provisions of the Administrative Review Law.
    (e) Any fine, penalty, incomplete traffic education program, or part of any fine or any penalty remaining unpaid after the exhaustion of, or the failure to exhaust, administrative remedies created under this Section and the conclusion of any judicial review procedures shall be a debt due and owing the municipality or county and, as such, may be collected in accordance with applicable law. Completion of any required traffic education program and payment in full of any fine or penalty resulting from a standing, parking, compliance, automated speed enforcement system, or automated traffic law violation shall constitute a final disposition of that violation.
    (f) After the expiration of the period within which judicial review may be sought for a final determination of parking, standing, compliance, automated speed enforcement system, or automated traffic law violation, the municipality or county may commence a proceeding in the Circuit Court for purposes of obtaining a judgment on the final determination of violation. Nothing in this Section shall prevent a municipality or county from consolidating multiple final determinations of parking, standing, compliance, automated speed enforcement system, or automated traffic law violations against a person in a proceeding. Upon commencement of the action, the municipality or county shall file a certified copy or record of the final determination of parking, standing, compliance, automated speed enforcement system, or automated traffic law violation, which shall be accompanied by a certification that recites facts sufficient to show that the final determination of violation was issued in accordance with this Section and the applicable municipal or county ordinance. Service of the summons and a copy of the petition may be by any method provided by Section 2-203 of the Code of Civil Procedure or by certified mail, return receipt requested, provided that the total amount of fines and penalties for final determinations of parking, standing, compliance, automated speed enforcement system, or automated traffic law violations does not exceed $2500. If the court is satisfied that the final determination of parking, standing, compliance, automated speed enforcement system, or automated traffic law violation was entered in accordance with the requirements of this Section and the applicable municipal or county ordinance, and that the registered owner or the lessee, as the case may be, had an opportunity for an administrative hearing and for judicial review as provided in this Section, the court shall render judgment in favor of the municipality or county and against the registered owner or the lessee for the amount indicated in the final determination of parking, standing, compliance, automated speed enforcement system, or automated traffic law violation, plus costs. The judgment shall have the same effect and may be enforced in the same manner as other judgments for the recovery of money.
    (g) The fee for participating in a traffic education program under this Section shall not exceed $25.
    A low-income individual required to complete a traffic education program under this Section who provides proof of eligibility for the federal earned income tax credit under Section 32 of the Internal Revenue Code or the Illinois earned income tax credit under Section 212 of the Illinois Income Tax Act shall not be required to pay any fee for participating in a required traffic education program.

    (Text of Section after amendment by P.A. 101-652)
    Sec. 11-208.3. Administrative adjudication of violations of traffic regulations concerning the standing, parking, or condition of vehicles, automated traffic law violations, and automated speed enforcement system violations.
    (a) Any municipality or county may provide by ordinance for a system of administrative adjudication of vehicular standing and parking violations and vehicle compliance violations as described in this subsection, automated traffic law violations as defined in Section 11-208.6, 11-208.9, or 11-1201.1, and automated speed enforcement system violations as defined in Section 11-208.8. The administrative system shall have as its purpose the fair and efficient enforcement of municipal or county regulations through the administrative adjudication of automated speed enforcement system or automated traffic law violations and violations of municipal or county ordinances regulating the standing and parking of vehicles, the condition and use of vehicle equipment, and the display of municipal or county wheel tax licenses within the municipality's or county's borders. The administrative system shall only have authority to adjudicate civil offenses carrying fines not in excess of $500 or requiring the completion of a traffic education program, or both, that occur after the effective date of the ordinance adopting such a system under this Section. For purposes of this Section, "compliance violation" means a violation of a municipal or county regulation governing the condition or use of equipment on a vehicle or governing the display of a municipal or county wheel tax license.
    (b) Any ordinance establishing a system of administrative adjudication under this Section shall provide for:
        (1) A traffic compliance administrator authorized to
    	
adopt, distribute, and process parking, compliance, and automated speed enforcement system or automated traffic law violation notices and other notices required by this Section, collect money paid as fines and penalties for violation of parking and compliance ordinances and automated speed enforcement system or automated traffic law violations, and operate an administrative adjudication system.
        (2) A parking, standing, compliance, automated speed
    	
enforcement system, or automated traffic law violation notice that shall specify or include the date, time, and place of violation of a parking, standing, compliance, automated speed enforcement system, or automated traffic law regulation; the particular regulation violated; any requirement to complete a traffic education program; the fine and any penalty that may be assessed for late payment or failure to complete a required traffic education program, or both, when so provided by ordinance; the vehicle make or a photograph of the vehicle; the state registration number of the vehicle; and the identification number of the person issuing the notice. With regard to automated speed enforcement system or automated traffic law violations, vehicle make shall be specified on the automated speed enforcement system or automated traffic law violation notice if the notice does not include a photograph of the vehicle and the make is available and readily discernible. With regard to municipalities or counties with a population of 1 million or more, it shall be grounds for dismissal of a parking violation if the state registration number or vehicle make specified is incorrect. The violation notice shall state that the completion of any required traffic education program, the payment of any indicated fine, and the payment of any applicable penalty for late payment or failure to complete a required traffic education program, or both, shall operate as a final disposition of the violation. The notice also shall contain information as to the availability of a hearing in which the violation may be contested on its merits. The violation notice shall specify the time and manner in which a hearing may be had.
        (3) Service of a parking, standing, or compliance
    	
violation notice by: (i) affixing the original or a facsimile of the notice to an unlawfully parked or standing vehicle; (ii) handing the notice to the operator of a vehicle if he or she is present; or (iii) mailing the notice to the address of the registered owner or lessee of the cited vehicle as recorded with the Secretary of State or the lessor of the motor vehicle within 30 days after the Secretary of State or the lessor of the motor vehicle notifies the municipality or county of the identity of the owner or lessee of the vehicle, but not later than 90 days after the date of the violation, except that in the case of a lessee of a motor vehicle, service of a parking, standing, or compliance violation notice may occur no later than 210 days after the violation; and service of an automated speed enforcement system or automated traffic law violation notice by mail to the address of the registered owner or lessee of the cited vehicle as recorded with the Secretary of State or the lessor of the motor vehicle within 30 days after the Secretary of State or the lessor of the motor vehicle notifies the municipality or county of the identity of the owner or lessee of the vehicle, but not later than 90 days after the violation, except that in the case of a lessee of a motor vehicle, service of an automated traffic law violation notice may occur no later than 210 days after the violation. A person authorized by ordinance to issue and serve parking, standing, and compliance violation notices shall certify as to the correctness of the facts entered on the violation notice by signing his or her name to the notice at the time of service or, in the case of a notice produced by a computerized device, by signing a single certificate to be kept by the traffic compliance administrator attesting to the correctness of all notices produced by the device while it was under his or her control. In the case of an automated traffic law violation, the ordinance shall require a determination by a technician employed or contracted by the municipality or county that, based on inspection of recorded images, the motor vehicle was being operated in violation of Section 11-208.6, 11-208.9, or 11-1201.1 or a local ordinance. If the technician determines that the vehicle entered the intersection as part of a funeral procession or in order to yield the right-of-way to an emergency vehicle, a citation shall not be issued. In municipalities with a population of less than 1,000,000 inhabitants and counties with a population of less than 3,000,000 inhabitants, the automated traffic law ordinance shall require that all determinations by a technician that a motor vehicle was being operated in violation of Section 11-208.6, 11-208.9, or 11-1201.1 or a local ordinance must be reviewed and approved by a law enforcement officer or retired law enforcement officer of the municipality or county issuing the violation. In municipalities with a population of 1,000,000 or more inhabitants and counties with a population of 3,000,000 or more inhabitants, the automated traffic law ordinance shall require that all determinations by a technician that a motor vehicle was being operated in violation of Section 11-208.6, 11-208.9, or 11-1201.1 or a local ordinance must be reviewed and approved by a law enforcement officer or retired law enforcement officer of the municipality or county issuing the violation or by an additional fully trained reviewing technician who is not employed by the contractor who employs the technician who made the initial determination. In the case of an automated speed enforcement system violation, the ordinance shall require a determination by a technician employed by the municipality, based upon an inspection of recorded images, video or other documentation, including documentation of the speed limit and automated speed enforcement signage, and documentation of the inspection, calibration, and certification of the speed equipment, that the vehicle was being operated in violation of Article VI of Chapter 11 of this Code or a similar local ordinance. If the technician determines that the vehicle speed was not determined by a calibrated, certified speed equipment device based upon the speed equipment documentation, or if the vehicle was an emergency vehicle, a citation may not be issued. The automated speed enforcement ordinance shall require that all determinations by a technician that a violation occurred be reviewed and approved by a law enforcement officer or retired law enforcement officer of the municipality issuing the violation or by an additional fully trained reviewing technician who is not employed by the contractor who employs the technician who made the initial determination. Routine and independent calibration of the speeds produced by automated speed enforcement systems and equipment shall be conducted annually by a qualified technician. Speeds produced by an automated speed enforcement system shall be compared with speeds produced by lidar or other independent equipment. Radar or lidar equipment shall undergo an internal validation test no less frequently than once each week. Qualified technicians shall test loop-based equipment no less frequently than once a year. Radar equipment shall be checked for accuracy by a qualified technician when the unit is serviced, when unusual or suspect readings persist, or when deemed necessary by a reviewing technician. Radar equipment shall be checked with the internal frequency generator and the internal circuit test whenever the radar is turned on. Technicians must be alert for any unusual or suspect readings, and if unusual or suspect readings of a radar unit persist, that unit shall immediately be removed from service and not returned to service until it has been checked by a qualified technician and determined to be functioning properly. Documentation of the annual calibration results, including the equipment tested, test date, technician performing the test, and test results, shall be maintained and available for use in the determination of an automated speed enforcement system violation and issuance of a citation. The technician performing the calibration and testing of the automated speed enforcement equipment shall be trained and certified in the use of equipment for speed enforcement purposes. Training on the speed enforcement equipment may be conducted by law enforcement, civilian, or manufacturer's personnel and if applicable may be equivalent to the equipment use and operations training included in the Speed Measuring Device Operator Program developed by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). The vendor or technician who performs the work shall keep accurate records on each piece of equipment the technician calibrates and tests. As used in this paragraph, "fully trained reviewing technician" means a person who has received at least 40 hours of supervised training in subjects which shall include image inspection and interpretation, the elements necessary to prove a violation, license plate identification, and traffic safety and management. In all municipalities and counties, the automated speed enforcement system or automated traffic law ordinance shall require that no additional fee shall be charged to the alleged violator for exercising his or her right to an administrative hearing, and persons shall be given at least 25 days following an administrative hearing to pay any civil penalty imposed by a finding that Section 11-208.6, 11-208.8, 11-208.9, or 11-1201.1 or a similar local ordinance has been violated. The original or a facsimile of the violation notice or, in the case of a notice produced by a computerized device, a printed record generated by the device showing the facts entered on the notice, shall be retained by the traffic compliance administrator, and shall be a record kept in the ordinary course of business. A parking, standing, compliance, automated speed enforcement system, or automated traffic law violation notice issued, signed, and served in accordance with this Section, a copy of the notice, or the computer-generated record shall be prima facie correct and shall be prima facie evidence of the correctness of the facts shown on the notice. The notice, copy, or computer-generated record shall be admissible in any subsequent administrative or legal proceedings.
        (4) An opportunity for a hearing for the registered
    	
owner of the vehicle cited in the parking, standing, compliance, automated speed enforcement system, or automated traffic law violation notice in which the owner may contest the merits of the alleged violation, and during which formal or technical rules of evidence shall not apply; provided, however, that under Section 11-1306 of this Code the lessee of a vehicle cited in the violation notice likewise shall be provided an opportunity for a hearing of the same kind afforded the registered owner. The hearings shall be recorded, and the person conducting the hearing on behalf of the traffic compliance administrator shall be empowered to administer oaths and to secure by subpoena both the attendance and testimony of witnesses and the production of relevant books and papers. Persons appearing at a hearing under this Section may be represented by counsel at their expense. The ordinance may also provide for internal administrative review following the decision of the hearing officer.
        (5) Service of additional notices, sent by first
    	
class United States mail, postage prepaid, to the address of the registered owner of the cited vehicle as recorded with the Secretary of State or, if any notice to that address is returned as undeliverable, to the last known address recorded in a United States Post Office approved database, or, under Section 11-1306 or subsection (p) of Section 11-208.6 or 11-208.9, or subsection (p) of Section 11-208.8 of this Code, to the lessee of the cited vehicle at the last address known to the lessor of the cited vehicle at the time of lease or, if any notice to that address is returned as undeliverable, to the last known address recorded in a United States Post Office approved database. The service shall be deemed complete as of the date of deposit in the United States mail. The notices shall be in the following sequence and shall include, but not be limited to, the information specified herein:
            (i) A second notice of parking, standing, or
        	
compliance violation if the first notice of the violation was issued by affixing the original or a facsimile of the notice to the unlawfully parked vehicle or by handing the notice to the operator. This notice shall specify or include the date and location of the violation cited in the parking, standing, or compliance violation notice, the particular regulation violated, the vehicle make or a photograph of the vehicle, the state registration number of the vehicle, any requirement to complete a traffic education program, the fine and any penalty that may be assessed for late payment or failure to complete a traffic education program, or both, when so provided by ordinance, the availability of a hearing in which the violation may be contested on its merits, and the time and manner in which the hearing may be had. The notice of violation shall also state that failure to complete a required traffic education program, to pay the indicated fine and any applicable penalty, or to appear at a hearing on the merits in the time and manner specified, will result in a final determination of violation liability for the cited violation in the amount of the fine or penalty indicated, and that, upon the occurrence of a final determination of violation liability for the failure, and the exhaustion of, or failure to exhaust, available administrative or judicial procedures for review, any incomplete traffic education program or any unpaid fine or penalty, or both, will constitute a debt due and owing the municipality or county.
            (ii) A notice of final determination of parking,
        	
standing, compliance, automated speed enforcement system, or automated traffic law violation liability. This notice shall be sent following a final determination of parking, standing, compliance, automated speed enforcement system, or automated traffic law violation liability and the conclusion of judicial review procedures taken under this Section. The notice shall state that the incomplete traffic education program or the unpaid fine or penalty, or both, is a debt due and owing the municipality or county. The notice shall contain warnings that failure to complete any required traffic education program or to pay any fine or penalty due and owing the municipality or county, or both, within the time specified may result in the municipality's or county's filing of a petition in the Circuit Court to have the incomplete traffic education program or unpaid fine or penalty, or both, rendered a judgment as provided by this Section, or, where applicable, may result in suspension of the person's driver's license for failure to complete a traffic education program.
        (6) A notice of impending driver's license
    	
suspension. This notice shall be sent to the person liable for failure to complete a required traffic education program.

The notice shall also state that the person may obtain a photostatic copy of an original ticket imposing a fine or penalty by sending a self-addressed, stamped envelope to the municipality or county along with a request for the photostatic copy. The notice of impending driver's license suspension shall be sent by first class United States mail, postage prepaid, to the address recorded with the Secretary of State or, if any notice to that address is returned as undeliverable, to the last known address recorded in a United States Post Office approved database.
        (7) Final determinations of violation liability. A
    	
final determination of violation liability shall occur following failure to complete the required traffic education program or to pay the fine or penalty, or both, after a hearing officer's determination of violation liability and the exhaustion of or failure to exhaust any administrative review procedures provided by ordinance. Where a person fails to appear at a hearing to contest the alleged violation in the time and manner specified in a prior mailed notice, the hearing officer's determination of violation liability shall become final: (A) upon denial of a timely petition to set aside that determination, or (B) upon expiration of the period for filing the petition without a filing having been made.
        (8) A petition to set aside a determination of
    	
parking, standing, compliance, automated speed enforcement system, or automated traffic law violation liability that may be filed by a person owing an unpaid fine or penalty. A petition to set aside a determination of liability may also be filed by a person required to complete a traffic education program. The petition shall be filed with and ruled upon by the traffic compliance administrator in the manner and within the time specified by ordinance. The grounds for the petition may be limited to: (A) the person not having been the owner or lessee of the cited vehicle on the date the violation notice was issued, (B) the person having already completed the required traffic education program or paid the fine or penalty, or both, for the violation in question, and (C) excusable failure to appear at or request a new date for a hearing. With regard to municipalities or counties with a population of 1 million or more, it shall be grounds for dismissal of a parking violation if the state registration number or vehicle make, only if specified in the violation notice, is incorrect. After the determination of parking, standing, compliance, automated speed enforcement system, or automated traffic law violation liability has been set aside upon a showing of just cause, the registered owner shall be provided with a hearing on the merits for that violation.
        (9) Procedures for non-residents. Procedures by which
    	
persons who are not residents of the municipality or county may contest the merits of the alleged violation without attending a hearing.

        (11) Other provisions as are necessary and proper to
    	
carry into effect the powers granted and purposes stated in this Section.
    (c) Any municipality or county establishing vehicular standing, parking, compliance, automated speed enforcement system, or automated traffic law regulations under this Section may also provide by ordinance for a program of vehicle immobilization for the purpose of facilitating enforcement of those regulations. The program of vehicle immobilization shall provide for immobilizing any eligible vehicle upon the public way by presence of a restraint in a manner to prevent operation of the vehicle. Any ordinance establishing a program of vehicle immobilization under this Section shall provide:
        (1) Criteria for the designation of vehicles eligible
    	
for immobilization. A vehicle shall be eligible for immobilization when the registered owner of the vehicle has accumulated the number of incomplete traffic education programs or unpaid final determinations of parking, standing, compliance, automated speed enforcement system, or automated traffic law violation liability, or both, as determined by ordinance.
        (2) A notice of impending vehicle immobilization and

Completion of any required traffic education program and payment in full of any fine or penalty resulting from a standing, parking, compliance, automated speed enforcement system, or automated traffic law violation shall constitute a final disposition of that violation.
    (f) After the expiration of the period within which judicial review may be sought for a final determination of parking, standing, compliance, automated speed enforcement system, or automated traffic law violation, the municipality or county may commence a proceeding in the Circuit Court for purposes of obtaining a judgment on the final determination of violation. Nothing in this Section shall prevent a municipality or county from consolidating multiple final determinations of parking, standing, compliance, automated speed enforcement system, or automated traffic law violations against a person in a proceeding.

    (Text of Section before amendment by P.A. 101-652)
    Sec. 11-208.6. Automated traffic law enforcement system.
    (a) As used in this Section, "automated traffic law enforcement system" means a device with one or more motor vehicle sensors working in conjunction with a red light signal to produce recorded images of motor vehicles entering an intersection against a red signal indication in violation of Section 11-306 of this Code or a similar provision of a local ordinance.
    An automated traffic law enforcement system is a system, in a municipality or county operated by a governmental agency, that produces a recorded image of a motor vehicle's violation of a provision of this Code or a local ordinance and is designed to obtain a clear recorded image of the vehicle and the vehicle's license plate. The recorded image must also display the time, date, and location of the violation.
    (b) As used in this Section, "recorded images" means images recorded by an automated traffic law enforcement system on:
        (1) 2 or more photographs;
        (2) 2 or more microphotographs;
        (3) 2 or more electronic images; or
        (4) a video recording showing the motor vehicle and,
    	
on at least one image or portion of the recording, clearly identifying the registration plate or digital registration plate number of the motor vehicle.
    (b-5) A municipality or county that produces a recorded image of a motor vehicle's violation of a provision of this Code or a local ordinance must make the recorded images of a violation accessible to the alleged violator by providing the alleged violator with a website address, accessible through the Internet.
    (c) Except as provided under Section 11-208.8 of this Code, a county or municipality, including a home rule county or municipality, may not use an automated traffic law enforcement system to provide recorded images of a motor vehicle for the purpose of recording its speed. Except as provided under Section 11-208.8 of this Code, the regulation of the use of automated traffic law enforcement systems to record vehicle speeds is an exclusive power and function of the State. This subsection (c) is a denial and limitation of home rule powers and functions under subsection (h) of Section 6 of Article VII of the Illinois Constitution.
    (c-5) A county or municipality, including a home rule county or municipality, may not use an automated traffic law enforcement system to issue violations in instances where the motor vehicle comes to a complete stop and does not enter the intersection, as defined by Section 1-132 of this Code, during the cycle of the red signal indication unless one or more pedestrians or bicyclists are present, even if the motor vehicle stops at a point past a stop line or crosswalk where a driver is required to stop, as specified in subsection (c) of Section 11-306 of this Code or a similar provision of a local ordinance.
    (c-6) A county, or a municipality with less than 2,000,000 inhabitants, including a home rule county or municipality, may not use an automated traffic law enforcement system to issue violations in instances where a motorcyclist enters an intersection against a red signal indication when the red signal fails to change to a green signal within a reasonable period of time not less than 120 seconds because of a signal malfunction or because the signal has failed to detect the arrival of the motorcycle due to the motorcycle's size or weight.
    (d) For each violation of a provision of this Code or a local ordinance recorded by an automatic traffic law enforcement system, the county or municipality having jurisdiction shall issue a written notice of the violation to the registered owner of the vehicle as the alleged violator. The notice shall be delivered to the registered owner of the vehicle, by mail, within 30 days after the Secretary of State notifies the municipality or county of the identity of the owner of the vehicle, but in no event later than 90 days after the violation.
    The notice shall include:
        (1) the name and address of the registered owner of
    	
the vehicle;
        (2) the registration number of the motor vehicle
    	
involved in the violation;
        (3) the violation charged;
        (4) the location where the violation occurred;
        (5) the date and time of the violation;
        (6) a copy of the recorded images;
        (7) the amount of the civil penalty imposed and the
    	
requirements of any traffic education program imposed and the date by which the civil penalty should be paid and the traffic education program should be completed;
        (8) a statement that recorded images are evidence of
    	
a violation of a red light signal;
        (9) a warning that failure to pay the civil penalty,
    	
to complete a required traffic education program, or to contest liability in a timely manner is an admission of liability and may result in a suspension of the driving privileges of the registered owner of the vehicle;
        (10) a statement that the person may elect to proceed
    	
by:
            (A) paying the fine, completing a required
        	
traffic education program, or both; or
            (B) challenging the charge in court, by mail, or
        	
by administrative hearing; and
        (11) a website address, accessible through the
    	
Internet, where the person may view the recorded images of the violation.
    (e) If a person charged with a traffic violation, as a result of an automated traffic law enforcement system, does not pay the fine or complete a required traffic education program, or both, or successfully contest the civil penalty resulting from that violation, the Secretary of State shall suspend the driving privileges of the registered owner of the vehicle under Section 6-306.5 of this Code for failing to complete a required traffic education program or to pay any fine or penalty due and owing, or both, as a result of a combination of 5 violations of the automated traffic law enforcement system or the automated speed enforcement system under Section 11-208.8 of this Code.
    (f) Based on inspection of recorded images produced by an automated traffic law enforcement system, a notice alleging that the violation occurred shall be evidence of the facts contained in the notice and admissible in any proceeding alleging a violation under this Section.
    (g) Recorded images made by an automatic traffic law enforcement system are confidential and shall be made available only to the alleged violator and governmental and law enforcement agencies for purposes of adjudicating a violation of this Section, for statistical purposes, or for other governmental purposes. Any recorded image evidencing a violation of this Section, however, may be admissible in any proceeding resulting from the issuance of the citation.
    (h) The court or hearing officer may consider in defense of a violation:
        (1) that the motor vehicle or registration plates or
    	
digital registration plates of the motor vehicle were stolen before the violation occurred and not under the control of or in the possession of the owner at the time of the violation;
        (2) that the driver of the vehicle passed through the
    	
intersection when the light was red either (i) in order to yield the right-of-way to an emergency vehicle or (ii) as part of a funeral procession; and
        (3) any other evidence or issues provided by
    	
municipal or county ordinance.
    (i) To demonstrate that the motor vehicle or the registration plates or digital registration plates were stolen before the violation occurred and were not under the control or possession of the owner at the time of the violation, the owner must submit proof that a report concerning the stolen motor vehicle or registration plates was filed with a law enforcement agency in a timely manner.
    (j) Unless the driver of the motor vehicle received a Uniform Traffic Citation from a police officer at the time of the violation, the motor vehicle owner is subject to a civil penalty not exceeding $100 or the completion of a traffic education program, or both, plus an additional penalty of not more than $100 for failure to pay the original penalty or to complete a required traffic education program, or both, in a timely manner, if the motor vehicle is recorded by an automated traffic law enforcement system. A violation for which a civil penalty is imposed under this Section is not a violation of a traffic regulation governing the movement of vehicles and may not be recorded on the driving record of the owner of the vehicle.
    (j-3) A registered owner who is a holder of a valid commercial driver's license is not required to complete a traffic education program.
    (j-5) For purposes of the required traffic education program only, a registered owner may submit an affidavit to the court or hearing officer swearing that at the time of the alleged violation, the vehicle was in the custody and control of another person. The affidavit must identify the person in custody and control of the vehicle, including the person's name and current address. The person in custody and control of the vehicle at the time of the violation is required to complete the required traffic education program. If the person in custody and control of the vehicle at the time of the violation completes the required traffic education program, the registered owner of the vehicle is not required to complete a traffic education program.
    (k) An intersection equipped with an automated traffic law enforcement system must be posted with a sign visible to approaching traffic indicating that the intersection is being monitored by an automated traffic law enforcement system.
    (k-3) A municipality or county that has one or more intersections equipped with an automated traffic law enforcement system must provide notice to drivers by posting the locations of automated traffic law systems on the municipality or county website.
    (k-5) An intersection equipped with an automated traffic law enforcement system must have a yellow change interval that conforms with the Illinois Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (IMUTCD) published by the Illinois Department of Transportation.
    (k-7) A municipality or county operating an automated traffic law enforcement system shall conduct a statistical analysis to assess the safety impact of each automated traffic law enforcement system at an intersection following installation of the system. The statistical analysis shall be based upon the best available crash, traffic, and other data, and shall cover a period of time before and after installation of the system sufficient to provide a statistically valid comparison of safety impact. The statistical analysis shall be consistent with professional judgment and acceptable industry practice. The statistical analysis also shall be consistent with the data required for valid comparisons of before and after conditions and shall be conducted within a reasonable period following the installation of the automated traffic law enforcement system. The statistical analysis required by this subsection (k-7) shall be made available to the public and shall be published on the website of the municipality or county. If the statistical analysis for the 36 month period following installation of the system indicates that there has been an increase in the rate of accidents at the approach to the intersection monitored by the system, the municipality or county shall undertake additional studies to determine the cause and severity of the accidents, and may take any action that it determines is necessary or appropriate to reduce the number or severity of the accidents at that intersection.
    (l) The compensation paid for an automated traffic law enforcement system must be based on the value of the equipment or the services provided and may not be based on the number of traffic citations issued or the revenue generated by the system.
    (m) This Section applies only to the counties of Cook, DuPage, Kane, Lake, Madison, McHenry, St. Clair, and Will and to municipalities located within those counties.
    (n) The fee for participating in a traffic education program under this Section shall not exceed $25.
    A low-income individual required to complete a traffic education program under this Section who provides proof of eligibility for the federal earned income tax credit under Section 32 of the Internal Revenue Code or the Illinois earned income tax credit under Section 212 of the Illinois Income Tax Act shall not be required to pay any fee for participating in a required traffic education program.
    (o) A municipality or county shall make a certified report to the Secretary of State pursuant to Section 6-306.5 of this Code whenever a registered owner of a vehicle has failed to pay any fine or penalty due and owing as a result of a combination of 5 offenses for automated traffic law or speed enforcement system violations.
    (p) No person who is the lessor of a motor vehicle pursuant to a written lease agreement shall be liable for an automated speed or traffic law enforcement system violation involving such motor vehicle during the period of the lease; provided that upon the request of the appropriate authority received within 120 days after the violation occurred, the lessor provides within 60 days after such receipt the name and address of the lessee. The drivers license number of a lessee may be subsequently individually requested by the appropriate authority if needed for enforcement of this Section.
    Upon the provision of information by the lessor pursuant to this subsection, the county or municipality may issue the violation to the lessee of the vehicle in the same manner as it would issue a violation to a registered owner of a vehicle pursuant to this Section, and the lessee may be held liable for the violation.

    (Text of Section before amendment by P.A. 101-652)
    Sec. 11-208.8. Automated speed enforcement systems in safety zones.
    (a) As used in this Section:
    "Automated speed enforcement system" means a photographic device, radar device, laser device, or other electrical or mechanical device or devices installed or utilized in a safety zone and designed to record the speed of a vehicle and obtain a clear photograph or other recorded image of the vehicle and the vehicle's registration plate or digital registration plate while the driver is violating Article VI of Chapter 11 of this Code or a similar provision of a local ordinance.
    An automated speed enforcement system is a system, located in a safety zone which is under the jurisdiction of a municipality, that produces a recorded image of a motor vehicle's violation of a provision of this Code or a local ordinance and is designed to obtain a clear recorded image of the vehicle and the vehicle's license plate. The recorded image must also display the time, date, and location of the violation.
    "Owner" means the person or entity to whom the vehicle is registered.
    "Recorded image" means images recorded by an automated speed enforcement system on:
        (1) 2 or more photographs;
        (2) 2 or more microphotographs;
        (3) 2 or more electronic images; or
        (4) a video recording showing the motor vehicle and,
    	
on at least one image or portion of the recording, clearly identifying the registration plate or digital registration plate number of the motor vehicle.
    "Safety zone" means an area that is within one-eighth of a mile from the nearest property line of any public or private elementary or secondary school, or from the nearest property line of any facility, area, or land owned by a school district that is used for educational purposes approved by the Illinois State Board of Education, not including school district headquarters or administrative buildings. A safety zone also includes an area that is within one-eighth of a mile from the nearest property line of any facility, area, or land owned by a park district used for recreational purposes. However, if any portion of a roadway is within either one-eighth mile radius, the safety zone also shall include the roadway extended to the furthest portion of the next furthest intersection. The term "safety zone" does not include any portion of the roadway known as Lake Shore Drive or any controlled access highway with 8 or more lanes of traffic.
    (a-5) The automated speed enforcement system shall be operational and violations shall be recorded only at the following times:
        (i) if the safety zone is based upon the property
    	
line of any facility, area, or land owned by a school district, only on school days and no earlier than 6 a.m. and no later than 8:30 p.m. if the school day is during the period of Monday through Thursday, or 9 p.m. if the school day is a Friday; and
        (ii) if the safety zone is based upon the property
    	
line of any facility, area, or land owned by a park district, no earlier than one hour prior to the time that the facility, area, or land is open to the public or other patrons, and no later than one hour after the facility, area, or land is closed to the public or other patrons.
    (b) A municipality that produces a recorded image of a motor vehicle's violation of a provision of this Code or a local ordinance must make the recorded images of a violation accessible to the alleged violator by providing the alleged violator with a website address, accessible through the Internet.
    (c) Notwithstanding any penalties for any other violations of this Code, the owner of a motor vehicle used in a traffic violation recorded by an automated speed enforcement system shall be subject to the following penalties:
        (1) if the recorded speed is no less than 6 miles per
    	
hour and no more than 10 miles per hour over the legal speed limit, a civil penalty not exceeding $50, plus an additional penalty of not more than $50 for failure to pay the original penalty in a timely manner; or
        (2) if the recorded speed is more than 10 miles per
    	
hour over the legal speed limit, a civil penalty not exceeding $100, plus an additional penalty of not more than $100 for failure to pay the original penalty in a timely manner.
    A penalty may not be imposed under this Section if the driver of the motor vehicle received a Uniform Traffic Citation from a police officer for a speeding violation occurring within one-eighth of a mile and 15 minutes of the violation that was recorded by the system. A violation for which a civil penalty is imposed under this Section is not a violation of a traffic regulation governing the movement of vehicles and may not be recorded on the driving record of the owner of the vehicle. A law enforcement officer is not required to be present or to witness the violation. No penalty may be imposed under this Section if the recorded speed of a vehicle is 5 miles per hour or less over the legal speed limit. The municipality may send, in the same manner that notices are sent under this Section, a speed violation warning notice where the violation involves a speed of 5 miles per hour or less above the legal speed limit.
    (d) The net proceeds that a municipality receives from civil penalties imposed under an automated speed enforcement system, after deducting all non-personnel and personnel costs associated with the operation and maintenance of such system, shall be expended or obligated by the municipality for the following purposes:
        (i) public safety initiatives to ensure safe
    	
passage around schools, and to provide police protection and surveillance around schools and parks, including but not limited to: (1) personnel costs; and (2) non-personnel costs such as construction and maintenance of public safety infrastructure and equipment;
        (ii) initiatives to improve pedestrian and traffic
    	
safety;
        (iii) construction and maintenance of
    	
infrastructure within the municipality, including but not limited to roads and bridges; and
        (iv) after school programs.
    (e) For each violation of a provision of this Code or a local ordinance recorded by an automated speed enforcement system, the municipality having jurisdiction shall issue a written notice of the violation to the registered owner of the vehicle as the alleged violator. The notice shall be delivered to the registered owner of the vehicle, by mail, within 30 days after the Secretary of State notifies the municipality of the identity of the owner of the vehicle, but in no event later than 90 days after the violation.
    (f) The notice required under subsection (e) of this Section shall include:
        (1) the name and address of the registered owner of
    	
the vehicle;
        (2) the registration number of the motor vehicle
    	
involved in the violation;
        (3) the violation charged;
        (4) the date, time, and location where the violation
    	
occurred;
        (5) a copy of the recorded image or images;
        (6) the amount of the civil penalty imposed and the
    	
date by which the civil penalty should be paid;
        (7) a statement that recorded images are evidence of
    	
a violation of a speed restriction;
        (8) a warning that failure to pay the civil penalty
    	
or to contest liability in a timely manner is an admission of liability and may result in a suspension of the driving privileges of the registered owner of the vehicle;
        (9) a statement that the person may elect to proceed
    	
by:
            (A) paying the fine; or
            (B) challenging the charge in court, by mail, or
        	
by administrative hearing; and
        (10) a website address, accessible through the
    	
Internet, where the person may view the recorded images of the violation.
    (g) If a person charged with a traffic violation, as a result of an automated speed enforcement system, does not pay the fine or successfully contest the civil penalty resulting from that violation, the Secretary of State shall suspend the driving privileges of the registered owner of the vehicle under Section 6-306.5 of this Code for failing to pay any fine or penalty due and owing, or both, as a result of a combination of 5 violations of the automated speed enforcement system or the automated traffic law under Section 11-208.6 of this Code.
    (h) Based on inspection of recorded images produced by an automated speed enforcement system, a notice alleging that the violation occurred shall be evidence of the facts contained in the notice and admissible in any proceeding alleging a violation under this Section.
    (i) Recorded images made by an automated speed enforcement system are confidential and shall be made available only to the alleged violator and governmental and law enforcement agencies for purposes of adjudicating a violation of this Section, for statistical purposes, or for other governmental purposes. Any recorded image evidencing a violation of this Section, however, may be admissible in any proceeding resulting from the issuance of the citation.
    (j) The court or hearing officer may consider in defense of a violation:
        (1) that the motor vehicle or registration plates or
    	
digital registration plates of the motor vehicle were stolen before the violation occurred and not under the control or in the possession of the owner at the time of the violation;
        (2) that the driver of the motor vehicle received a
    	
Uniform Traffic Citation from a police officer for a speeding violation occurring within one-eighth of a mile and 15 minutes of the violation that was recorded by the system; and
        (3) any other evidence or issues provided by
    	
municipal ordinance.
    (k) To demonstrate that the motor vehicle or the registration plates or digital registration plates were stolen before the violation occurred and were not under the control or possession of the owner at the time of the violation, the owner must submit proof that a report concerning the stolen motor vehicle or registration plates was filed with a law enforcement agency in a timely manner.
    (l) A roadway equipped with an automated speed enforcement system shall be posted with a sign conforming to the national Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices that is visible to approaching traffic stating that vehicle speeds are being photo-enforced and indicating the speed limit. The municipality shall install such additional signage as it determines is necessary to give reasonable notice to drivers as to where automated speed enforcement systems are installed.
    (m) A roadway where a new automated speed enforcement system is installed shall be posted with signs providing 30 days notice of the use of a new automated speed enforcement system prior to the issuance of any citations through the automated speed enforcement system.
    (n) The compensation paid for an automated speed enforcement system must be based on the value of the equipment or the services provided and may not be based on the number of traffic citations issued or the revenue generated by the system.
    (o) A municipality shall make a certified report to the Secretary of State pursuant to Section 6-306.5 of this Code whenever a registered owner of a vehicle has failed to pay any fine or penalty due and owing as a result of a combination of 5 offenses for automated speed or traffic law enforcement system violations.
    (p) No person who is the lessor of a motor vehicle pursuant to a written lease agreement shall be liable for an automated speed or traffic law enforcement system violation involving such motor vehicle during the period of the lease; provided that upon the request of the appropriate authority received within 120 days after the violation occurred, the lessor provides within 60 days after such receipt the name and address of the lessee. The drivers license number of a lessee may be subsequently individually requested by the appropriate authority if needed for enforcement of this Section.
    Upon the provision of information by the lessor pursuant to this subsection, the municipality may issue the violation to the lessee of the vehicle in the same manner as it would issue a violation to a registered owner of a vehicle pursuant to this Section, and the lessee may be held liable for the violation.
    (q) A municipality using an automated speed enforcement system must provide notice to drivers by publishing the locations of all safety zones where system equipment is installed on the website of the municipality.
    (r) A municipality operating an automated speed enforcement system shall conduct a statistical analysis to assess the safety impact of the system. The statistical analysis shall be based upon the best available crash, traffic, and other data, and shall cover a period of time before and after installation of the system sufficient to provide a statistically valid comparison of safety impact. The statistical analysis shall be consistent with professional judgment and acceptable industry practice. The statistical analysis also shall be consistent with the data required for valid comparisons of before and after conditions and shall be conducted within a reasonable period following the installation of the automated traffic law enforcement system. The statistical analysis required by this subsection shall be made available to the public and shall be published on the website of the municipality.
    (s) This Section applies only to municipalities with a population of 1,000,000 or more inhabitants.

    (e) The notice required under subsection (d) shall include:
        (1) the name and address of the registered owner of
    	
the vehicle;
        (2) the registration number of the motor vehicle
    	
involved in the violation;
        (3) the violation charged;
        (4) the location where the violation occurred;

        (6) a copy of the recorded images;
        (7) the amount of the civil penalty imposed and the
    	
date by which the civil penalty should be paid;
        (8) a statement that recorded images are evidence of
    	
a violation of overtaking or passing a school bus stopped for the purpose of receiving or discharging pupils;
        (9) a warning that failure to pay the civil penalty
    	
or to contest liability in a timely manner is an admission of liability and may result in a suspension of the driving privileges of the registered owner of the vehicle;
        (10) a statement that the person may elect to proceed
    	
by:
            (A) paying the fine; or

    (g) Based on inspection of recorded images produced by an automated traffic law enforcement system, a notice alleging that the violation occurred shall be evidence of the facts contained in the notice and admissible in any proceeding alleging a violation under this Section.
    (h) Recorded images made by an automated traffic law enforcement system are confidential and shall be made available only to the alleged violator and governmental and law enforcement agencies for purposes of adjudicating a violation of this Section, for statistical purposes, or for other governmental purposes. Any recorded image evidencing a violation of this Section, however, may be admissible in any proceeding resulting from the issuance of the citation.
    (i) The court or hearing officer may consider in defense of a violation:
        (1) that the motor vehicle or registration plates or
    	
digital registration plates of the motor vehicle were stolen before the violation occurred and not under the control of or in the possession of the owner at the time of the violation;
        (2) that the driver of the motor vehicle received a
    	
Uniform Traffic Citation from a police officer for a violation of Section 11-1414 of this Code within one-eighth of a mile and 15 minutes of the violation that was recorded by the system;
        (3) that the visual signals required by Sections

        (4) any other evidence or issues provided by
    	
municipal or county ordinance.
    (j) To demonstrate that the motor vehicle or the registration plates or digital registration plates were stolen before the violation occurred and were not under the control or possession of the owner at the time of the violation, the owner must submit proof that a report concerning the stolen motor vehicle or registration plates was filed with a law enforcement agency in a timely manner.
    (k) Unless the driver of the motor vehicle received a Uniform Traffic Citation from a police officer at the time of the violation, the motor vehicle owner is subject to a civil penalty not exceeding $150 for a first time violation or $500 for a second or subsequent violation, plus an additional penalty of not more than $100 for failure to pay the original penalty in a timely manner, if the motor vehicle is recorded by an automated traffic law enforcement system. A violation for which a civil penalty is imposed under this Section is not a violation of a traffic regulation governing the movement of vehicles and may not be recorded on the driving record of the owner of the vehicle, but may be recorded by the municipality or county for the purpose of determining if a person is subject to the higher fine for a second or subsequent offense.
    (l) A school bus equipped with an automated traffic law enforcement system must be posted with a sign indicating that the school bus is being monitored by an automated traffic law enforcement system.
    (m) A municipality or county that has one or more school buses equipped with an automated traffic law enforcement system must provide notice to drivers by posting a list of school districts using school buses equipped with an automated traffic law enforcement system on the municipality or county website. School districts that have one or more school buses equipped with an automated traffic law enforcement system must provide notice to drivers by posting that information on their websites.
    (n) A municipality or county operating an automated traffic law enforcement system shall conduct a statistical analysis to assess the safety impact in each school district using school buses equipped with an automated traffic law enforcement system following installation of the system. The statistical analysis shall be based upon the best available crash, traffic, and other data, and shall cover a period of time before and after installation of the system sufficient to provide a statistically valid comparison of safety impact. The statistical analysis shall be consistent with professional judgment and acceptable industry practice. The statistical analysis also shall be consistent with the data required for valid comparisons of before and after conditions and shall be conducted within a reasonable period following the installation of the automated traffic law enforcement system. The statistical analysis required by this subsection shall be made available to the public and shall be published on the website of the municipality or county. If the statistical analysis for the 36-month period following installation of the system indicates that there has been an increase in the rate of accidents at the approach to school buses monitored by the system, the municipality or county shall undertake additional studies to determine the cause and severity of the accidents, and may take any action that it determines is necessary or appropriate to reduce the number or severity of the accidents involving school buses equipped with an automated traffic law enforcement system.
    (o) The compensation paid for an automated traffic law enforcement system must be based on the value of the equipment or the services provided and may not be based on the number of traffic citations issued or the revenue generated by the system.
    (p) No person who is the lessor of a motor vehicle pursuant to a written lease agreement shall be liable for an automated speed or traffic law enforcement system violation involving such motor vehicle during the period of the lease; provided that upon the request of the appropriate authority received within 120 days after the violation occurred, the lessor provides within 60 days after such receipt the name and address of the lessee. The drivers license number of a lessee may be subsequently individually requested by the appropriate authority if needed for enforcement of this Section.
    Upon the provision of information by the lessor pursuant to this subsection, the county or municipality may issue the violation to the lessee of the vehicle in the same manner as it would issue a violation to a registered owner of a vehicle pursuant to this Section, and the lessee may be held liable for the violation.
    (q) A municipality or county shall make a certified report to the Secretary of State pursuant to Section 6-306.5 of this Code whenever a registered owner of a vehicle has failed to pay any fine or penalty due and owing as a result of a combination of 5 offenses for automated traffic law or speed enforcement system violations.
    (r) After a municipality or county enacts an ordinance providing for automated traffic law enforcement systems under this Section, each school district within that municipality or county's jurisdiction may implement an automated traffic law enforcement system under this Section. The elected school board for that district must approve the implementation of an automated traffic law enforcement system. The school district shall be responsible for entering into a contract, approved by the elected school board of that district, with vendors for the installation, maintenance, and operation of the automated traffic law enforcement system. The school district must enter into an intergovernmental agreement, approved by the elected school board of that district, with the municipality or county with jurisdiction over that school district for the administration of the automated traffic law enforcement system. The proceeds from a school district's automated traffic law enforcement system's fines shall be divided equally between the school district and the municipality or county administering the automated traffic law enforcement system.

    (h) Recorded images made by an automated traffic law enforcement system are confidential and shall be made available only to the alleged violator and governmental and law enforcement agencies for purposes of adjudicating a violation of this Section, for statistical purposes, or for other governmental purposes. Any recorded image evidencing a violation of this Section, however, may be admissible in any proceeding resulting from the issuance of the citation.

(a) Any person or board of directors owning, operating or representing a residential subdivision, development, apartment house or apartment project; containing a minimum of 10 apartments or single family residences may file a written request, with the appropriate local authority wherein such property is situated, requesting their law enforcement agency enforce the provisions of this Code on all private streets or roads open to or used by the tenants, owners, employees or the public for the purposes of vehicular traffic by permission of such person or board of directors and not as a matter of public right. Notwithstanding Section 1-126 and Section 1-201 of this Code, if the local authority grants such request by the adoption of an enabling ordinance then all such private streets or roads shall be considered "highways" only for the enforcement purposes of this Code.
    (b) All regulations adopted and traffic control devices employed by a local authority in the enforcement of this Code on such streets or roads within any private area, pursuant to this Section, shall be consistent with the provisions of this Code and shall conform to the Illinois Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices.

    (625 ILCS 5/11-306) (from Ch. 95 1/2, par. 11-306)
    Sec. 11-306. Traffic-control signal legend. Whenever traffic is controlled by traffic-control signals exhibiting different colored lights or color lighted arrows, successively one at a time or in combination, only the colors green, red and yellow shall be used, except for special pedestrian signals carrying a word legend, and the lights shall indicate and apply to drivers of vehicles and pedestrians as follows:
    (a) Green indication.
        1. Vehicular traffic facing a circular green signal
    	
may proceed straight through or turn right or left unless a sign at such place prohibits either such turn. Vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left, shall yield the right of way to other vehicles and to pedestrians lawfully within the intersection or an adjacent crosswalk at the time such signal is exhibited.
        2. Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal,
    	
shown alone or in combination with another indication, may cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by such arrow, or such other movement as is permitted by other indications shown at the same time. Such vehicular traffic shall yield the right of way to pedestrians lawfully within an adjacent crosswalk and to other traffic lawfully using the intersection.
        3. Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian-control
    	
signal, as provided in Section 11-307, pedestrians facing any green signal, except when the sole green signal is a turn arrow, may proceed across the roadway within any marked or unmarked crosswalk.
    (b) Steady yellow indication.
        1. Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular yellow
    	
or yellow arrow signal is thereby warned that the related green movement is being terminated or that a red indication will be exhibited immediately thereafter.
        2. Pedestrians facing a steady circular yellow or
    	
yellow arrow signal, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian-control signal as provided in Section 11-307, are thereby advised that there is insufficient time to cross the roadway before a red indication is shown and no pedestrian shall then start to cross the roadway.
    (b-5) Flashing yellow arrow indication.
        1. Vehicular traffic facing a flashing yellow arrow
    	
indication may cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by the arrow and shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles and pedestrians lawfully within the intersection or an adjacent crosswalk at the time the signal is exhibited.
        2. Pedestrians facing a flashing yellow arrow
    	
indication, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian-control signal as provided in Section 11-307, may proceed across the roadway within any marked or unmarked crosswalk that crosses the lane or lanes used to depart the intersection by traffic controlled by the flashing yellow arrow indication. Pedestrians shall yield the right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the flashing yellow signal indication is first displayed.
    (c) Steady red indication.
        1. Except as provided in paragraphs 3 and 3.5 of this
    	
subsection (c), vehicular traffic facing a steady circular red signal alone shall stop at a clearly marked stop line, but if there is no such stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the intersection, or if there is no such crosswalk, then before entering the intersection, and shall remain standing until an indication to proceed is shown.
        2. Except as provided in paragraphs 3 and 3.5 of this
    	
subsection (c), vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow signal shall not enter the intersection to make the movement indicated by the arrow and, unless entering the intersection to make a movement permitted by another signal, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line, but if there is no such stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the intersection, or if there is no such crosswalk, then before entering the intersection, and shall remain standing until an indication permitting the movement indicated by such red arrow is shown.
        3. Except when a sign is in place prohibiting a turn
    	
and local authorities by ordinance or State authorities by rule or regulation prohibit any such turn, vehicular traffic facing any steady red signal may cautiously enter the intersection to turn right, or to turn left from a one-way street into a one-way street, after stopping as required by paragraph 1 or paragraph 2 of this subsection. After stopping, the driver shall yield the right of way to any vehicle in the intersection or approaching on another roadway so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the time such driver is moving across or within the intersection or junction or roadways. Such driver shall yield the right of way to pedestrians within the intersection or an adjacent crosswalk.
        3.5. In municipalities with less than 2,000,000
    	
inhabitants, after stopping as required by paragraph 1 or 2 of this subsection, the driver of a motorcycle or bicycle, facing a steady red signal which fails to change to a green signal within a reasonable period of time not less than 120 seconds because of a signal malfunction or because the signal has failed to detect the arrival of the motorcycle or bicycle due to the vehicle's size or weight, shall have the right to proceed, after yielding the right of way to oncoming traffic facing a green signal, subject to the rules applicable after making a stop at a stop sign as required by Section 11-1204 of this Code.
        4. Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian-control
    	
signal as provided in Section 11-307, pedestrians facing a steady circular red or red arrow signal alone shall not enter the roadway.
    (d) In the event an official traffic control signal is erected and maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions of this Section shall be applicable except as to provisions which by their nature can have no application. Any stop required shall be at a traffic sign or a marking on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made or, in the absence of such sign or marking, the stop shall be made at the signal.

The issuance of the Uniform Traffic Ticket shall not constitute an arrest, but shall be for the purpose of notifying the person that he or she is subject to the provisions of this Section and of the officer's belief of the existence of probable cause to arrest. Upon returning to this State, the officer shall file the Uniform Traffic Ticket with the Circuit Clerk of the county where the offense was committed, and shall seek the issuance of an arrest warrant or a summons for the person.

    Sec. 11-501.2. Chemical and other tests.
    (a) Upon the trial of any civil or criminal action or proceeding arising out of an arrest for an offense as defined in Section 11-501 or a similar local ordinance or proceedings pursuant to Section 2-118.1, evidence of the concentration of alcohol, other drug or drugs, or intoxicating compound or compounds, or any combination thereof in a person's blood or breath at the time alleged, as determined by analysis of the person's blood, urine, breath, or other bodily substance, shall be admissible. Where such test is made the following provisions shall apply:
        1. Chemical analyses of the person's blood, urine,
    	
breath, or other bodily substance to be considered valid under the provisions of this Section shall have been performed according to standards promulgated by the Department of State Police by a licensed physician, registered nurse, trained phlebotomist, licensed paramedic, or other individual possessing a valid permit issued by that Department for this purpose. The Director of State Police is authorized to approve satisfactory techniques or methods, to ascertain the qualifications and competence of individuals to conduct such analyses, to issue permits which shall be subject to termination or revocation at the discretion of that Department and to certify the accuracy of breath testing equipment. The Department of State Police shall prescribe regulations as necessary to implement this Section.
        2. When a person in this State shall submit to a
    	
blood test at the request of a law enforcement officer under the provisions of Section 11-501.1, only a physician authorized to practice medicine, a licensed physician assistant, a licensed advanced practice registered nurse, a registered nurse, trained phlebotomist, or licensed paramedic, or other qualified person approved by the Department of State Police may withdraw blood for the purpose of determining the alcohol, drug, or alcohol and drug content therein. This limitation shall not apply to the taking of breath, other bodily substance, or urine specimens.
        When a blood test of a person who has been taken to
    	
an adjoining state for medical treatment is requested by an Illinois law enforcement officer, the blood may be withdrawn only by a physician authorized to practice medicine in the adjoining state, a licensed physician assistant, a licensed advanced practice registered nurse, a registered nurse, a trained phlebotomist acting under the direction of the physician, or licensed paramedic. The law enforcement officer requesting the test shall take custody of the blood sample, and the blood sample shall be analyzed by a laboratory certified by the Department of State Police for that purpose.
        3. The person tested may have a physician, or a
    	
qualified technician, chemist, registered nurse, or other qualified person of their own choosing administer a chemical test or tests in addition to any administered at the direction of a law enforcement officer. The failure or inability to obtain an additional test by a person shall not preclude the admission of evidence relating to the test or tests taken at the direction of a law enforcement officer.
        4. Upon the request of the person who shall submit to
    	
a chemical test or tests at the request of a law enforcement officer, full information concerning the test or tests shall be made available to the person or such person's attorney.
        5. Alcohol concentration shall mean either grams of
    	
alcohol per 100 milliliters of blood or grams of alcohol per 210 liters of breath.
        6. Tetrahydrocannabinol concentration means either 5
    	
nanograms or more of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol per milliliter of whole blood or 10 nanograms or more of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol per milliliter of other bodily substance.
    (a-5) Law enforcement officials may use validated roadside chemical tests or standardized field sobriety tests approved by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration when conducting investigations of a violation of Section 11-501 or similar local ordinance by drivers suspected of driving under the influence of cannabis. The General Assembly finds that (i) validated roadside chemical tests are effective means to determine if a person is under the influence of cannabis and (ii) standardized field sobriety tests approved by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration are divided attention tasks that are intended to determine if a person is under the influence of cannabis. The purpose of these tests is to determine the effect of the use of cannabis on a person's capacity to think and act with ordinary care and therefore operate a motor vehicle safely. Therefore, the results of these validated roadside chemical tests and standardized field sobriety tests, appropriately administered, shall be admissible in the trial of any civil or criminal action or proceeding arising out of an arrest for a cannabis-related offense as defined in Section 11-501 or a similar local ordinance or proceedings under Section 2-118.1 or 2-118.2. Where a test is made the following provisions shall apply:
        1. The person tested may have a physician, or a
    	
qualified technician, chemist, registered nurse, or other qualified person of their own choosing administer a chemical test or tests in addition to the standardized field sobriety test or tests administered at the direction of a law enforcement officer. The failure or inability to obtain an additional test by a person does not preclude the admission of evidence relating to the test or tests taken at the direction of a law enforcement officer.
        2. Upon the request of the person who shall submit to
    	
validated roadside chemical tests or a standardized field sobriety test or tests at the request of a law enforcement officer, full information concerning the test or tests shall be made available to the person or the person's attorney.
        3. At the trial of any civil or criminal action or
    	
proceeding arising out of an arrest for an offense as defined in Section 11-501 or a similar local ordinance or proceedings under Section 2-118.1 or 2-118.2 in which the results of these validated roadside chemical tests or standardized field sobriety tests are admitted, the person may present and the trier of fact may consider evidence that the person lacked the physical capacity to perform the validated roadside chemical tests or standardized field sobriety tests.
    (b) Upon the trial of any civil or criminal action or proceeding arising out of acts alleged to have been committed by any person while driving or in actual physical control of a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol, the concentration of alcohol in the person's blood or breath at the time alleged as shown by analysis of the person's blood, urine, breath, or other bodily substance shall give rise to the following presumptions:
        1. If there was at that time an alcohol concentration
    	
of 0.05 or less, it shall be presumed that the person was not under the influence of alcohol.
        2. If there was at that time an alcohol concentration
    	
in excess of 0.05 but less than 0.08, such facts shall not give rise to any presumption that the person was or was not under the influence of alcohol, but such fact may be considered with other competent evidence in determining whether the person was under the influence of alcohol.
        3. If there was at that time an alcohol concentration
    	
of 0.08 or more, it shall be presumed that the person was under the influence of alcohol.
        4. The foregoing provisions of this Section shall not
    	
be construed as limiting the introduction of any other relevant evidence bearing upon the question whether the person was under the influence of alcohol.
    (b-5) Upon the trial of any civil or criminal action or proceeding arising out of acts alleged to have been committed by any person while driving or in actual physical control of a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol, other drug or drugs, intoxicating compound or compounds or any combination thereof, the concentration of cannabis in the person's whole blood or other bodily substance at the time alleged as shown by analysis of the person's blood or other bodily substance shall give rise to the following presumptions:
        1. If there was a tetrahydrocannabinol concentration
    	
of 5 nanograms or more in whole blood or 10 nanograms or more in an other bodily substance as defined in this Section, it shall be presumed that the person was under the influence of cannabis.
        2. If there was at that time a tetrahydrocannabinol
    	
concentration of less than 5 nanograms in whole blood or less than 10 nanograms in an other bodily substance, such facts shall not give rise to any presumption that the person was or was not under the influence of cannabis, but such fact may be considered with other competent evidence in determining whether the person was under the influence of cannabis.
    (c) 1. If a person under arrest refuses to submit to a chemical test under the provisions of Section 11-501.1, evidence of refusal shall be admissible in any civil or criminal action or proceeding arising out of acts alleged to have been committed while the person under the influence of alcohol, other drug or drugs, or intoxicating compound or compounds, or any combination thereof was driving or in actual physical control of a motor vehicle.
    2. Notwithstanding any ability to refuse under this Code to submit to these tests or any ability to revoke the implied consent to these tests, if a law enforcement officer has probable cause to believe that a motor vehicle driven by or in actual physical control of a person under the influence of alcohol, other drug or drugs, or intoxicating compound or compounds, or any combination thereof has caused the death or personal injury to another, the law enforcement officer shall request, and that person shall submit, upon the request of a law enforcement officer, to a chemical test or tests of his or her blood, breath, other bodily substance, or urine for the purpose of determining the alcohol content thereof or the presence of any other drug or combination of both.
    This provision does not affect the applicability of or imposition of driver's license sanctions under Section 11-501.1 of this Code.
    3. For purposes of this Section, a personal injury includes any Type A injury as indicated on the traffic accident report completed by a law enforcement officer that requires immediate professional attention in either a doctor's office or a medical facility. A Type A injury includes severe bleeding wounds, distorted extremities, and injuries that require the injured party to be carried from the scene.
    (d) If a person refuses validated roadside chemical tests or standardized field sobriety tests under Section 11-501.9 of this Code, evidence of refusal shall be admissible in any civil or criminal action or proceeding arising out of acts committed while the person was driving or in actual physical control of a vehicle and alleged to have been impaired by the use of cannabis.
    (e) Department of State Police compliance with the changes in this amendatory Act of the 99th General Assembly concerning testing of other bodily substances and tetrahydrocannabinol concentration by Department of State Police laboratories is subject to appropriation and until the Department of State Police adopt standards and completion validation. Any laboratories that test for the presence of cannabis or other drugs under this Article, the Snowmobile Registration and Safety Act, or the Boat Registration and Safety Act must comply with ISO/IEC 17025:2005.

    Sec. 11-501.5. Preliminary Breath Screening Test.
    (a) If a law enforcement officer has reasonable suspicion to believe that a person is violating or has violated Section 11-501 or a similar provision of a local ordinance, the officer, prior to an arrest, may request the person to provide a sample of his or her breath for a preliminary breath screening test using a portable device approved by the Department of State Police. The person may refuse the test. The results of this preliminary breath screening test may be used by the law enforcement officer for the purpose of assisting with the determination of whether to require a chemical test as authorized under Sections 11-501.1 and 11-501.2, and the appropriate type of test to request. Any chemical test authorized under Sections 11-501.1 and 11-501.2 may be requested by the officer regardless of the result of the preliminary breath screening test, if probable cause for an arrest exists. The result of a preliminary breath screening test may be used by the defendant as evidence in any administrative or court proceeding involving a violation of Section 11-501 or 11-501.1.
    (b) The Department of State Police shall create a pilot program to establish the effectiveness of pupillometer technology (the measurement of the pupil's reaction to light) as a noninvasive technique to detect and measure possible impairment of any person who drives or is in actual physical control of a motor vehicle resulting from the suspected usage of alcohol, other drug or drugs, intoxicating compound or compounds or any combination thereof. This technology shall also be used to detect fatigue levels of the operator of a Commercial Motor Vehicle as defined in Section 6-500(6), pursuant to Section 18b-105 (Part 395-Hours of Service of Drivers) of the Illinois Vehicle Code. A State Police officer may request that the operator of a commercial motor vehicle have his or her eyes examined or tested with a pupillometer device. The person may refuse the examination or test. The State Police officer shall have the device readily available to limit undue delays.
    If a State Police officer has reasonable suspicion to believe that a person is violating or has violated Section 11-501, the officer may use the pupillometer technology, when available. The officer, prior to an arrest, may request the person to have his or her eyes examined or tested with a pupillometer device. The person may refuse the examination or test. The results of this examination or test may be used by the officer for the purpose of assisting with the determination of whether to require a chemical test as authorized under Sections 11-501.1 and 11-501.2 and the appropriate type of test to request. Any chemical test authorized under Sections 11-501.1 and 11-501.2 may be requested by the officer regardless of the result of the pupillometer examination or test, if probable cause for an arrest exists. The result of the examination or test may be used by the defendant as evidence in any administrative or court proceeding involving a violation of 11-501 or 11-501.1.
    The pilot program shall last for a period of 18 months and involve the testing of 15 pupillometer devices. Within 90 days of the completion of the pilot project, the Department of State Police shall file a report with the President of the Senate and Speaker of the House evaluating the project.

    (a) Any person who drives or is in actual control of a motor vehicle upon the public highways of this State and who has been involved in a personal injury or fatal motor vehicle accident, shall be deemed to have given consent to a breath test using a portable device as approved by the Department of State Police or to a chemical test or tests of blood, breath, other bodily substance, or urine for the purpose of determining the content of alcohol, other drug or drugs, or intoxicating compound or compounds of such person's blood if arrested as evidenced by the issuance of a Uniform Traffic Ticket for any violation of the Illinois Vehicle Code or a similar provision of a local ordinance, with the exception of equipment violations contained in Chapter 12 of this Code, or similar provisions of local ordinances. The test or tests shall be administered at the direction of the arresting officer. The law enforcement agency employing the officer shall designate which of the aforesaid tests shall be administered. Up to 2 additional tests of urine or other bodily substance may be administered even after a blood or breath test or both has been administered. Compliance with this Section does not relieve such person from the requirements of Section 11-501.1 of this Code.
    (b) Any person who is dead, unconscious or who is otherwise in a condition rendering such person incapable of refusal shall be deemed not to have withdrawn the consent provided by subsection (a) of this Section. In addition, if a driver of a vehicle is receiving medical treatment as a result of a motor vehicle accident, any physician licensed to practice medicine, licensed physician assistant, licensed advanced practice registered nurse, registered nurse or a phlebotomist acting under the direction of a licensed physician shall withdraw blood for testing purposes to ascertain the presence of alcohol, other drug or drugs, or intoxicating compound or compounds, upon the specific request of a law enforcement officer. However, no such testing shall be performed until, in the opinion of the medical personnel on scene, the withdrawal can be made without interfering with or endangering the well-being of the patient.
    (c) A person requested to submit to a test as provided above shall be warned by the law enforcement officer requesting the test that a refusal to submit to the test, or submission to the test resulting in an alcohol concentration of 0.08 or more, or testing discloses the presence of cannabis as listed in the Cannabis Control Act with a tetrahydrocannabinol concentration as defined in paragraph 6 of subsection (a) of Section 11-501.2 of this Code, or any amount of a drug, substance, or intoxicating compound resulting from the unlawful use or consumption of a controlled substance listed in the Illinois Controlled Substances Act, an intoxicating compound listed in the Use of Intoxicating Compounds Act, or methamphetamine as listed in the Methamphetamine Control and Community Protection Act as detected in such person's blood, other bodily substance, or urine, may result in the suspension of such person's privilege to operate a motor vehicle. If the person is also a CDL holder, he or she shall be warned by the law enforcement officer requesting the test that a refusal to submit to the test, or submission to the test resulting in an alcohol concentration of 0.08 or more, or any amount of a drug, substance, or intoxicating compound resulting from the unlawful use or consumption of cannabis, as covered by the Cannabis Control Act, a controlled substance listed in the Illinois Controlled Substances Act, an intoxicating compound listed in the Use of Intoxicating Compounds Act, or methamphetamine as listed in the Methamphetamine Control and Community Protection Act as detected in the person's blood, other bodily substance, or urine, may result in the disqualification of the person's privilege to operate a commercial motor vehicle, as provided in Section 6-514 of this Code. The length of the suspension shall be the same as outlined in Section 6-208.1 of this Code regarding statutory summary suspensions.
    A person requested to submit to a test shall also acknowledge, in writing, receipt of the warning required under this Section. If the person refuses to acknowledge receipt of the warning, the law enforcement officer shall make a written notation on the warning that the person refused to sign the warning. A person's refusal to sign the warning shall not be evidence that the person was not read the warning.
    (d) If the person refuses testing or submits to a test which discloses an alcohol concentration of 0.08 or more, the presence of cannabis as listed in the Cannabis Control Act with a tetrahydrocannabinol concentration as defined in paragraph 6 of subsection (a) of Section 11-501.2 of this Code, or any amount of a drug, substance, or intoxicating compound in such person's blood or urine resulting from the unlawful use or consumption of a controlled substance listed in the Illinois Controlled Substances Act, an intoxicating compound listed in the Use of Intoxicating Compounds Act, or methamphetamine as listed in the Methamphetamine Control and Community Protection Act, the law enforcement officer shall immediately submit a sworn report to the Secretary of State on a form prescribed by the Secretary, certifying that the test or tests were requested under subsection (a) and the person refused to submit to a test or tests or submitted to testing which disclosed an alcohol concentration of 0.08 or more, the presence of cannabis as listed in the Cannabis Control Act with a tetrahydrocannabinol concentration as defined in paragraph 6 of subsection (a) of Section 11-501.2 of this Code, or any amount of a drug, substance, or intoxicating compound in such person's blood, other bodily substance, or urine, resulting from the unlawful use or consumption of a controlled substance listed in the Illinois Controlled Substances Act, an intoxicating compound listed in the Use of Intoxicating Compounds Act, or methamphetamine as listed in the Methamphetamine Control and Community Protection Act. If the person is also a CDL holder and refuses testing or submits to a test which discloses an alcohol concentration of 0.08 or more, or any amount of a drug, substance, or intoxicating compound in the person's blood, other bodily substance, or urine resulting from the unlawful use or consumption of cannabis listed in the Cannabis Control Act, a controlled substance listed in the Illinois Controlled Substances Act, an intoxicating compound listed in the Use of Intoxicating Compounds Act, or methamphetamine as listed in the Methamphetamine Control and Community Protection Act, the law enforcement officer shall immediately submit a sworn report to the Secretary of State on a form prescribed by the Secretary, certifying that the test or tests were requested under subsection (a) and the person refused to submit to a test or tests or submitted to testing which disclosed an alcohol concentration of 0.08 or more, or any amount of a drug, substance, or intoxicating compound in such person's blood, other bodily substance, or urine, resulting from the unlawful use or consumption of cannabis listed in the Cannabis Control Act, a controlled substance listed in the Illinois Controlled Substances Act, an intoxicating compound listed in the Use of Intoxicating Compounds Act, or methamphetamine as listed in the Methamphetamine Control and Community Protection Act.
    Upon receipt of the sworn report of a law enforcement officer, the Secretary shall enter the suspension and disqualification to the individual's driving record and the suspension and disqualification shall be effective on the 46th day following the date notice of the suspension was given to the person.
    The law enforcement officer submitting the sworn report shall serve immediate notice of this suspension on the person and such suspension and disqualification shall be effective on the 46th day following the date notice was given.
    In cases involving a person who is not a CDL holder where the blood alcohol concentration of 0.08 or more, or blood testing discloses the presence of cannabis as listed in the Cannabis Control Act with a tetrahydrocannabinol concentration as defined in paragraph 6 of subsection (a) of Section 11-501.2 of this Code, or any amount of a drug, substance, or intoxicating compound resulting from the unlawful use or consumption of a controlled substance listed in the Illinois Controlled Substances Act, an intoxicating compound listed in the Use of Intoxicating Compounds Act, or methamphetamine as listed in the Methamphetamine Control and Community Protection Act, is established by a subsequent analysis of blood, other bodily substance, or urine collected at the time of arrest, the arresting officer shall give notice as provided in this Section or by deposit in the United States mail of such notice in an envelope with postage prepaid and addressed to such person at his or her address as shown on the Uniform Traffic Ticket and the suspension shall be effective on the 46th day following the date notice was given.
    In cases involving a person who is a CDL holder where the blood alcohol concentration of 0.08 or more, or any amount of a drug, substance, or intoxicating compound resulting from the unlawful use or consumption of cannabis as listed in the Cannabis Control Act, a controlled substance listed in the Illinois Controlled Substances Act, an intoxicating compound listed in the Use of Intoxicating Compounds Act, or methamphetamine as listed in the Methamphetamine Control and Community Protection Act, is established by a subsequent analysis of blood, other bodily substance, or urine collected at the time of arrest, the arresting officer shall give notice as provided in this Section or by deposit in the United States mail of such notice in an envelope with postage prepaid and addressed to the person at his or her address as shown on the Uniform Traffic Ticket and the suspension and disqualification shall be effective on the 46th day following the date notice was given.
    Upon receipt of the sworn report of a law enforcement officer, the Secretary shall also give notice of the suspension and disqualification to the driver by mailing a notice of the effective date of the suspension and disqualification to the individual. However, should the sworn report be defective by not containing sufficient information or be completed in error, the notice of the suspension and disqualification shall not be mailed to the person or entered to the driving record, but rather the sworn report shall be returned to the issuing law enforcement agency.
    (e) A driver may contest this suspension of his or her driving privileges and disqualification of his or her CDL privileges by requesting an administrative hearing with the Secretary in accordance with Section 2-118 of this Code. At the conclusion of a hearing held under Section 2-118 of this Code, the Secretary may rescind, continue, or modify the orders of suspension and disqualification. If the Secretary does not rescind the orders of suspension and disqualification, a restricted driving permit may be granted by the Secretary upon application being made and good cause shown. A restricted driving permit may be granted to relieve undue hardship to allow driving for employment, educational, and medical purposes as outlined in Section 6-206 of this Code. The provisions of Section 6-206 of this Code shall apply. In accordance with 49 C.F.R. 384, the Secretary of State may not issue a restricted driving permit for the operation of a commercial motor vehicle to a person holding a CDL whose driving privileges have been suspended, revoked, cancelled, or disqualified.

    (625 ILCS 5/11-501.8)
    Sec. 11-501.8. Suspension of driver's license; persons under age 21.
    (a) A person who is less than 21 years of age and who drives or is in actual physical control of a motor vehicle upon the public highways of this State shall be deemed to have given consent to a chemical test or tests of blood, breath, other bodily substance, or urine for the purpose of determining the alcohol content of the person's blood if arrested, as evidenced by the issuance of a Uniform Traffic Ticket for any violation of the Illinois Vehicle Code or a similar provision of a local ordinance, if a police officer has probable cause to believe that the driver has consumed any amount of an alcoholic beverage based upon evidence of the driver's physical condition or other first hand knowledge of the police officer. The test or tests shall be administered at the direction of the arresting officer. The law enforcement agency employing the officer shall designate which of the aforesaid tests shall be administered. Up to 2 additional tests of urine or other bodily substance may be administered even after a blood or breath test or both has been administered.
    (b) A person who is dead, unconscious, or who is otherwise in a condition rendering that person incapable of refusal, shall be deemed not to have withdrawn the consent provided by paragraph (a) of this Section and the test or tests may be administered subject to the following provisions:
        (i) Chemical analysis of the person's blood, urine,
    	
breath, or other bodily substance, to be considered valid under the provisions of this Section, shall have been performed according to standards promulgated by the Department of State Police by an individual possessing a valid permit issued by that Department for this purpose. The Director of State Police is authorized to approve satisfactory techniques or methods, to ascertain the qualifications and competence of individuals to conduct analyses, to issue permits that shall be subject to termination or revocation at the direction of that Department, and to certify the accuracy of breath testing equipment. The Department of State Police shall prescribe regulations as necessary.
        (ii) When a person submits to a blood test at the
    	
request of a law enforcement officer under the provisions of this Section, only a physician authorized to practice medicine, a licensed physician assistant, a licensed advanced practice registered nurse, a registered nurse, or other qualified person trained in venipuncture and acting under the direction of a licensed physician may withdraw blood for the purpose of determining the alcohol content therein. This limitation does not apply to the taking of breath, other bodily substance, or urine specimens.
        (iii) The person tested may have a physician,
    	
qualified technician, chemist, registered nurse, or other qualified person of his or her own choosing administer a chemical test or tests in addition to any test or tests administered at the direction of a law enforcement officer. The failure or inability to obtain an additional test by a person shall not preclude the consideration of the previously performed chemical test.
        (iv) Upon a request of the person who submits to a
    	
chemical test or tests at the request of a law enforcement officer, full information concerning the test or tests shall be made available to the person or that person's attorney.
        (v) Alcohol concentration means either grams of
    	
alcohol per 100 milliliters of blood or grams of alcohol per 210 liters of breath.
        (vi) If a driver is receiving medical treatment as a
    	
result of a motor vehicle accident, a physician licensed to practice medicine, licensed physician assistant, licensed advanced practice registered nurse, registered nurse, or other qualified person trained in venipuncture and acting under the direction of a licensed physician shall withdraw blood for testing purposes to ascertain the presence of alcohol upon the specific request of a law enforcement officer. However, that testing shall not be performed until, in the opinion of the medical personnel on scene, the withdrawal can be made without interfering with or endangering the well-being of the patient.
    (c) A person requested to submit to a test as provided above shall be warned by the law enforcement officer requesting the test that a refusal to submit to the test, or submission to the test resulting in an alcohol concentration of more than 0.00, may result in the loss of that person's privilege to operate a motor vehicle and may result in the disqualification of the person's privilege to operate a commercial motor vehicle, as provided in Section 6-514 of this Code, if the person is a CDL holder. The loss of driving privileges shall be imposed in accordance with Section 6-208.2 of this Code.
    A person requested to submit to a test shall also acknowledge, in writing, receipt of the warning required under this Section. If the person refuses to acknowledge receipt of the warning, the law enforcement officer shall make a written notation on the warning that the person refused to sign the warning. A person's refusal to sign the warning shall not be evidence that the person was not read the warning.
    (d) If the person refuses testing or submits to a test that discloses an alcohol concentration of more than 0.00, the law enforcement officer shall immediately submit a sworn report to the Secretary of State on a form prescribed by the Secretary of State, certifying that the test or tests were requested under subsection (a) and the person refused to submit to a test or tests or submitted to testing which disclosed an alcohol concentration of more than 0.00. The law enforcement officer shall submit the same sworn report when a person under the age of 21 submits to testing under Section 11-501.1 of this Code and the testing discloses an alcohol concentration of more than 0.00 and less than 0.08.
    Upon receipt of the sworn report of a law enforcement officer, the Secretary of State shall enter the suspension and disqualification on the individual's driving record and the suspension and disqualification shall be effective on the 46th day following the date notice of the suspension was given to the person. If this suspension is the individual's first driver's license suspension under this Section, reports received by the Secretary of State under this Section shall, except during the time the suspension is in effect, be privileged information and for use only by the courts, police officers, prosecuting authorities, the Secretary of State, or the individual personally, unless the person is a CDL holder, is operating a commercial motor vehicle or vehicle required to be placarded for hazardous materials, in which case the suspension shall not be privileged. Reports received by the Secretary of State under this Section shall also be made available to the parent or guardian of a person under the age of 18 years that holds an instruction permit or a graduated driver's license, regardless of whether the suspension is in effect.
    The law enforcement officer submitting the sworn report shall serve immediate notice of this suspension on the person and the suspension and disqualification shall be effective on the 46th day following the date notice was given.
    In cases where the blood alcohol concentration of more than 0.00 is established by a subsequent analysis of blood, other bodily substance, or urine, the police officer or arresting agency shall give notice as provided in this Section or by deposit in the United States mail of that notice in an envelope with postage prepaid and addressed to that person at his last known address and the loss of driving privileges shall be effective on the 46th day following the date notice was given.
    Upon receipt of the sworn report of a law enforcement officer, the Secretary of State shall also give notice of the suspension and disqualification to the driver by mailing a notice of the effective date of the suspension and disqualification to the individual. However, should the sworn report be defective by not containing sufficient information or be completed in error, the notice of the suspension and disqualification shall not be mailed to the person or entered to the driving record, but rather the sworn report shall be returned to the issuing law enforcement agency.
    (e) A driver may contest this suspension and disqualification by requesting an administrative hearing with the Secretary of State in accordance with Section 2-118 of this Code. An individual whose blood alcohol concentration is shown to be more than 0.00 is not subject to this Section if he or she consumed alcohol in the performance of a religious service or ceremony. An individual whose blood alcohol concentration is shown to be more than 0.00 shall not be subject to this Section if the individual's blood alcohol concentration resulted only from ingestion of the prescribed or recommended dosage of medicine that contained alcohol. The petition for that hearing shall not stay or delay the effective date of the impending suspension. The scope of this hearing shall be limited to the issues of:
        (1) whether the police officer had probable cause to
    	
believe that the person was driving or in actual physical control of a motor vehicle upon the public highways of the State and the police officer had reason to believe that the person was in violation of any provision of the Illinois Vehicle Code or a similar provision of a local ordinance; and
        (2) whether the person was issued a Uniform Traffic
    	
Ticket for any violation of the Illinois Vehicle Code or a similar provision of a local ordinance; and
        (3) whether the police officer had probable cause to
    	
believe that the driver had consumed any amount of an alcoholic beverage based upon the driver's physical actions or other first-hand knowledge of the police officer; and
        (4) whether the person, after being advised by the
    	
officer that the privilege to operate a motor vehicle would be suspended if the person refused to submit to and complete the test or tests, did refuse to submit to or complete the test or tests to determine the person's alcohol concentration; and
        (5) whether the person, after being advised by the
    	
officer that the privileges to operate a motor vehicle would be suspended if the person submits to a chemical test or tests and the test or tests disclose an alcohol concentration of more than 0.00, did submit to and complete the test or tests that determined an alcohol concentration of more than 0.00; and
        (6) whether the test result of an alcohol
    	
concentration of more than 0.00 was based upon the person's consumption of alcohol in the performance of a religious service or ceremony; and
        (7) whether the test result of an alcohol
    	
concentration of more than 0.00 was based upon the person's consumption of alcohol through ingestion of the prescribed or recommended dosage of medicine.
    At the conclusion of the hearing held under Section 2-118 of this Code, the Secretary of State may rescind, continue, or modify the suspension and disqualification. If the Secretary of State does not rescind the suspension and disqualification, a restricted driving permit may be granted by the Secretary of State upon application being made and good cause shown. A restricted driving permit may be granted to relieve undue hardship by allowing driving for employment, educational, and medical purposes as outlined in item (3) of part (c) of Section 6-206 of this Code. The provisions of item (3) of part (c) of Section 6-206 of this Code and of subsection (f) of that Section shall apply. The Secretary of State shall promulgate rules providing for participation in an alcohol education and awareness program or activity, a drug education and awareness program or activity, or both as a condition to the issuance of a restricted driving permit for suspensions imposed under this Section.
    (f) The results of any chemical testing performed in accordance with subsection (a) of this Section are not admissible in any civil or criminal proceeding, except that the results of the testing may be considered at a hearing held under Section 2-118 of this Code. However, the results of the testing may not be used to impose driver's license sanctions under Section 11-501.1 of this Code. A law enforcement officer may, however, pursue a statutory summary suspension or revocation of driving privileges under Section 11-501.1 of this Code if other physical evidence or first hand knowledge forms the basis of that suspension or revocation.
    (g) This Section applies only to drivers who are under age 21 at the time of the issuance of a Uniform Traffic Ticket for a violation of the Illinois Vehicle Code or a similar provision of a local ordinance, and a chemical test request is made under this Section.
    (h) The action of the Secretary of State in suspending, revoking, cancelling, or disqualifying any license or permit shall be subject to judicial review in the Circuit Court of Sangamon County or in the Circuit Court of Cook County, and the provisions of the Administrative Review Law and its rules are hereby adopted and shall apply to and govern every action for the judicial review of final acts or decisions of the Secretary of State under this Section.

    Sec. 11-501.9. Suspension of driver's license; failure or refusal of validated roadside chemical tests; failure or refusal of field sobriety tests; implied consent.
    (a) A person who drives or is in actual physical control of a motor vehicle upon the public highways of this State shall be deemed to have given consent to (i) validated roadside chemical tests or (ii) standardized field sobriety tests approved by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, under subsection (a-5) of Section 11-501.2 of this Code, if detained by a law enforcement officer who has a reasonable suspicion that the person is driving or is in actual physical control of a motor vehicle while impaired by the use of cannabis. The law enforcement officer must have an independent, cannabis-related factual basis giving reasonable suspicion that the person is driving or in actual physical control of a motor vehicle while impaired by the use of cannabis for conducting validated roadside chemical tests or standardized field sobriety tests, which shall be included with the results of the validated roadside chemical tests and field sobriety tests in any report made by the law enforcement officer who requests the test. The person's possession of a registry identification card issued under the Compassionate Use of Medical Cannabis Pilot Program Act alone is not a sufficient basis for reasonable suspicion.
    For purposes of this Section, a law enforcement officer of this State who is investigating a person for an offense under Section 11-501 of this Code may travel into an adjoining state where the person has been transported for medical care to complete an investigation and to request that the person submit to field sobriety tests under this Section.
    (b) A person who is unconscious, or otherwise in a condition rendering the person incapable of refusal, shall be deemed to have withdrawn the consent provided by subsection (a) of this Section.
    (c) A person requested to submit to validated roadside chemical tests or field sobriety tests, as provided in this Section, shall be warned by the law enforcement officer requesting the field sobriety tests that a refusal to submit to the validated roadside chemical tests or field sobriety tests will result in the suspension of the person's privilege to operate a motor vehicle, as provided in subsection (f) of this Section. The person shall also be warned by the law enforcement officer that if the person submits to validated roadside chemical tests or field sobriety tests as provided in this Section which disclose the person is impaired by the use of cannabis, a suspension of the person's privilege to operate a motor vehicle, as provided in subsection (f) of this Section, will be imposed.
    (d) The results of validated roadside chemical tests or field sobriety tests administered under this Section shall be admissible in a civil or criminal action or proceeding arising from an arrest for an offense as defined in Section 11-501 of this Code or a similar provision of a local ordinance. These test results shall be admissible only in actions or proceedings directly related to the incident upon which the test request was made.
    (e) If the person refuses validated roadside chemical tests or field sobriety tests or submits to validated roadside chemical tests or field sobriety tests that disclose the person is impaired by the use of cannabis, the law enforcement officer shall immediately submit a sworn report to the circuit court of venue and the Secretary of State certifying that testing was requested under this Section and that the person refused to submit to validated roadside chemical tests or field sobriety tests or submitted to validated roadside chemical tests or field sobriety tests that disclosed the person was impaired by the use of cannabis. The sworn report must include the law enforcement officer's factual basis for reasonable suspicion that the person was impaired by the use of cannabis.
    (f) Upon receipt of the sworn report of a law enforcement officer submitted under subsection (e) of this Section, the Secretary of State shall enter the suspension to the driving record as follows:
        (1) for refusal or failure to complete validated
    	
roadside chemical tests or field sobriety tests, a 12 month suspension shall be entered; or
        (2) for submitting to validated roadside chemical
    	
tests or field sobriety tests that disclosed the driver was impaired by the use of cannabis, a 6 month suspension shall be entered.
    The Secretary of State shall confirm the suspension by mailing a notice of the effective date of the suspension to the person and the court of venue. However, should the sworn report be defective for insufficient information or be completed in error, the confirmation of the suspension shall not be mailed to the person or entered to the record; instead, the sworn report shall be forwarded to the court of venue with a copy returned to the issuing agency identifying the defect.
    (g) The law enforcement officer submitting the sworn report under subsection (e) of this Section shall serve immediate notice of the suspension on the person and the suspension shall be effective as provided in subsection (h) of this Section. If immediate notice of the suspension cannot be given, the arresting officer or arresting agency shall give notice by deposit in the United States mail of the notice in an envelope with postage prepaid and addressed to the person at his or her address as shown on the Uniform Traffic Ticket and the suspension shall begin as provided in subsection (h) of this Section. The officer shall confiscate any Illinois driver's license or permit on the person at the time of arrest. If the person has a valid driver's license or permit, the officer shall issue the person a receipt, in a form prescribed by the Secretary of State, that will allow the person to drive during the period provided for in subsection (h) of this Section. The officer shall immediately forward the driver's license or permit to the circuit court of venue along with the sworn report under subsection (e) of this Section.
    (h) The suspension under subsection (f) of this Section shall take effect on the 46th day following the date the notice of the suspension was given to the person.
    (i) When a driving privilege has been suspended under this Section and the person is subsequently convicted of violating Section 11-501 of this Code, or a similar provision of a local ordinance, for the same incident, any period served on suspension under this Section shall be credited toward the minimum period of revocation of driving privileges imposed under Section 6-205 of this Code.

ARTICLE VI. SPEED RESTRICTIONS

    (625 ILCS 5/11-601) (from Ch. 95 1/2, par. 11-601)
    Sec. 11-601. General speed restrictions.
    (a) No vehicle may be driven upon any highway of this State at a speed which is greater than is reasonable and proper with regard to traffic conditions and the use of the highway, or endangers the safety of any person or property. The fact that the speed of a vehicle does not exceed the applicable maximum speed limit does not relieve the driver from the duty to decrease speed when approaching and crossing an intersection, approaching and going around a curve, when approaching a hill crest, when traveling upon any narrow or winding roadway, or when special hazard exists with respect to pedestrians or other traffic or by reason of weather or highway conditions. Speed must be decreased as may be necessary to avoid colliding with any person or vehicle on or entering the highway in compliance with legal requirements and the duty of all persons to use due care.
    (a-5) For purposes of this Section, "urban district" does not include any interstate highway as defined by Section 1-133.1 of this Code which includes all highways under the jurisdiction of the Illinois State Toll Highway Authority.
    (b) No person may drive a vehicle upon any highway of this State at a speed which is greater than the applicable statutory maximum speed limit established by paragraphs (c), (d), (e), (f) or (g) of this Section, by Section 11-605 or by a regulation or ordinance made under this Chapter.
    (c) Unless some other speed restriction is established under this Chapter, the maximum speed limit in an urban district for all vehicles is:
        1. 30 miles per hour; and
        2. 15 miles per hour in an alley.
    (d) Unless some other speed restriction is established under this Chapter, the maximum speed limit outside an urban district for any vehicle is (1) 65 miles per hour for all or part of highways that are designated by the Department, have at least 4 lanes of traffic, and have a separation between the roadways moving in opposite directions and (2) 55 miles per hour for all other highways, roads, and streets.
    (d-1) Unless some other speed restriction is established under this Chapter, the maximum speed limit outside an urban district for any vehicle is (1) 70 miles per hour on any interstate highway as defined by Section 1-133.1 of this Code which includes all highways under the jurisdiction of the Illinois State Toll Highway Authority; (2) 65 miles per hour for all or part of highways that are designated by the Department, have at least 4 lanes of traffic, and have a separation between the roadways moving in opposite directions; and (3) 55 miles per hour for all other highways, roads, and streets. The counties of Cook, DuPage, Kane, Lake, Madison, McHenry, St. Clair, and Will may adopt ordinances setting a maximum speed limit on highways, roads, and streets that is lower than the limits established by this Section.
    (e) In the counties of Cook, DuPage, Kane, Lake, McHenry, and Will, unless some lesser speed restriction is established under this Chapter, the maximum speed limit outside an urban district for a second division vehicle designed or used for the carrying of a gross weight of 8,001 pounds or more (including the weight of the vehicle and maximum load) is 60 miles per hour on any interstate highway as defined by Section 1-133.1 of this Code and 55 miles per hour on all other highways, roads, and streets.
    (e-1) (Blank).
    (f) Unless some other speed restriction is established under this Chapter, the maximum speed limit outside an urban district for a bus is:
        1. 65 miles per hour upon any highway which has at
    	
least 4 lanes of traffic and of which the roadways for traffic moving in opposite directions are separated by a strip of ground which is not surfaced or suitable for vehicular traffic, except that the maximum speed limit for a bus on all highways, roads, or streets not under the jurisdiction of the Department or the Illinois State Toll Highway Authority is 55 miles per hour;
        1.5. 70 miles per hour upon any interstate highway as
    	
defined by Section 1-133.1 of this Code outside the counties of Cook, DuPage, Kane, Lake, McHenry, and Will; and
        2. 55 miles per hour on any other highway.

    (a) A person who drives a vehicle upon any highway of this State at a speed that is 26 miles per hour or more but less than 35 miles per hour in excess of the applicable maximum speed limit established under this Chapter or a local ordinance commits a Class B misdemeanor.
    (b) A person who drives a vehicle upon any highway of this State at a speed that is 35 miles per hour or more in excess of the applicable maximum speed limit established under this Chapter or a local ordinance commits a Class A misdemeanor.

Whenever the Department determines, upon the basis of an engineering and traffic investigation concerning any highway for which the Department has maintenance responsibility, that a maximum speed limit prescribed in Section 11-601 of this Chapter is greater or less than is reasonable or safe with respect to the conditions found to exist at any intersection or other place on such highway or along any part or zone thereof, the Department shall determine and declare a reasonable and safe absolute maximum speed limit applicable to such intersection or place, or along such part or zone. However, such limit shall conform with the maximum speed limit restrictions provided for in Section 11-601 of this Code. Where a highway under the Department's jurisdiction is contiguous to school property, the Department may, at the school district's request, set a reduced maximum speed limit for student safety purposes in the portion of the highway that faces the school property and in the portions of the highway that extend one-quarter mile in each direction from the opposite ends of the school property. A limit determined and declared as provided in this Section becomes effective, and suspends the applicability of the limit prescribed in Section 11-601 of this Chapter, when appropriate signs giving notice of the limit are erected at such intersection or other place, or along such part or zone of the highway. Electronic speed-detecting devices shall not be used within 500 feet beyond any such sign in the direction of travel; if so used in violation hereof, evidence obtained thereby shall be inadmissible in any prosecution for speeding. However, nothing in this Section prohibits the use of such electronic speed-detecting devices within 500 feet of a sign within a special school speed zone indicating such zone, conforming to the requirements of Section 11-605 of this Act, nor shall evidence obtained thereby be inadmissible in any prosecution for speeding provided the use of such device shall apply only to the enforcement of the speed limit in such special school speed zone.

Whenever the Illinois State Toll Highway Authority determines, upon the basis of an engineering and traffic investigation concerning a toll highway under its jurisdiction, that a maximum speed limit prescribed in Section 11-601 of this Chapter is greater or less than is reasonable or safe with respect to conditions found to exist at any place or along any part or zone of such highway, the Authority shall determine and declare by regulation a reasonable and safe absolute maximum speed limit at such place or along such part or zone, and the speed limit shall conform with the maximum speed limit restrictions provided for in Section 11-601 of this Code. A limit so determined and declared becomes effective, and suspends the application of the limit prescribed in Section 11-601 of this Chapter, when (a) the Department concurs in writing with the Authority's regulation, and (b) appropriate signs giving notice of the limit are erected at such place or along such part or zone of the highway. Electronic speed-detecting devices shall not be used within 500 feet beyond any such sign in the direction of travel; if so used in violation hereof, evidence obtained thereby shall be inadmissible in any prosecution for speeding.

    Sec. 11-604. Alteration of limits by local authorities.
    (a) Subject to the limitations set forth in this Section, the county board of a county may establish absolute maximum speed limits on all county highways, township roads and district roads as defined in the Illinois Highway Code, except those under the jurisdiction of the Department or of the Illinois State Toll Highway Authority, as described in Sections 11-602 and 11-603 of this Chapter; and any park district, city, village, or incorporated town may establish absolute maximum speed limits on all streets which are within its corporate limits and which are not under the jurisdiction of the Department or of such Authority, and for which the county or a highway commissioner of such county does not have maintenance responsibility.
    (b) Whenever any such park district, city, village, or incorporated town determines, upon the basis of an engineering or traffic investigation concerning a highway or street on which it is authorized by this Section to establish speed limits, that a maximum speed limit prescribed in Section 11-601 of this Chapter is greater or less than is reasonable or safe with respect to the conditions found to exist at any place or along any part or zone of such highway or street, the local authority or park district shall determine and declare by ordinance a reasonable and safe absolute maximum speed limit at such place or along such part or zone, which:
        (1) Decreases the limit within an urban district, but
    	
not to less than 20 miles per hour; or
        (2) Increases the limit within an urban district, but
    	
not to more than 55 miles per hour; or
        (3) Decreases the limit outside of an urban district,
    	
but not to less than 35 miles per hour, except as otherwise provided in subparagraph 4 of this paragraph; or
        (4) Decreases the limit within a residence district,
    	
but not to less than 25 miles per hour, except as otherwise provided in subparagraph 1 of this paragraph.
    The park district, city, village, or incorporated town may make such limit applicable at all times or only during certain specified times. Not more than 6 such alterations shall be made per mile along a highway or street; and the difference in limit between adjacent altered speed zones shall not be more than 10 miles per hour.
    A limit so determined and declared by a park district, city, village, or incorporated town becomes effective, and suspends the application of the limit prescribed in Section 11-601 of this Chapter, when appropriate signs giving notice of the limit are erected at the proper place or along the proper part or zone of the highway or street. Electronic speed-detecting devices shall not be used within 500 feet beyond any such sign in the direction of travel; if so used in violation of this Section evidence obtained thereby shall be inadmissible in any prosecution for speeding. However, nothing in this Section prohibits the use of such electronic speed-detecting devices within 500 feet of a sign within a special school speed zone indicating such zone, conforming to the requirements of Section 11-605 of this Act, nor shall evidence obtained thereby be inadmissible in any prosecution for speeding provided the use of such device shall apply only to the enforcement of the speed limit in such special school speed zone.
    (c) A county engineer or superintendent of highways may submit to the Department for approval, a county policy for establishing altered speed zones on township and county highways based upon engineering and traffic investigations.
    (d) Whenever the county board of a county determines that a maximum speed limit is greater or less than is reasonable or safe with respect to the conditions found to exist at any place or along any part or zone of the highway or road, the county board shall determine and declare by ordinance a reasonable and safe absolute maximum speed limit at that place or along that part or zone. However, the maximum speed limit shall not exceed 55 miles per hour. Upon receipt of an engineering study for the part or zone of highway in question from the county engineer, and notwithstanding any other provision of law, the county board of a county may determine and declare by ordinance a reduction in the maximum speed limit at any place or along any part or zone of a county highway whenever the county board, in its sole discretion, determines that the reduction in the maximum speed limit is reasonable and safe. The county board may post signs designating the new speed limit. The limit becomes effective, and suspends the application of the limit prescribed in Section 11-601 of this Chapter, when appropriate signs giving notice of the limit are erected at the proper place or along the proper part of the zone of the highway. Electronic speed-detecting devices shall not be used within 500 feet beyond any such sign in the direction of travel; if so used in violation of this Section, evidence obtained thereby shall be inadmissible in any prosecution for speeding. However, nothing in this Section prohibits the use of such electronic speed-detecting devices within 500 feet of a sign within a special school speed zone indicating such zone, conforming to the requirements of Section 11-605 of this Act, nor shall evidence obtained thereby be inadmissible in any prosecution for speeding provided the use of such device shall apply only to the enforcement of the speed limit in such special school speed zone.

    (a) Preferential right-of-way at an intersection may be indicated by stop or yield signs as authorized in Section 11-302 of this Chapter.
    (b) Except when directed to proceed by a police officer or traffic-control signal, every driver of a vehicle approaching a stop intersection indicated by a stop sign shall stop at a clearly marked stop line, but if none, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the intersection, or if none, then at the point nearest the intersecting roadway where the driver has a view of approaching traffic on the intersecting roadway before entering the intersection. After having stopped, the driver shall yield the right-of-way to any vehicle which has entered the intersection from another roadway or which is approaching so closely on the roadway as to constitute an immediate hazard during the time when the driver is moving across or within the intersection, but said driver having so yielded may proceed at such time as a safe interval occurs.
    (c) The driver of a vehicle approaching a yield sign shall in obedience to such sign slow down to a speed reasonable for the existing conditions and, if required for safety to stop, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line, but if none, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the intersection, or if none, then at the point nearest the intersecting roadway where the driver has a view of approaching traffic on the intersecting roadway. After slowing or stopping, the driver shall yield the right-of-way to any vehicle in the intersection or approaching on another roadway so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the time such driver is moving across or within the intersection.
    (d) If a driver is involved in a collision at an intersection or interferes with the movement of other vehicles after driving past a yield right-of-way sign, such collision or interference shall be deemed prima facie evidence of the driver's failure to yield right-of-way.

    (a) Upon the immediate approach of an authorized emergency vehicle making use of audible and visual signals meeting the requirements of this Code or a police vehicle properly and lawfully making use of an audible or visual signal:
        (1) the driver of every other vehicle shall yield the
    	
right-of-way and shall immediately drive to a position parallel to, and as close as possible to, the right-hand edge or curb of the highway clear of any intersection and shall, if necessary to permit the safe passage of the emergency vehicle, stop and remain in such position until the authorized emergency vehicle has passed, unless otherwise directed by a police officer; and
        (2) the operator of every streetcar shall immediately
    	
stop such car clear of any intersection and keep it in such position until the authorized emergency vehicle has passed, unless otherwise directed by a police officer.
    (b) This Section shall not operate to relieve the driver of an authorized emergency vehicle from the duty to drive with due regard for the safety of all persons using the highway.
    (c) Upon approaching a stationary authorized emergency vehicle, when the authorized emergency vehicle is giving a signal by displaying alternately flashing red, red and white, blue, or red and blue lights or amber or yellow warning lights, a person who drives an approaching vehicle shall:
        (1) proceeding with due caution, yield the
    	
right-of-way by making a lane change into a lane not adjacent to that of the authorized emergency vehicle, if possible with due regard to safety and traffic conditions, if on a highway having at least 4 lanes with not less than 2 lanes proceeding in the same direction as the approaching vehicle; or
        (2) if changing lanes would be impossible or unsafe,
    	
proceeding with due caution, reduce the speed of the vehicle, maintaining a safe speed for road conditions and leaving a safe distance until safely past the stationary vehicles.
    As used in this subsection (c), "authorized emergency vehicle" includes any vehicle authorized by law to be equipped with oscillating, rotating, or flashing lights under Section 12-215 of this Code, while the owner or operator of the vehicle is engaged in his or her official duties.
    (d) A person who violates subsection (c) of this Section commits a business offense punishable by a fine of not less than $250 or more than $10,000 for a first violation, and a fine of not less than $750 or more than $10,000 for a second or subsequent violation. It is a factor in aggravation if the person committed the offense while in violation of Section 11-501 of this Code. Imposition of the penalties authorized by this subsection (d) for a violation of subsection (c) of this Section that results in the death of another person does not preclude imposition of appropriate additional civil or criminal penalties. A person who violates subsection (c) and the violation results in damage to another vehicle commits a Class A misdemeanor. A person who violates subsection (c) and the violation results in the injury or death of another person commits a Class 4 felony.
    (e) If a violation of subsection (c) of this Section results in damage to the property of another person, in addition to any other penalty imposed, the person's driving privileges shall be suspended for a fixed period of not less than 90 days and not more than one year.
    (f) If a violation of subsection (c) of this Section results in injury to another person, in addition to any other penalty imposed, the person's driving privileges shall be suspended for a fixed period of not less than 180 days and not more than 2 years.
    (g) If a violation of subsection (c) of this Section results in the death of another person, in addition to any other penalty imposed, the person's driving privileges shall be suspended for 2 years.
    (h) The Secretary of State shall, upon receiving a record of a judgment entered against a person under subsection (c) of this Section:
        (1) suspend the person's driving privileges for the
    	
mandatory period; or
        (2) extend the period of an existing suspension by
    	
the appropriate mandatory period.
    (i) The Scott's Law Fund shall be a special fund in the State treasury. Subject to appropriation by the General Assembly and approval by the Director, the Director of the State Police shall use all moneys in the Scott's Law Fund in the Department's discretion to fund the production of materials to educate drivers on approaching stationary authorized emergency vehicles, to hire off-duty Department of State Police for enforcement of this Section, and for other law enforcement purposes the Director deems necessary in these efforts.
    (j) For violations of this Section issued by a county or municipal police officer, the assessment shall be deposited into the county's or municipality's Transportation Safety Highway Hire-back Fund. The county shall use the moneys in its Transportation Safety Highway Hire-back Fund to hire off-duty county police officers to monitor construction or maintenance zones in that county on highways other than interstate highways. The county, in its discretion, may also use a portion of the moneys in its Transportation Safety Highway Hire-back Fund to purchase equipment for county law enforcement and fund the production of materials to educate drivers on construction zone safe driving habits and approaching stationary authorized emergency vehicles.

    (625 ILCS 5/11-1201) (from Ch. 95 1/2, par. 11-1201)
    Sec. 11-1201. Obedience to signal indicating approach of train or railroad track equipment.
    (a) Whenever any person driving a vehicle approaches a railroad grade crossing where the driver is not always required to stop, the person must exercise due care and caution as the existence of a railroad track across a highway is a warning of danger, and under any of the circumstances stated in this Section, the driver shall stop within 50 feet but not less than 15 feet from the nearest rail of the railroad and shall not proceed until the tracks are clear and he or she can do so safely. The foregoing requirements shall apply when:
        1. A clearly visible electric or mechanical signal
    	
device gives warning of the immediate approach of a railroad train or railroad track equipment;
        2. A crossing gate is lowered or a human flagman
    	
gives or continues to give a signal of the approach or passage of a railroad train or railroad track equipment;
        3. A railroad train or railroad track equipment
    	
approaching a highway crossing emits a warning signal and such railroad train or railroad track equipment, by reason of its speed or nearness to such crossing, is an immediate hazard;
        4. An approaching railroad train or railroad track
    	
equipment is plainly visible and is in hazardous proximity to such crossing;
        5. A railroad train or railroad track equipment is
    	
approaching so closely that an immediate hazard is created.
    (a-5) Whenever a person driving a vehicle approaches a railroad grade crossing where the driver is not always required to stop but must slow down, the person must exercise due care and caution as the existence of a railroad track across a highway is a warning of danger, and under any of the circumstances stated in this Section, the driver shall slow down within 50 feet but not less than 15 feet from the nearest rail of the railroad and shall not proceed until he or she checks that the tracks are clear of an approaching train or railroad track equipment.
    (b) No person shall drive any vehicle through, around or under any crossing gate or barrier at a railroad crossing while such gate or barrier is closed or is being opened or closed.
    (c) The Department, and local authorities with the approval of the Department, are hereby authorized to designate particularly dangerous highway grade crossings of railroads and to erect stop signs thereat. When such stop signs are erected the driver of any vehicle shall stop within 50 feet but not less than 15 feet from the nearest rail of such railroad and shall proceed only upon exercising due care.
    (d) At any railroad grade crossing provided with railroad crossbuck signs, without automatic, electric, or mechanical signal devices, crossing gates, or a human flagman giving a signal of the approach or passage of a train or railroad track equipment, the driver of a vehicle shall in obedience to the railroad crossbuck sign, yield the right-of-way and slow down to a speed reasonable for the existing conditions and shall stop, if required for safety, at a clearly marked stopped line, or if no stop line, within 50 feet but not less than 15 feet from the nearest rail of the railroad and shall not proceed until he or she can do so safely. If a driver is involved in a collision at a railroad crossing or interferes with the movement of a train or railroad track equipment after driving past the railroad crossbuck sign, the collision or interference is prima facie evidence of the driver's failure to yield right-of-way.
    (d-1) No person shall, while driving a commercial motor vehicle, fail to negotiate a railroad-highway grade railroad crossing because of insufficient undercarriage clearance.
    (d-5) (Blank).
    (e) It is unlawful to violate any part of this Section.
        (1) A violation of this Section is a petty offense
    	
for which a fine of $500 shall be imposed for a first violation, and a fine of $1,000 shall be imposed for a second or subsequent violation. The court may impose 25 hours of community service in place of the $500 fine for the first violation.
        (2) For a second or subsequent violation, the
    	
Secretary of State may suspend the driving privileges of the offender for a minimum of 6 months.
    (f) Corporate authorities of municipal corporations regulating operators of vehicles that fail to obey signals indicating the presence, approach, passage, or departure of a train or railroad track equipment shall impose fines as established in subsection (e) of this Section.

    Sec. 11-1201.1. Automated Railroad Crossing Enforcement System.
    (a) For the purposes of this Section, an automated railroad grade crossing enforcement system is a system in a municipality or county operated by a governmental agency that produces a recorded image of a motor vehicle's violation of a provision of this Code or local ordinance and is designed to obtain a clear recorded image of the vehicle and vehicle's license plate. The recorded image must also display the time, date, and location of the violation.
    As used in this Section, "recorded images" means images recorded by an automated railroad grade crossing enforcement system on:
        (1) 2 or more photographs;
        (2) 2 or more microphotographs;
        (3) 2 or more electronic images; or
        (4) a video recording showing the motor vehicle and,
    	
on at least one image or portion of the recording, clearly identifying the registration plate or digital registration plate number of the motor vehicle.
    (b) The Illinois Commerce Commission may, in cooperation with a local law enforcement agency, establish in any county or municipality an automated railroad grade crossing enforcement system at any railroad grade crossing equipped with a crossing gate designated by local authorities. Local authorities desiring the establishment of an automated railroad crossing enforcement system must initiate the process by enacting a local ordinance requesting the creation of such a system. After the ordinance has been enacted, and before any additional steps toward the establishment of the system are undertaken, the local authorities and the Commission must agree to a plan for obtaining, from any combination of federal, State, and local funding sources, the moneys required for the purchase and installation of any necessary equipment.
    (b-1) (Blank.)
    (c) For each violation of Section 11-1201 of this Code or a local ordinance recorded by an automated railroad grade crossing enforcement system, the county or municipality having jurisdiction shall issue a written notice of the violation to the registered owner of the vehicle as the alleged violator. The notice shall be delivered to the registered owner of the vehicle, by mail, no later than 90 days after the violation.
    The notice shall include:
        (1) the name and address of the registered owner of
    	
the vehicle;
        (2) the registration number of the motor vehicle

date by which the civil penalty should be paid;
        (8) a statement that recorded images are evidence of
    	
a violation of a railroad grade crossing;
        (9) a warning that failure to pay the civil penalty
    	
or to contest liability in a timely manner is an admission of liability and may result in a suspension of the driving privileges of the registered owner of the vehicle; and
        (10) a statement that the person may elect to proceed
    	
by:
            (A) paying the fine; or
            (B) challenging the charge in court, by mail, or
        	
by administrative hearing.
    (d) If a person charged with a traffic violation, as a result of an automated railroad grade crossing enforcement system, does not pay or successfully contest the civil penalty resulting from that violation, the Secretary of State shall suspend the driving privileges of the registered owner of the vehicle under Section 6-306.5 of this Code for failing to pay any fine or penalty due and owing as a result of 5 violations of the automated railroad grade crossing enforcement system.
    (d-1) (Blank.)
    (d-2) (Blank.)
    (e) Based on inspection of recorded images produced by an automated railroad grade crossing enforcement system, a notice alleging that the violation occurred shall be evidence of the facts contained in the notice and admissible in any proceeding alleging a violation under this Section.
    (e-1) Recorded images made by an automated railroad grade crossing enforcement system are confidential and shall be made available only to the alleged violator and governmental and law enforcement agencies for purposes of adjudicating a violation of this Section, for statistical purposes, or for other governmental purposes. Any recorded image evidencing a violation of this Section, however, may be admissible in any proceeding resulting from the issuance of the citation.
    (e-2) The court or hearing officer may consider the following in the defense of a violation:
        (1) that the motor vehicle or registration plates or
    	
digital registration plates of the motor vehicle were stolen before the violation occurred and not under the control of or in the possession of the owner at the time of the violation;
        (2) that the driver of the motor vehicle received a
    	
Uniform Traffic Citation from a police officer at the time of the violation for the same offense;
        (3) any other evidence or issues provided by
    	
municipal or county ordinance.
    (e-3) To demonstrate that the motor vehicle or the registration plates or digital registration plates were stolen before the violation occurred and were not under the control or possession of the owner at the time of the violation, the owner must submit proof that a report concerning the stolen motor vehicle or registration plates was filed with a law enforcement agency in a timely manner.
    (f) Rail crossings equipped with an automatic railroad grade crossing enforcement system shall be posted with a sign visible to approaching traffic stating that the railroad grade crossing is being monitored, that citations will be issued, and the amount of the fine for violation.
    (g) The compensation paid for an automated railroad grade crossing enforcement system must be based on the value of the equipment or the services provided and may not be based on the number of citations issued or the revenue generated by the system.
    (h) (Blank.)
    (i) If any part or parts of this Section are held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be unconstitutional, the unconstitutionality shall not affect the validity of the remaining parts of this Section. The General Assembly hereby declares that it would have passed the remaining parts of this Section if it had known that the other part or parts of this Section would be declared unconstitutional.
    (j) Penalty. A civil fine of $250 shall be imposed for a first violation of this Section, and a civil fine of $500 shall be imposed for a second or subsequent violation of this Section.

    (e) Based on inspection of recorded images produced by an automated railroad grade crossing enforcement system, a notice alleging that the violation occurred shall be evidence of the facts contained in the notice and admissible in any proceeding alleging a violation under this Section.
    (e-1) Recorded images made by an automated railroad grade crossing enforcement system are confidential and shall be made available only to the alleged violator and governmental and law enforcement agencies for purposes of adjudicating a violation of this Section, for statistical purposes, or for other governmental purposes. Any recorded image evidencing a violation of this Section, however, may be admissible in any proceeding resulting from the issuance of the citation.
    (e-2) The court or hearing officer may consider the following in the defense of a violation:
        (1) that the motor vehicle or registration plates or

    (h) (Blank.)
    (i) If any part or parts of this Section are held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be unconstitutional, the unconstitutionality shall not affect the validity of the remaining parts of this Section. The General Assembly hereby declares that it would have passed the remaining parts of this Section if it had known that the other part or parts of this Section would be declared unconstitutional.

    (a) A motor vehicle bearing registration plates or digital registration plates issued to a person with disabilities, as defined by Section 1-159.1, pursuant to Section 3-616 or to a veteran with a disability pursuant to subsection (a) of Section 3-609 or a special decal or device issued pursuant to Section 3-616 or pursuant to Section 11-1301.2 of this Code or a motor vehicle registered in another jurisdiction, state, district, territory or foreign country upon which is displayed a registration plate or digital registration plate, special decal or device issued by the other jurisdiction designating the vehicle is operated by or for a person with disabilities shall be exempt from the payment of parking meter fees until January 1, 2014, and exempt from any statute or ordinance imposing time limitations on parking, except limitations of one-half hour or less, on any street or highway zone, a parking area subject to regulation under subsection (a) of Section 11-209 of this Code, or any parking lot or parking place which are owned, leased or owned and leased by a municipality or a municipal parking utility; and shall be recognized by state and local authorities as a valid license plate or parking device and shall receive the same parking privileges as residents of this State; but, such vehicle shall be subject to the laws which prohibit parking in "no stopping" and "no standing" zones in front of or near fire hydrants, driveways, public building entrances and exits, bus stops and loading areas, and is prohibited from parking where the motor vehicle constitutes a traffic hazard, whereby such motor vehicle shall be moved at the instruction and request of a law enforcement officer to a location designated by the officer.
    (b) Any motor vehicle bearing registration plates or digital registration plates or a special decal or device specified in this Section or in Section 3-616 of this Code or such parking device as specifically authorized in Section 11-1301.2 as evidence that the vehicle is operated by or for a person with disabilities or bearing registration plates or digital registration plates issued to a veteran with a disability under subsection (a) of Section 3-609 may park, in addition to any other lawful place, in any parking place specifically reserved for such vehicles by the posting of an official sign as provided under Section 11-301.

    Sec. 11-1301.2. Special decals for parking; persons with disabilities.
    (a) The Secretary of State shall provide for, by administrative rules, the design, size, color, and placement of a person with disabilities motorist decal or device and shall provide for, by administrative rules, the content and form of an application for a person with disabilities motorist decal or device, which shall be used by local authorities in the issuance thereof to a person with temporary disabilities, provided that the decal or device is valid for no more than 90 days, subject to renewal for like periods based upon continued disability, and further provided that the decal or device clearly sets forth the date that the decal or device expires. The application shall include the requirement of an Illinois Identification Card number or a State of Illinois driver's license number or, if the applicant does not have an identification card or driver's license number, then the applicant may use a valid identification number issued by a branch of the U.S. military or a federally issued Medicare or Medicaid identification number. This decal or device may be used by the authorized holder to designate and identify a vehicle not owned or displaying a registration plate or digital registration plate as provided in Sections 3-609 and 3-616 of this Act to designate when the vehicle is being used to transport said person or persons with disabilities, and thus is entitled to enjoy all the privileges that would be afforded a person with disabilities licensed vehicle. Person with disabilities decals or devices issued and displayed pursuant to this Section shall be recognized and honored by all local authorities regardless of which local authority issued such decal or device.
    The decal or device shall be issued only upon a showing by adequate documentation that the person for whose benefit the decal or device is to be used has a disability as defined in Section 1-159.1 of this Code and the disability is temporary.
    (b) The local governing authorities shall be responsible for the provision of such decal or device, its issuance and designated placement within the vehicle. The cost of such decal or device shall be at the discretion of such local governing authority.
    (c) The Secretary of State may, pursuant to Section 3-616(c), issue a person with disabilities parking decal or device to a person with disabilities as defined by Section 1-159.1. Any person with disabilities parking decal or device issued by the Secretary of State shall be registered to that person with disabilities in the form to be prescribed by the Secretary of State. The person with disabilities parking decal or device shall not display that person's address. One additional decal or device may be issued to an applicant upon his or her written request and with the approval of the Secretary of State. The written request must include a justification of the need for the additional decal or device.
    (c-5) Beginning January 1, 2014, the Secretary shall provide by administrative rule for the issuance of a separate and distinct parking decal or device for persons with disabilities as defined by Section 1-159.1 of this Code and who meet the qualifications under this subsection. The authorized holder of a decal or device issued under this subsection (c-5) shall be exempt from the payment of fees generated by parking in a metered space, a parking area subject to paragraph (10) of subsection (a) of Section 11-209 of this Code, or a publicly owned parking area.
    The Secretary shall issue a meter-exempt decal or device to a person with disabilities who: (i) has been issued registration plates or digital registration plates under subsection (a) of Section 3-609 or Section 3-616 of this Code or a special decal or device under this Section, (ii) holds a valid Illinois driver's license, and (iii) is unable to do one or more of the following:
        (1) manage, manipulate, or insert coins, or obtain
    	
tickets or tokens in parking meters or ticket machines in parking lots, due to the lack of fine motor control of both hands;
        (2) reach above his or her head to a height of 42
    	
inches from the ground, due to a lack of finger, hand, or upper extremity strength or mobility;
        (3) approach a parking meter due to his or her use of
    	
a wheelchair or other device for mobility; or
        (4) walk more than 20 feet due to an orthopedic,
    	
neurological, cardiovascular, or lung condition in which the degree of debilitation is so severe that it almost completely impedes the ability to walk.
    The application for a meter-exempt parking decal or device shall contain a statement certified by a licensed physician, physician assistant, or advanced practice registered nurse attesting to the permanent nature of the applicant's condition and verifying that the applicant meets the physical qualifications specified in this subsection (c-5).
    Notwithstanding the requirements of this subsection (c-5), the Secretary shall issue a meter-exempt decal or device to a person who has been issued registration plates or digital registration plates under Section 3-616 of this Code or a special decal or device under this Section, if the applicant is the parent or guardian of a person with disabilities who is under 18 years of age and incapable of driving.
    (d) Replacement decals or devices may be issued for lost, stolen, or destroyed decals upon application and payment of a $10 fee. The replacement fee may be waived for individuals that have claimed and received a grant under the Senior Citizens and Persons with Disabilities Property Tax Relief Act.
    (e) A person classified as a veteran under subsection (e) of Section 6-106 of this Code that has been issued a decal or device under this Section shall not be required to submit evidence of disability in order to renew that decal or device if, at the time of initial application, he or she submitted evidence from his or her physician or the Department of Veterans' Affairs that the disability is of a permanent nature. However, the Secretary shall take reasonable steps to ensure the veteran still resides in this State at the time of the renewal. These steps may include requiring the veteran to provide additional documentation or to appear at a Secretary of State facility. To identify veterans who are eligible for this exemption, the Secretary shall compare the list of the persons who have been issued a decal or device to the list of persons who have been issued a vehicle registration plate or digital registration plate for veterans with disabilities under Section 3-609 of this Code, or who are identified as a veteran on their driver's license under Section 6-110 of this Code or on their identification card under Section 4 of the Illinois Identification Card Act.

    (a) It shall be prohibited to park any motor vehicle which is not properly displaying registration plates or decals issued to a person with disabilities, as defined by Section 1-159.1, pursuant to Sections 3-616, 11-1301.1 or 11-1301.2, or to a veteran with a disability pursuant to Section 3-609 of this Act, as evidence that the vehicle is operated by or for a person with disabilities or a veteran with a disability, in any parking place, including any private or public offstreet parking facility, specifically reserved, by the posting of an official sign as designated under Section 11-301, for motor vehicles displaying such registration plates. It shall be prohibited to park any motor vehicle in a designated access aisle adjacent to any parking place specifically reserved for persons with disabilities, by the posting of an official sign as designated under Section 11-301, for motor vehicles displaying such registration plates. When using the parking privileges for persons with disabilities, the parking decal or device must be displayed properly in the vehicle where it is clearly visible to law enforcement personnel, either hanging from the rearview mirror or placed on the dashboard of the vehicle in clear view. Disability license plates and parking decals and devices are not transferable from person to person. Proper usage of the disability license plate or parking decal or device requires the authorized holder to be present and enter or exit the vehicle at the time the parking privileges are being used. It is a violation of this Section to park in a space reserved for a person with disabilities if the authorized holder of the disability license plate or parking decal or device does not enter or exit the vehicle at the time the parking privileges are being used. Any motor vehicle properly displaying a disability license plate or a parking decal or device containing the International symbol of access issued to persons with disabilities by any local authority, state, district, territory or foreign country shall be recognized by State and local authorities as a valid license plate or device and receive the same parking privileges as residents of this State.
    (a-1) An individual with a vehicle displaying disability license plates or a parking decal or device issued to a qualified person with a disability under Sections 3-616, 11-1301.1, or 11-1301.2 or to a veteran with a disability under Section 3-609 is in violation of this Section if (i) the person using the disability license plate or parking decal or device is not the authorized holder of the disability license plate or parking decal or device or is not transporting the authorized holder of the disability license plate or parking decal or device to or from the parking location and (ii) the person uses the disability license plate or parking decal or device to exercise any privileges granted through the disability license plate or parking decals or devices under this Code.
    (a-2) A driver of a vehicle displaying disability license plates or a parking decal or device issued to a qualified person with a disability under Section 3-616, 11-1301.1, or 11-1301.2 or to a veteran with a disability under Section 3-609 is in violation of this Section if (i) the person to whom the disability license plate or parking decal or device was issued is deceased and (ii) the driver uses the disability license plate or parking decal or device to exercise any privileges granted through a disability license plate or parking decal or device under this Code.
    (b) Any person or local authority owning or operating any public or private offstreet parking facility may, after notifying the police or sheriff's department, remove or cause to be removed to the nearest garage or other place of safety any vehicle parked within a stall or space reserved for use by a person with disabilities which does not display person with disabilities registration plates or a special decal or device as required under this Section.
    (c) Any person found guilty of violating the provisions of subsection (a) shall be fined $250 in addition to any costs or charges connected with the removal or storage of any motor vehicle authorized under this Section; but municipalities by ordinance may impose a fine up to $350 and shall display signs indicating the fine imposed. If the amount of the fine is subsequently changed, the municipality shall change the sign to indicate the current amount of the fine. It shall not be a defense to a charge under this Section that either the sign posted pursuant to this Section or the intended accessible parking place does not comply with the technical requirements of Section 11-301, Department regulations, or local ordinance if a reasonable person would be made aware by the sign or notice on or near the parking place that the place is reserved for a person with disabilities.
    (c-1) Any person found guilty of violating the provisions of subsection (a-1) a first time shall be fined $600. Any person found guilty of violating subsection (a-1) a second or subsequent time shall be fined $1,000. Any person who violates subsection (a-2) is guilty of a Class A misdemeanor and shall be fined $2,500. The circuit clerk shall distribute 50% of the fine imposed on any person who is found guilty of or pleads guilty to violating this Section, including any person placed on court supervision for violating this Section, to the law enforcement agency that issued the citation or made the arrest. If more than one law enforcement agency is responsible for issuing the citation or making the arrest, the 50% of the fine imposed shall be shared equally. If an officer of the Secretary of State Department of Police arrested a person for a violation of this Section, 50% of the fine imposed shall be deposited into the Secretary of State Police Services Fund.
    (d) Local authorities shall impose fines as established in subsections (c) and (c-1) for violations of this Section.
    (e) As used in this Section, "authorized holder" means an individual issued a disability license plate under Section 3-616 of this Code, an individual issued a parking decal or device under Section 11-1301.2 of this Code, or an individual issued a license plate for veterans with disabilities under Section 3-609 of this Code.
    (f) Any person who commits a violation of subsection (a-1) or a similar provision of a local ordinance may have his or her driving privileges suspended or revoked by the Secretary of State for a period of time determined by the Secretary of State. Any person who commits a violation of subsection (a-2) or a similar provision of a local ordinance shall have his or her driving privileges revoked by the Secretary of State. The Secretary of State may also suspend or revoke the disability license plates or parking decal or device for a period of time determined by the Secretary of State.
    (g) Any police officer may seize the parking decal or device from any person who commits a violation of this Section. Any police officer may seize the disability license plate upon authorization from the Secretary of State. Any police officer may request that the Secretary of State revoke the parking decal or device or the disability license plate of any person who commits a violation of this Section.

The Secretary of State may, as a condition to the issuance of a restricted driving permit, require the applicant to participate in a designated driver remedial or rehabilitative program. Any conviction for a violation of this subsection shall be included as an offense for the purposes of determining suspension action under any other provision of this Code, provided however, that the penalties provided under this subsection shall be imposed unless those penalties imposed under other applicable provisions are greater.
    The owner of any vehicle alleged to have violated paragraph (a) of this Section shall, upon appropriate demand by the State's Attorney or other designated person acting in response to a signed complaint, provide a written statement or deposition identifying the operator of the vehicle if such operator was not the owner at the time of the alleged violation. Failure to supply such information shall result in the suspension of the vehicle registration of the vehicle for a period of 3 months.

        3. The aforesaid siren and lamp or lamps shall be in
    	
operation at all times when it is reasonably necessary to warn pedestrians and other drivers of the approach thereof during such trip or journey, except that in a municipality with a population over 1,000,000, the siren and lamp or lamps shall be in operation only when it is reasonably necessary to warn pedestrians and other drivers of the approach thereof while responding to an emergency call or transporting a patient who presents a combination of circumstances resulting in a need for immediate medical intervention;
        4. Whenever the ambulance or rescue vehicle is

    (b) Except as otherwise provided in this Section, it is unlawful for any person to drive or operate a non-highway vehicle upon any street, highway, or roadway in this State. If the operation of a non-highway vehicle is authorized under subsection (d), the non-highway vehicle may be operated only on streets where the posted speed limit is 35 miles per hour or less. This subsection (b) does not prohibit a non-highway vehicle from crossing a road or street at an intersection where the road or street has a posted speed limit of more than 35 miles per hour.
    (b-5) A person may not operate a non-highway vehicle upon any street, highway, or roadway in this State unless he or she has a valid driver's license issued in his or her name by the Secretary of State or by a foreign jurisdiction.
    (c) No person operating a non-highway vehicle shall make a direct crossing upon or across any tollroad, interstate highway, or controlled access highway in this State. No person operating a non-highway vehicle shall make a direct crossing upon or across any other highway under the jurisdiction of the State except at an intersection of the highway with another public street, road, or highway.
    (c-5) (Blank).
    (d) A municipality, township, county, or other unit of local government may authorize, by ordinance or resolution, the operation of non-highway vehicles on roadways under its jurisdiction if the unit of local government determines that the public safety will not be jeopardized. The Department may authorize the operation of non-highway vehicles on the roadways under its jurisdiction if the Department determines that the public safety will not be jeopardized. The unit of local government or the Department may restrict the types of non-highway vehicles that are authorized to be used on its streets.
    Before permitting the operation of non-highway vehicles on its roadways, a municipality, township, county, other unit of local government, or the Department must consider the volume, speed, and character of traffic on the roadway and determine whether non-highway vehicles may safely travel on or cross the roadway. Upon determining that non-highway vehicles may safely operate on a roadway and the adoption of an ordinance or resolution by a municipality, township, county, or other unit of local government, or authorization by the Department, appropriate signs shall be posted.
    If a roadway is under the jurisdiction of more than one unit of government, non-highway vehicles may not be operated on the roadway unless each unit of government agrees and takes action as provided in this subsection.
    (e) No non-highway vehicle may be operated on a roadway unless, at a minimum, it has the following: brakes, a steering apparatus, tires, a rearview mirror, red reflectorized warning devices in the front and rear, a slow moving emblem (as required of other vehicles in Section 12-709 of this Code) on the rear of the non-highway vehicle, a headlight that emits a white light visible from a distance of 500 feet to the front, a tail lamp that emits a red light visible from at least 100 feet from the rear, brake lights, and turn signals.

    (f) A person who drives or is in actual physical control of a non-highway vehicle on a roadway while under the influence is subject to Sections 11-500 through 11-502 of this Code.
    (g) Any person who operates a non-highway vehicle on a street, highway, or roadway shall be subject to the mandatory insurance requirements under Article VI of Chapter 7 of this Code.
    (h) It shall not be unlawful for any person to drive or operate a non-highway vehicle, as defined in paragraphs (1) and (4) of subsection (a) of this Section, on a county roadway or township roadway for the purpose of conducting farming operations to and from the home, farm, farm buildings, and any adjacent or nearby farm land.
    Non-highway vehicles, as used in this subsection (h), shall not be subject to subsections (e) and (g) of this Section. However, if the non-highway vehicle, as used in this Section, is not covered under a motor vehicle insurance policy pursuant to subsection (g) of this Section, the vehicle must be covered under a farm, home, or non-highway vehicle insurance policy issued with coverage amounts no less than the minimum amounts set for bodily injury or death and for destruction of property under Section 7-203 of this Code. Non-highway vehicles operated on a county or township roadway at any time between one-half hour before sunset and one-half hour after sunrise must be equipped with head lamps and tail lamps, and the head lamps and tail lamps must be lighted.

    Non-highway vehicles, as used in this subsection (h), shall be allowed to cross a State highway, municipal street, county highway, or road district highway if the operator of the non-highway vehicle makes a direct crossing provided:
        (1) the crossing is made at an angle of approximately
    	
90 degrees to the direction of the street, road or highway and at a place where no obstruction prevents a quick and safe crossing;
        (2) the non-highway vehicle is brought to a complete
    	
stop before attempting a crossing;
        (3) the operator of the non-highway vehicle yields
    	
the right of way to all pedestrian and vehicular traffic which constitutes a hazard; and
        (4) that when crossing a divided highway, the
    	
crossing is made only at an intersection of the highway with another public street, road, or highway.
    (i) No action taken by a unit of local government under this Section designates the operation of a non-highway vehicle as an intended or permitted use of property with respect to Section 3-102 of the Local Governmental and Governmental Employees Tort Immunity Act.

    Sec. 11-1427. Illegal operation of an all-terrain vehicle or off-highway motorcycle. It is unlawful for any person to drive or operate any all-terrain vehicle or off-highway motorcycle in the following ways:
    (a) Careless Operation. No person shall operate any all-terrain vehicle or off-highway motorcycle in a careless or heedless manner so as to be grossly indifferent to the person or property of other persons, or at a rate of speed greater than will permit him in the exercise of reasonable care to bring the all-terrain vehicle or off-highway motorcycle to a stop within the assured clear distance ahead.
    (b) Reckless Operation. No person shall operate any all-terrain vehicle or off-highway motorcycle in such a manner as to endanger the life, limb or property of any person.
    (c) Within any nature preserve as defined in Section 3.11 of the Illinois Natural Areas Preservation Act.
    (d) On the tracks or right of way of an operating railroad.
    (e) In any tree nursery or planting in a manner which damages or destroys growing stock, or creates a substantial risk thereto.
    (f) On private property, without the written or verbal consent of the owner or lessee thereof. Any person operating an all-terrain vehicle or off-highway motorcycle upon lands of another shall stop and identify himself upon the request of the landowner or his duly authorized representative, and, if requested to do so by the landowner shall promptly remove the all-terrain vehicle or off-highway motorcycle from the premises.
    (g) Notwithstanding any other law to the contrary, an owner, lessee, or occupant of premises owes no duty of care to keep the premises safe for entry or use by others for use by an all-terrain vehicle or off-highway motorcycle, or to give warning of any condition, use, structure or activity on such premises. This subsection does not apply where permission to drive or operate an all-terrain vehicle or off-highway motorcycle is given for a valuable consideration other than to this State, any political subdivision or municipality of this State, or any landowner who is paid with funds from the Off-Highway Vehicle Trails Fund. In the case of land leased to the State or a subdivision of the State, any consideration received is not valuable consideration within the meaning of this Section.
    Nothing in this subsection limits in any way liability which otherwise exists for willful or malicious failure to guard or warn against a dangerous condition, use, structure, or activity.
    (h) On publicly owned lands unless such lands are designated for use by all-terrain vehicles or off-highway motorcycles. For publicly owned lands to be designated for use by all-terrain vehicles or off-highway motorcycles a public hearing shall be conducted by the governmental entity that has jurisdiction over the proposed land prior to the designation.
    Nothing in this subsection limits in any way liability which otherwise exists for willful or malicious failure to guard or warn against a dangerous condition, use, structure, or activity.
    (h-1) At a rate of speed too fast for conditions, and the fact that the speed of the all-terrain vehicle or off-highway motorcycle does not exceed the applicable maximum speed limit allowed does not relieve the driver from the duty to decrease speed as may be necessary to avoid colliding with any person, vehicle, or object within legal requirements and the duty of all persons to use due care.
    (h-2) On the frozen surface of public waters of this State within 100 feet of a person, including a skater, not in or upon an all-terrain vehicle or off-highway motorcycle; within 100 feet of a person engaged in fishing, except at the minimum speed required to maintain forward movement of the all-terrain vehicle or off-highway motorcycle; on an area which has been cleared of snow for skating purposes unless the area is necessary for access to the frozen waters of this State.
    (h-3) Within 100 feet of a dwelling between midnight and 6 a.m. at a speed greater than the minimum required to maintain forward movement of the all-terrain vehicle or off-highway motorcycle. This subdivision (h-5) does not apply on private property where verbal or written consent of the owner or lessee has been granted to drive or operate an all-terrain vehicle or off-highway motorcycle upon the private property or frozen waters of this State.
    (i) Other Prohibitions.
        (1) No person, except persons permitted by law, shall
    	
operate or ride any all-terrain vehicle or off-highway motorcycle with any firearm in his or her possession unless he or she is in compliance with Section 2.33 of the Wildlife Code.
        (2) No person shall operate any all-terrain vehicle
    	
or off-highway motorcycle emitting pollutants in violation of standards established pursuant to the Environmental Protection Act.
        (3) No person shall deposit from an all-terrain
    	
vehicle or off-highway motorcycle on the snow, ice or ground surface, trash, glass, garbage, insoluble material, or other offensive matter.

    (a) When operated upon any highway in this State, every motorcycle shall at all times exhibit at least one lighted lamp, showing a white light visible for at least 500 feet in the direction the motorcycle is proceeding. However, in lieu of such lighted lamp, a motorcycle may be equipped with and use a means of modulating the upper beam of the head lamp between high and a lower brightness. No such head lamp shall be modulated, except to otherwise comply with this Code, during times when lighted lamps are required for other motor vehicles.
    (b) All other motor vehicles shall exhibit at least 2 lighted head lamps, with at least one on each side of the front of the vehicle, which satisfy United States Department of Transportation requirements, showing white lights, including that emitted by high intensity discharge (HID) lamps, or lights of a yellow or amber tint, during the period from sunset to sunrise, at times when rain, snow, fog, or other atmospheric conditions require the use of windshield wipers, and at any other times when, due to insufficient light or unfavorable atmospheric conditions, persons and vehicles on the highway are not clearly discernible at a distance of 1000 feet. Parking lamps may be used in addition to but not in lieu of such head lamps. Every motor vehicle, trailer, or semi-trailer shall also exhibit at least 2 lighted lamps, commonly known as tail lamps, which shall be mounted on the left rear and right rear of the vehicle so as to throw a red light visible for at least 500 feet in the reverse direction, except that a truck tractor or road tractor manufactured before January 1, 1968 and all motorcycles need be equipped with only one such tail lamp.
    (c) Either a tail lamp or a separate lamp shall be so constructed and placed as to illuminate with a white light a rear registration plate when required and render it clearly legible from a distance of 50 feet to the rear. Any tail lamp or tail lamps, together with any separate lamp or lamps for illuminating a rear registration plate, shall be so wired as to be lighted whenever the head lamps or auxiliary driving lamps are lighted.
    (d) A person shall install only head lamps that satisfy United States Department of Transportation regulations and show white light, including that emitted by HID lamps, or light of a yellow or amber tint for use by a motor vehicle.

    (a) No school bus, first division vehicle including a taxi which is used for a purpose that requires a school bus driver permit, commuter van or motor vehicle owned by or used for hire by and in connection with the operation of private or public schools, day camps, summer camps or nursery schools, and no commuter van or passenger car used for a for-profit ridesharing arrangement, shall be operated for such purposes unless the owner thereof shall carry a minimum of personal injury liability insurance in the amount of $25,000 for any one person in any one accident, and subject to the limit for one person, $100,000 for two or more persons injured by reason of the operation of the vehicle in any one accident. This subsection (a) applies only to personal injury liability policies issued or renewed before January 1, 2013.
    (b) Liability insurance policies issued or renewed on and after January 1, 2013 shall comply with the following:
        (1) except as provided in subparagraph (2) of this
    	
subsection (b), any vehicle that is used for a purpose that requires a school bus driver permit under Section 6-104 of this Code shall carry a minimum of liability insurance in the amount of $2,000,000. This minimum insurance requirement may be satisfied by either (i) a $2,000,000 combined single limit primary commercial automobile policy; or (ii) a $1 million primary commercial automobile policy and a minimum $5,000,000 excess or umbrella liability policy;
        (2) any vehicle that is used for a purpose that

    (c) Primary insurance coverage under the provisions of this Section must be provided by a licensed and admitted insurance carrier or an intergovernmental cooperative formed under Section 10 of Article VII of the Illinois Constitution, or Section 6 or 9 of the Intergovernmental Cooperation Act, or provided by a certified self-insurer under Section 7-502 of this Code. The excess or umbrella liability coverage requirement may be met by securing surplus line insurance as defined under Section 445 of the Illinois Insurance Code. If the excess or umbrella liability coverage requirement is met by securing surplus line insurance, that coverage must be effected through a licensed surplus line producer acting under the surplus line insurance laws and regulations of this State. Nothing in this subsection (c) shall be construed as prohibiting a licensed and admitted insurance carrier or an intergovernmental cooperative formed under Section 10 of Article VII of the Illinois Constitution, or Section 6 or 9 of the Intergovernmental Cooperation Act, or a certified self-insurer under Section 7-502 of this Code, from retaining the risk required under paragraphs (1) and (2) of subsection (b) of this Section or issuing a single primary policy meeting the requirements of paragraphs (1) and (2) of subsection (b).
    (d) Each owner of a vehicle required to obtain the minimum liability requirements under subsection (b) of this Section shall attest that the vehicle meets the minimum insurance requirements under this Section. The Secretary of State shall create a form for each owner of a vehicle to attest that the owner meets the minimum insurance requirements and the owner of the vehicle shall submit the form with each registration application. The form shall be valid for the full registration period; however, if at any time the Secretary has reason to believe that the owner does not have the minimum required amount of insurance for a vehicle, then the Secretary may require a certificate of insurance, or its equivalent, to ensure the vehicle is insured. If the owner fails to produce a certificate of insurance, or its equivalent, within 2 calendar days after the request was made, then the Secretary may revoke the vehicle owner's registration until the Secretary is assured the vehicle meets the minimum insurance requirements. If the owner of a vehicle participates in an intergovernmental cooperative or is self-insured, then the owner shall attest that the insurance required under this Section is equivalent to or greater than the insurance required under paragraph (1) of subsection (b) of this Section. The Secretary may adopt any rules necessary to enforce the provisions of this subsection (d).

    Sec. 12-710. Rear fender splash guards. It is unlawful for any person to operate any vehicle of the second division, except a truck tractor, to which this Section is applicable upon any highway of this State unless such vehicle is equipped with rear fender splash guards of either the contour type or the flap type which comply with the specifications provided in this Section for the type of splash guards used on the vehicle, and which are so attached as to prevent the splashing of mud or water upon the windshield of other motor vehicles.
    (a) Specifications for contour type splash guards. When contour type rear fender splash guards are used, they shall contour the wheel in such a manner that the relationship of the inside surface of any such splash guard to the tread surface of the tire or wheel shall be relatively parallel, both laterally and across the wheel, at least throughout the top 90 degrees of the rear 180 degrees of the wheel surface; provided however, on vehicles which have a clearance of less than 5 inches between the top of the tire or wheel and that part of the body of the vehicle directly above the tire or wheel when the vehicle is loaded to maximum legal capacity, the curved portion of the splash guard need only extend from a point directly behind the center of the rear axle and to the rear of the wheel surface upwards to within at least 2 inches of the bottom line of the body when the vehicle is loaded to maximum legal capacity. There shall be a downward extension of the curved surface which shall end not more than 12 inches from the ground when the vehicle is loaded to maximum legal capacity. This downward extension shall be part of the curved surface or attached directly to such curved surface, but it need not contour the wheel. Such contour type splash guards shall be wide enough to cover the full tread width of the tire or tires being protected and shall be installed not more than 6 inches from the tread surface of the tire or wheel when the vehicle is loaded to maximum legal capacity. The splash guard shall have a lip or flange on its outside edge to minimize side throw and splash. The lip or flange shall extend toward the center of the wheel, and shall be perpendicular to and extend not less than 2 inches below the inside or bottom surface line or plane of the guard. Such contour type splash guards may be constructed of either a rigid or flexible material, but shall be attached in such a manner that, regardless of movement either by the splash guards or the vehicle, the splash guards will retain their general parallel relationship to the tread surface of the tire or wheel under all ordinary operating conditions.
    (b) Specifications for flap type splash guards. When flap type splash guards are used, they shall be wide enough to cover the full tread width of the tire or tires being protected; shall be so installed that they extend from the underside of the vehicle in a vertical plane behind the rear wheels to within 12 inches of the ground, when the vehicle is loaded to maximum legal capacity; shall be so constructed and attached so that when the vehicle is in forward motion such splash guard will not deviate or move backward from the vertical plane by an angle of more than 30 degrees measured from the vertical plane and so that when the forward motion of the vehicle causes such splash guard to deviate from the vertical plane, the bottom of such flap type splash guard will not be more than 15 inches from the ground, when the vehicle is loaded to maximum legal capacity. Such flap type splash guard may be constructed of either a rigid or flexible material.
    (c) Exemptions. This Section shall not apply to vehicles the construction or design of which does not require such splash guards, nor to vehicles in-transit and capable only of using temporary splash guards prescribed by the Department, nor to pole trailers.

        (l) water-well boring apparatuses or rigs;
        (m) any vehicle which is owned and operated by the
    	
federal government and externally displays evidence of such ownership; and
        (n) second division vehicles registered for a gross
    	
weight of 10,000 pounds or less, except when such second division motor vehicles pull or draw a trailer, semi-trailer or pole trailer having a gross weight of or registered for a gross weight of more than 10,000 pounds; motor buses; religious organization buses; school buses; senior citizen transportation vehicles; medical transport vehicles; tow trucks; and any property carrying vehicles being operated in commerce that are registered for a gross weight of more than 8,000 lbs but less than 10,001 lbs.
    The safety test shall include the testing and inspection of brakes, lights, horns, reflectors, rear vision mirrors, mufflers, safety chains, windshields and windshield wipers, warning flags and flares, frame, axle, cab and body, or cab or body, wheels, steering apparatus, and other safety devices and appliances required by this Code and such other safety tests as the Department may by rule or regulation require, for second division vehicles, school buses, medical transport vehicles, tow trucks, first division vehicles including taxis which are used for a purpose that requires a school bus driver permit, motor vehicles used for driver education training, vehicles designed to carry 15 or fewer passengers operated by a contract carrier transporting employees in the course of their employment on a highway of this State, trailers, and semitrailers subject to inspection.
    For tow trucks, the safety test and inspection shall also include the inspection of winch mountings, body panels, body mounts, wheel lift swivel points, and sling straps, and other tests and inspections the Department by rule requires for tow trucks.
    For driver education vehicles used by public high schools, the vehicle must also be equipped with dual control brakes, a mirror on each side of the vehicle so located as to reflect to the driver a view of the highway for a distance of at least 200 feet to the rear, and a sign visible from the front and the rear identifying the vehicle as a driver education car.
    For trucks, truck tractors, trailers, semi-trailers, buses, and first division vehicles including taxis which are used for a purpose that requires a school bus driver permit, the safety test shall be conducted in accordance with the Minimum Periodic Inspection Standards promulgated by the Federal Highway Administration of the U.S. Department of Transportation and contained in Appendix G to Subchapter B of Chapter III of Title 49 of the Code of Federal Regulations. Those standards, as now in effect, are made a part of this Code, in the same manner as though they were set out in full in this Code.
    The passing of the safety test shall not be a bar at any time to prosecution for operating a second division vehicle, medical transport vehicle, motor vehicle used for driver education training, or vehicle designed to carry 15 or fewer passengers operated by a contract carrier as provided in this Section that is unsafe, as determined by the standards prescribed in this Code.

Tests shall be conducted at an official testing station within 6 months prior to the application for registration as provided for in this Code. Subsequently each vehicle shall be subject to tests (i) at least every 6 months, (ii) in the case of school buses and first division vehicles including taxis which are used for a purpose that requires a school bus driver permit, at least every 6 months or 10,000 miles, whichever occurs first, (iii) in the case of driver education vehicles used by public high schools, at least every 12 months for vehicles over 5 model years of age or having an odometer reading of over 75,000 miles, whichever occurs first, or (iv) in the case of truck tractors, semitrailers, and property-carrying vehicles registered for a gross weight of more than 10,000 pounds but less than 26,001 pounds, at least every 12 months, and according to schedules established by rules and regulations promulgated by the Department. Any component subject to regular inspection which is damaged in a reportable accident must be reinspected before the bus or first division vehicle including a taxi which is used for a purpose that requires a school bus driver permit is returned to service.
    (b) The Department shall also conduct periodic nonscheduled inspections of school buses, of buses registered as charitable vehicles and of religious organization buses. If such inspection reveals that a vehicle is not in substantial compliance with the rules promulgated by the Department, the Department shall remove the Certificate of Safety from the vehicle, and shall place the vehicle out-of-service. A bright orange, triangular decal shall be placed on an out-of-service vehicle where the Certificate of Safety has been removed. The vehicle must pass a safety test at an official testing station before it is again placed in service.
    (c) If the violation is not substantial a bright yellow, triangular sticker shall be placed next to the Certificate of Safety at the time the nonscheduled inspection is made. The Department shall reinspect the vehicle after 3 working days to determine that the violation has been corrected and remove the yellow, triangular decal. If the violation is not corrected within 3 working days, the Department shall place the vehicle out-of-service in accordance with procedures in subsection (b).
    (d) If a violation is not substantial and does not directly affect the safe operation of the vehicle, the Department shall issue a warning notice requiring correction of the violation. Such correction shall be accomplished as soon as practicable and a report of the correction shall be made to the Department within 30 days in a manner established by the Department. If the Department has not been advised that the corrections have been made, and the violations still exist, the Department shall place the vehicle out-of-service in accordance with procedures in subsection (b).
    (e) The Department is authorized to promulgate regulations to implement its program of nonscheduled inspections. Causing or allowing the operation of an out-of-service vehicle with passengers or unauthorized removal of an out-of-service sticker is a Class 3 felony. Causing or allowing the operation of a vehicle with a 3-day sticker for longer than 3 days with the sticker attached or the unauthorized removal of a 3-day sticker is a Class C misdemeanor.
    (f) If a second division vehicle, first division vehicle including a taxi which is used for a purpose that requires a school bus driver permit, medical transport vehicle, or vehicle operated by a contract carrier as provided in subsection (a) of this Section is in safe mechanical condition, as determined pursuant to Chapter 13, the operator of the official testing station must at once issue to the second division vehicle, first division vehicle including a taxi which is used for a purpose that requires a school bus driver permit, or medical transport vehicle a certificate of safety, in the form and manner prescribed by the Department, which shall be affixed to the vehicle by the certified safety tester who performed the safety tests. The owner of the second division vehicle, first division vehicle including a taxi which is used for a purpose that requires a school bus driver permit, or medical transport vehicle or the contract carrier shall at all times display the Certificate of Safety on the second division vehicle, first division vehicle including a taxi which is used for a purpose that requires a school bus driver permit, medical transport vehicle, or vehicle operated by a contract carrier in the manner prescribed by the Department.
    (g) If a test shows that a second division vehicle, first division vehicle including a taxi which is used for a purpose that requires a school bus driver permit, medical transport vehicle, or vehicle operated by a contract carrier is not in safe mechanical condition as provided in this Section, it shall not be operated on the highways until it has been repaired and submitted to a retest at an official testing station. If the owner or contract carrier submits the vehicle to a retest at a different official testing station from that where it failed to pass the first test, he or she shall present to the operator of the second station the report of the original test, and shall notify the Department in writing, giving the name and address of the original testing station and the defects which prevented the issuance of a Certificate of Safety, and the name and address of the second official testing station making the retest.

Those procedures and standards, as now in effect, are made a part of this Code, in the same manner as though they were set out in full in this Code.
    Notwithstanding the above cutpoint standards, for motor vehicles that are model years 1973 and older, until December 31, 2002, the level of peak smoke opacity shall not exceed 70 percent. Beginning January 1, 2003, for motor vehicles that are model years 1973 and older, the level of peak smoke opacity shall not exceed 55 percent.
    (c) If the annual emission inspection under subsection (a) reveals that the vehicle is not in compliance with the diesel emission standards set forth in subsection (b) of this Section, the operator of the official testing station shall issue a warning notice requiring correction of the violation. The correction shall be made and the vehicle submitted to an emissions retest at an official testing station certified by the Department to perform diesel emission inspections within 30 days from the issuance of the warning notice requiring correction of the violation.
    If, within 30 days from the issuance of the warning notice, the vehicle is not in compliance with the diesel emission standards set forth in subsection (b) as determined by an emissions retest at an official testing station, the operator of the official testing station or the Department shall place the vehicle out-of-service in accordance with the rules promulgated by the Department. Operating a vehicle that has been placed out-of-service under this subsection (c) is a petty offense punishable by a $1,000 fine. The vehicle must pass a diesel emission inspection at an official testing station before it is again placed in service. The Secretary of State, Department of State Police, and other law enforcement officers shall enforce this Section. No emergency vehicle, as defined in Section 1-105, may be placed out-of-service pursuant to this Section.
    The Department or an official testing station may issue a certificate of waiver subsequent to a reinspection of a vehicle that failed the emissions inspection. Certificate of waiver shall be issued upon determination that documented proof demonstrates that emissions repair costs for the noncompliant vehicle of at least $3,000 have been spent in an effort to achieve compliance with the emission standards set forth in subsection (b). The Department of Transportation shall adopt rules for the implementation of this subsection including standards of documented proof as well as the criteria by which a waiver shall be granted.

    (a) Computer-Matched Inspections and Notification.
        (1) The provisions of this subsection (a) are
    	
operative until the implementation of the registration denial inspection and notification mechanisms required by subsection (b). Beginning with the implementation of the program required by this Chapter, every motor vehicle that is owned by a resident of an affected county, other than a vehicle that is exempt under paragraph (a)(6) or (a)(7), is subject to inspection under the program.
        The Agency shall send notice of the assigned
    	
inspection month, at least 15 days before the beginning of the assigned month, to the owner of each vehicle subject to the program. An initial emission inspection sticker or initial inspection certificate, as the case may be, expires on the last day of the third month following the month assigned by the Agency for the first inspection of the vehicle. A renewal inspection sticker or certificate expires on the last day of the third month following the month assigned for inspection in the year in which the vehicle's next inspection is required.
        The Agency or its agent may issue an interim emission
    	
inspection sticker or certificate for any vehicle subject to inspection that does not have a currently valid emission inspection sticker or certificate at the time the Agency is notified by the Secretary of State of its registration by a new owner, and for which an initial emission inspection sticker or certificate has already been issued. An interim emission inspection sticker or certificate expires no later than the last day of the sixth complete calendar month after the date the Agency issued the interim emission inspection sticker or certificate.
        The owner of each vehicle subject to inspection shall
    	
obtain an emission inspection sticker or certificate for the vehicle in accordance with this paragraph (1). Before the expiration of the emission inspection sticker or certificate, the owner shall have the vehicle inspected and, upon demonstration of compliance, obtain a renewal emission inspection sticker or certificate. A renewal emission inspection sticker or certificate shall not be issued more than 5 months before the expiration date of the previous inspection sticker or certificate.
        (2) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(3), vehicles
    	
shall be inspected every 2 years on a schedule that begins either in the second, fourth, or later calendar year after the vehicle model year. The beginning test schedule shall be set by the Agency and shall be consistent with the State's requirements for emission reductions as determined by the applicable United States Environmental Protection Agency vehicle emissions estimation model and applicable guidance and rules.

In any such program, the Agency shall evaluate the emission performance of 0.5% of the subject fleet or 20,000 vehicles, whichever is less. Under no circumstances shall on-road testing include any sort of roadblock or roadside pullover or cause any type of traffic delay. If, during the course of an on-road inspection, a vehicle is found to exceed the on-road emissions standards established for the model year and type of vehicle, the Agency shall send a notice to the vehicle owner. The notice shall document the occurrence and the results of the on-road exceedance. The notice of a second on-road exceedance shall indicate that the vehicle has been reassigned and is subject to an out-of-cycle follow-up inspection at an official inspection station. In no case shall the Agency send a notice of an on-road exceedance to the owner of a vehicle that was found to exceed the on-road emission standards established for the model year and type of vehicle, if the vehicle is registered outside of the affected counties.
    (b) Registration Denial Inspection and Notification.
        (1) No later than January 1, 2008, every motor
    	
vehicle that is owned by a resident of an affected county, other than a vehicle that is exempt under paragraph (b)(8) or (b)(9), is subject to inspection under the program.
        The owner of a vehicle subject to inspection shall
    	
have the vehicle inspected and obtain proof of compliance from the Agency in order to obtain or renew a vehicle registration for a subject vehicle.
        The Secretary of State shall notify the owner of a

Notwithstanding the preceding, vehicles with permanent registration plates shall be notified at least 30 days prior to the month corresponding to the date the vehicle was originally registered. This notification shall clearly state the vehicle's test status, based upon the vehicle type, model year and registration address.
        The owner of each vehicle subject to inspection shall
    	
have the vehicle inspected and, upon demonstration of compliance, obtain an emissions compliance certificate for the vehicle.
        (2) Except as provided in paragraphs (b)(3), (b)(4),
    	
and (b)(5), vehicles shall be inspected every 2 years on a schedule that begins in the fourth calendar year after the vehicle model year. Even model year vehicles shall be inspected and comply in order to renew registrations expiring in even calendar years and odd model year vehicles shall be inspected and comply in order to renew registrations expiring in odd calendar years.
        (3) A vehicle shall be inspected and comply at a time
    	
outside of its normal 2-year inspection schedule if (i) the vehicle was acquired by a new owner and (ii) the vehicle had not been issued a Compliance Certificate within one year of the date of application for the title or registration, or both, for the vehicle.
        (4) Vehicles with 2-year registrations shall be

    Sec. 13C-20. Rules and standards.
    (a) The rules and emission standards adopted under subsection (a) of Section 13B-20 of this Code shall apply to the program established under this Chapter and continue in effect until amended or repealed by the Board under this subsection.
    The Agency shall propose any other standards necessary to achieve reductions in the emission of hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, and oxides of nitrogen from motor vehicles subject to inspection under this Chapter. Within 120 days after the Agency proposes those standards, the Board shall adopt any necessary rules establishing standards for the emission of hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, and oxides of nitrogen from motor vehicles subject to inspection under this Chapter. The rules may be amended from time to time pursuant to Agency proposals. The Board shall set standards necessary to achieve the reductions in vehicle hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, and oxides of nitrogen emissions, as determined by the applicable vehicle emission estimation model and rules developed by the United States Environmental Protection Agency, that are required by the federal Clean Air Act. A predetermined rate of failure shall not be used in determining standards necessary to achieve the reductions in vehicle hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, and oxides of nitrogen emissions. The emission standards established by the Board for vehicles of model year 1981 or later shall be identical in substance, as defined in Section 7.2(a) of the Environmental Protection Act, to the emission standards promulgated by the United States Environmental Protection Agency.
    Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, subsection (b) of Section 27 of the Environmental Protection Act and the rulemaking provisions of the Illinois Administrative Procedure Act do not apply to rules adopted by the Board under this subsection. Challenges to the validity of rules adopted by the Board under this subsection or subsection (a) of Section 13B-20 may be brought only by filing a petition for review in the Appellate Court under Section 29 of the Environmental Protection Act within 35 days after the rule is filed with the Secretary of State.
    (b) The procedures established by the Agency under subsection (b) of Section 13B-20 of this Code shall apply to the program established under this Chapter and remain in effect until amended or repealed under this subsection.

    (a) Except as provided in subsection (b), the inspection of vehicles required under this Chapter shall be performed only: (i) by inspectors who have been certified by the Agency after successfully completing a course of training and successfully passing a written test; (ii) at official inspection stations, including on-road inspection sites established under this Chapter; and (iii) with equipment that has been approved by the Agency for these inspections.
    (b) The requirements of subdivisions (a)(i) and (a)(ii) of this Section do not preclude the performance of inspections (1) at self-service official inspection stations, (2) using Agency-approved wireless communication interfaces, and (3) using systems designed to perform remote on-board diagnostic inspections.
    (c) Except as provided in subsection (h), the inspection shall consist of an on-board diagnostic system test. The owner of the vehicle or the owner's agent shall be entitled to an emission inspection certificate issued by the Agency only if all required tests are passed at the time of the inspection.
    (d) (Blank).
    (e) (Blank).
    (f) (Blank).
    (g) The on-board diagnostic system test shall consist of accessing the vehicle's on-board computer system, determining the vehicle's readiness status and MIL status, and retrieving any stored diagnostic codes that may be present. The vehicle shall be deemed to have passed this test if the vehicle readiness status indicates that the vehicle's OBD system has completed all required system and component checks, the MIL status is appropriate, and the diagnostic codes retrieved do not exceed standards set for vehicles of that type under Section 13C-20.
    (h) A visual inspection test of the MIL may be substituted for the on-board diagnostic system test on any vehicle for which on-board diagnostic testing is not possible due to the vehicle's originally certified design or its design as modified in accordance with federal law and regulations, and on any vehicle with known on-board diagnostic communications or software problems, as determined by the Agency. The visual inspection test shall consist of verifying the status of the MIL in the key-on/engine off position and the key-on/engine on position. The vehicle shall be deemed to have passed this test if the MIL illuminates briefly during the key-on/engine off position and does not illuminate during the key-on/engine on position.

    Sec. 13C-30. Waivers.
    (a) The Agency shall certify that a vehicle that has failed a vehicle emission retest qualifies for a waiver of the emission inspection standards if all of the following criteria are met:
        (1) The vehicle has received all repairs and
    	
adjustments for which it is eligible under any emission performance warranty provided under Section 207 of the federal Clean Air Act.
        (2) The Agency determines by normal inspection
    	
procedures that the vehicle's emission control devices are present and appear to be properly connected and operating.
        (3) Consistent with Title 40, Section 51.360 of the
    	
Code of Federal Regulations, for vehicles required to be tested under this Chapter, an expenditure of at least $450 in emission-related repairs (but exclusive of any repairs related to tampering) has been made.
        (4) For a vehicle of model year 1981 or later, the
    	
repairs were performed by a recognized repair technician.
        (5) Evidence of repair is presented, consisting of
    	
either (i) signed and dated receipts identifying the vehicle and describing the work performed and the amount charged for the eligible emission-related repairs or (ii) an affidavit executed by the person performing the eligible emission-related repairs.
    (b) The Agency may issue an emission inspection certificate to a vehicle failing a retest if a complete documented physical and functional diagnosis and inspection shows that no additional emission-related repairs are needed. This diagnostic inspection must be performed by the Agency or its designated agent and shall be available only to a vehicle owner whose vehicle was repaired by a recognized repair technician.
    (c) The Agency may extend the emission inspection certificate expiration date by one year upon receipt of a petition by the vehicle owner that needed repairs cannot be made due to economic hardship. Consistent with Title 40, Section 51.360 of the Code of Federal Regulations, this extension may be granted more than once during the life of the vehicle.
    (d) The Agency may issue an emission inspection certificate for a vehicle subject to inspection under this Chapter that is located and primarily used in an area subject to the vehicle inspection requirements of another state. An emission inspection certificate shall be issued under this subsection only upon receipt by the Agency of evidence that the vehicle has been inspected and is in compliance with the emission inspection requirements and standards applicable in the state or local jurisdiction where the vehicle is being used.

The written determination shall include a statement of the facts relied upon and the legal and technical issues decided by the Agency in making its determination, and may also include an order directing the inspector (i) to issue an emission inspection certificate for the vehicle effective on such date as the Agency may specify, (ii) to reinspect the vehicle, (iii) to apply the standards that the Agency has determined to be applicable, or (iv) to take any other action that the Agency deems to be appropriate. In conducting the investigation, the Agency may require the petitioner to present the vehicle for inspection by the Agency or its designated agent.
        (2) The written determination of the Agency shall be
    	
subject to review in circuit court in accordance with the provisions of the Administrative Review Law, except that no challenge to the validity of a rule adopted or continued under subsection (a) of Section 13C-20 shall be heard by the circuit court if the challenge could have been raised in a timely petition for review as provided in Section 13C-20.
    (b) Vehicle damage claim requirements and procedures.
        (1) The contractor shall make vehicle damage claim
    	
forms authorized by the Agency available for vehicle owners in sufficient quantities at all official inspection stations.
        (2) Notice of the vehicle damage claim procedures and
    	
the vehicle owner's rights in relation to a vehicle damage claim shall be conspicuously posted at all official inspection stations.
        (3) If a vehicle owner believes that his or her
    	
vehicle was damaged by an act or omission of the contractor during or as a result of an emissions inspection performed on or after August 1, 2002, the owner may initiate resolution of the damage claim under this subsection by complying with the following:
            (A) Within 30 days of the date of the vehicle
        	
emissions inspection that allegedly caused the vehicle damage, the vehicle owner shall submit a vehicle damage claim to the contractor at the official inspection station at which the vehicle damage allegedly occurred.
            (B) Within 30 days of filing the claim, the owner
        	
shall submit to the contractor any relevant information relating to the owner's claim for vehicle damage, including but not limited to evaluations conducted by a claims evaluation center or automotive repair shop meeting standards prescribed by the Agency.
        (4) The contractor shall promptly notify the Agency
    	
of each vehicle damage claim received by the contractor under subdivision (b)(3) and shall forward to the Agency any additional information provided by the owner.
        (5) Within 60 days after the filing of a vehicle
    	
damage claim, the contractor shall notify the vehicle owner of its proposed resolution of the damage claim.
        (6) Within 30 days after receiving the contractor's
    	
proposed resolution of the damage claim, the owner may petition the Agency for a review of the adequacy and completeness of the contractor's proposed resolution. The petition shall be in a form specified by the Agency.
        (7) Upon receiving a petition for review, the Agency
    	
shall request the contractor to deliver to the Agency a copy of the contractor's proposed resolution of the damage claim, together with all documents, videotapes, and information relevant to the damage claim and the proposed resolution. The contractor shall provide the requested materials to the Agency within 15 days of receiving the Agency's request.
        (8) Within 30 days after receiving the relevant
    	
materials from the contractor, the Agency shall review the materials and determine whether the contractor's proposed resolution of the damage claim is adequate and complete. The Agency may deem the proposed resolution of the damage claim to be adequate and complete. If the Agency does not deem the proposed resolution of the damage claim to be adequate and complete, it may request the contractor to further investigate and evaluate the damage claim and resubmit its proposed resolution of the claim. The contractor shall then have 30 days to respond in writing to the Agency with the results of its further evaluation of the damage claim and its proposed resolution.
        (9) The Agency shall notify the vehicle owner in
    	
writing of the result of its review of the adequacy and completeness of the contractor's proposed resolution of the damage claim. Copies of all correspondence between the Agency and the contractor relating to the damage claim shall also be sent to the vehicle owner.
        (10) If, after the Agency's review, the vehicle owner
    	
still does not agree with all or a portion of the proposed resolution of the damage claim by the contractor, the vehicle owner may further pursue the damage claim through the binding arbitration process established by the contractor and accepted by the Agency, or in circuit court.
        (11) The Agency's review of the adequacy and
    	
completeness of the contractor's proposed resolution of a damage claim is not binding upon the vehicle owner or the contractor and does not affect the rights of the vehicle owner or the contractor under law. The Agency's review of the adequacy and completeness of the contractor's proposed resolution of a damage claim is not a final action subject to administrative review and is not subject to review by the Pollution Control Board or otherwise appealable.

a waiver;
            (D) A commitment to routinely issue citations to
        	
motorists with expired or missing license plates, with either no registration or an expired registration, and with no license plate decals or expired decals, and provide for enforcement officials other than police to issue citations (e.g., parking meter attendants) to parked vehicles in noncompliance;
            (E) A commitment to structure the penalty system
        	
to deter noncompliance with the registration requirement through the use of mandatory minimum fines (meaning civil, monetary penalties) constituting a meaningful deterrent and through a requirement that compliance be demonstrated before a case can be closed;
            (F) Ensurance that evidence of testing is
        	
available and checked for validity at the time of a new registration of a used vehicle or registration renewal;
            (G) Prevention of owners or lessors from avoiding
        	
testing through manipulation of the title or registration system; title transfers may re-start the clock on the inspection cycle only if proof of current compliance is required at title transfer;
            (H) Prevention of the fraudulent initial
        	
classification or reclassification of a vehicle from subject to non-subject or exempt by requiring proof of address changes prior to registration record modification, and documentation from the testing program (or delegate) certifying based on a physical inspection that the vehicle is exempt;
            (I) Limiting and tracking of the use of time
        	
extensions of the registration requirement to prevent repeated extensions;
            (J) Providing for meaningful penalties for cases
        	
of registration fraud;
            (K) Limiting and tracking exemptions to prevent
        	
abuse of the exemption policy for vehicles claimed to be out-of-state; and
            (L) Encouraging enforcement of vehicle
        	
registration transfer requirements when vehicle owners move into the affected counties by coordinating with local and State enforcement agencies and structuring other activities (e.g., driver's license issuance) to effect registration transfers.
        (2) The Agency shall cooperate in the enforcement of
    	
this Chapter by providing the owner or owners of complying vehicles with a Compliance Certificate stating that the vehicle meets all applicable requirements of this Chapter.
        The Agency shall cooperate with the Secretary of
    	
State in the administration of this Chapter and the related provisions of Chapter 3, and shall provide the Secretary of State with such information as the Secretary of State may deem necessary for these purposes, including regular and timely access to vehicle inspection records.

        (16) A bus, motor coach, or recreational vehicle may
    	
carry a total weight of 24,000 pounds on a single axle, but may not exceed other weight provisions of this Section.
    Gross weight limits shall not apply to the combination of the tow truck and vehicles being towed. The tow truck license plate must cover the operating empty weight of the tow truck only. The weight of each vehicle being towed shall be covered by a valid license plate issued to the owner or operator of the vehicle being towed and displayed on that vehicle. If no valid plate issued to the owner or operator of that vehicle is displayed on that vehicle, or the plate displayed on that vehicle does not cover the weight of the vehicle, the weight of the vehicle shall be covered by the third tow truck plate issued to the owner or operator of the tow truck and temporarily affixed to the vehicle being towed. If a roll-back carrier is registered and being used as a tow truck, however, the license plate or plates for the tow truck must cover the gross vehicle weight, including any load carried on the bed of the roll-back carrier.
    The Department may by rule or regulation prescribe additional requirements. However, nothing in this Code shall prohibit a tow truck under instructions of a police officer from legally clearing a disabled vehicle, that may be in violation of weight limitations of this Chapter, from the roadway to the berm or shoulder of the highway. If in the opinion of the police officer that location is unsafe, the officer is authorized to have the disabled vehicle towed to the nearest place of safety.
    For the purpose of this subsection, gross vehicle weight rating, or GVWR, means the value specified by the manufacturer as the loaded weight of the tow truck.
    (b) As used in this Section, "recycling haul" or "recycling operation" means the hauling of non-hazardous, non-special, non-putrescible materials, such as paper, glass, cans, or plastic, for subsequent use in the secondary materials market.
    (c) No vehicle or combination of vehicles equipped with pneumatic tires shall be operated, unladen or with load, upon the highways of this State in violation of the provisions of any permit issued under the provisions of Sections 15-301 through 15-318 of this Chapter.
    (d) No vehicle or combination of vehicles equipped with other than pneumatic tires may be operated, unladen or with load, upon the highways of this State when the gross weight on the road surface through any wheel exceeds 800 pounds per inch width of tire tread or when the gross weight on the road surface through any axle exceeds 16,000 pounds.
    (e) No person shall operate a vehicle or combination of vehicles over a bridge or other elevated structure constituting part of a highway with a gross weight that is greater than the maximum weight permitted by the Department, when the structure is sign posted as provided in this Section.
    (f) The Department upon request from any local authority shall, or upon its own initiative may, conduct an investigation of any bridge or other elevated structure constituting a part of a highway, and if it finds that the structure cannot with safety to itself withstand the weight of vehicles otherwise permissible under this Code the Department shall determine and declare the maximum weight of vehicles that the structures can withstand, and shall cause or permit suitable signs stating maximum weight to be erected and maintained before each end of the structure. No person shall operate a vehicle or combination of vehicles over any structure with a gross weight that is greater than the posted maximum weight.
    (g) Upon the trial of any person charged with a violation of subsection (e) or (f) of this Section, proof of the determination of the maximum allowable weight by the Department and the existence of the signs, constitutes conclusive evidence of the maximum weight that can be maintained with safety to the bridge or structure.

    Sec. 15-112. Officers to weigh vehicles and require removal of excess loads.
    (a) Any police officer having reason to believe that the weight of a vehicle and load is unlawful shall require the driver to stop and submit to a weighing of the same either by means of a portable or stationary scales that have been tested and approved at a frequency prescribed by the Illinois Department of Agriculture, or for those scales operated by the State, when such tests are requested by the Department of State Police, whichever is more frequent. If such scales are not available at the place where such vehicle is stopped, the police officer shall require that such vehicle be driven to the nearest available scale that has been tested and approved pursuant to this Section by the Illinois Department of Agriculture. Notwithstanding any provisions of the Weights and Measures Act or the United States Department of Commerce NIST handbook 44, multi or single draft weighing is an acceptable method of weighing by law enforcement for determining a violation of Chapter 3 or 15 of this Code. Law enforcement is exempt from the requirements of commercial weighing established in NIST handbook 44.
    Within 18 months after the effective date of this amendatory Act of the 91st General Assembly, all municipal and county officers, technicians, and employees who set up and operate portable scales for wheel load or axle load or both and issue citations based on the use of portable scales for wheel load or axle load or both and who have not successfully completed initial classroom and field training regarding the set up and operation of portable scales, shall attend and successfully complete initial classroom and field training administered by the Illinois Law Enforcement Training Standards Board.
    (b) Whenever an officer, upon weighing a vehicle and the load, determines that the weight is unlawful, such officer shall require the driver to stop the vehicle in a suitable place and remain standing until such portion of the load is removed as may be necessary to reduce the weight of the vehicle to the limit permitted under this Chapter, or to the limit permitted under the terms of a permit issued pursuant to Sections 15-301 through 15-318 and shall forthwith arrest the driver or owner. All material so unloaded shall be cared for by the owner or operator of the vehicle at the risk of such owner or operator; however, whenever a 3 or 4 axle vehicle with a tandem axle dimension greater than 72 inches, but less than 96 inches and registered as a Special Hauling Vehicle is transporting asphalt or concrete in the plastic state that exceeds axle weight or gross weight limits by less than 4,000 pounds, the owner or operator of the vehicle shall accept the arrest ticket or tickets for the alleged violations under this Section and proceed without shifting or reducing the load being transported or may shift or reduce the load under the provisions of subsection (d) or (e) of this Section, when applicable. Any fine imposed following an overweight violation by a vehicle registered as a Special Hauling Vehicle transporting asphalt or concrete in the plastic state shall be paid as provided in subsection 4 of paragraph (a) of Section 16-105 of this Code.
    (c) The Department of Transportation may, at the request of the Department of State Police, erect appropriate regulatory signs on any State highway directing second division vehicles to a scale. The Department of Transportation may also, at the direction of any State Police officer, erect portable regulating signs on any highway directing second division vehicles to a portable scale. Every such vehicle, pursuant to such sign, shall stop and be weighed.
    (d) Whenever any axle load of a vehicle exceeds the axle or tandem axle weight limits permitted by paragraph (a) of Section 15-111 by 2000 pounds or less, the owner or operator of the vehicle must shift or remove the excess so as to comply with paragraph (a) of Section 15-111. No overweight arrest ticket shall be issued to the owner or operator of the vehicle by any officer if the excess weight is shifted or removed as required by this paragraph.
    (e) Whenever the gross weight of a vehicle with a registered gross weight of 77,000 pounds or less exceeds the weight limits of paragraph (a) of Section 15-111 of this Chapter by 2000 pounds or less, the owner or operator of the vehicle must remove the excess. Whenever the gross weight of a vehicle with a registered gross weight over 77,000 pounds or more exceeds the weight limits of paragraph (a) of Section 15-111 by 1,000 pounds or less or 2,000 pounds or less if weighed on wheel load weighers, the owner or operator of the vehicle must remove the excess. In either case no arrest ticket for any overweight violation of this Code shall be issued to the owner or operator of the vehicle by any officer if the excess weight is removed as required by this paragraph. A person who has been granted a special permit under Section 15-301 of this Code shall not be granted a tolerance on wheel load weighers.
    (e-5) Auxiliary power or idle reduction unit (APU) weight.
        (1) A vehicle with a fully functional APU shall be
    	
allowed an additional 550 pounds or the certified unit weight, whichever is less. The additional pounds may be allowed in gross, axles, or bridge formula weight limits above the legal weight limits except when overweight on an axle or axles of the towed unit or units in combination. This tolerance shall be given in addition to the limits in subsection (d) of this Section.
        (2) An operator of a vehicle equipped with an APU
    	
shall carry written certification showing the weight of the APU, which shall be displayed upon the request of any law enforcement officer.
        (3) The operator may be required to demonstrate or
    	
certify that the APU is fully functional at all times.
        (4) This allowance may not be granted above the
    	
weight limits specified on any loads permitted under Section 15-301 of this Code.
    (f) Whenever an axle load of a vehicle exceeds axle weight limits allowed by the provisions of a permit an arrest ticket shall be issued, but the owner or operator of the vehicle may shift the load so as to comply with the provisions of the permit. Where such shifting of a load to comply with the permit is accomplished, the owner or operator of the vehicle may then proceed.
    (g) Any driver of a vehicle who refuses to stop and submit his vehicle and load to weighing after being directed to do so by an officer or removes or causes the removal of the load or part of it prior to weighing is guilty of a business offense and shall be fined not less than $500 nor more than $2,000.

ARTICLE III. PERMITS

    (625 ILCS 5/15-301) (from Ch. 95 1/2, par. 15-301)
    Sec. 15-301. Permits for excess size and weight.
    (a) The Department with respect to highways under its jurisdiction and local authorities with respect to highways under their jurisdiction may, in their discretion, upon application and good cause being shown therefor, issue a special permit authorizing the applicant to operate or move a vehicle or combination of vehicles of a size or weight of vehicle or load exceeding the maximum specified in this Code or otherwise not in conformity with this Code upon any highway under the jurisdiction of the party granting such permit and for the maintenance of which the party is responsible. Applications and permits other than those in written or printed form may only be accepted from and issued to the company or individual making the movement. Except for an application to move directly across a highway, it shall be the duty of the applicant to establish in the application that the load to be moved by such vehicle or combination cannot reasonably be dismantled or disassembled, the reasonableness of which shall be determined by the Secretary of the Department. For the purpose of over length movements, more than one object may be carried side by side as long as the height, width, and weight laws are not exceeded and the cause for the over length is not due to multiple objects. For the purpose of over height movements, more than one object may be carried as long as the cause for the over height is not due to multiple objects and the length, width, and weight laws are not exceeded. For the purpose of an over width movement, more than one object may be carried as long as the cause for the over width is not due to multiple objects and length, height, and weight laws are not exceeded. Except for transporting fluid milk products, no State or local agency shall authorize the issuance of excess size or weight permits for vehicles and loads that are divisible and that can be carried, when divided, within the existing size or weight maximums specified in this Chapter. Any excess size or weight permit issued in violation of the provisions of this Section shall be void at issue and any movement made thereunder shall not be authorized under the terms of the void permit. In any prosecution for a violation of this Chapter when the authorization of an excess size or weight permit is at issue, it is the burden of the defendant to establish that the permit was valid because the load to be moved could not reasonably be dismantled or disassembled, or was otherwise nondivisible.
    (a-1) As used in this Section, "extreme heavy duty tow and recovery vehicle" means a tow truck manufactured as a unit having a lifting capacity of not less than 50 tons, and having either 4 axles and an unladen weight of not more than 80,000 pounds or 5 axles and an unladen weight not more than 90,000 pounds. Notwithstanding otherwise applicable gross and axle weight limits, an extreme heavy duty tow and recovery vehicle may lawfully travel to and from the scene of a disablement and clear a disabled vehicle if the towing service has obtained an extreme heavy duty tow and recovery permit for the vehicle. The form and content of the permit shall be determined by the Department with respect to highways under its jurisdiction and by local authorities with respect to highways under their jurisdiction.
    (b) The application for any such permit shall: (1) state whether such permit is requested for a single trip or for limited continuous operation; (2) state if the applicant is an authorized carrier under the Illinois Motor Carrier of Property Law, if so, his certificate, registration, or permit number issued by the Illinois Commerce Commission; (3) specifically describe and identify the vehicle or vehicles and load to be operated or moved; (4) state the routing requested, including the points of origin and destination, and may identify and include a request for routing to the nearest certified scale in accordance with the Department's rules and regulations, provided the applicant has approval to travel on local roads; and (5) state if the vehicles or loads are being transported for hire. No permits for the movement of a vehicle or load for hire shall be issued to any applicant who is required under the Illinois Motor Carrier of Property Law to have a certificate, registration, or permit and does not have such certificate, registration, or permit.
    (c) The Department or local authority when not inconsistent with traffic safety is authorized to issue or withhold such permit at its discretion; or, if such permit is issued at its discretion to prescribe the route or routes to be traveled, to limit the number of trips, to establish seasonal or other time limitations within which the vehicles described may be operated on the highways indicated, or otherwise to limit or prescribe conditions of operations of such vehicle or vehicles, when necessary to assure against undue damage to the road foundations, surfaces or structures, and may require such undertaking or other security as may be deemed necessary to compensate for any injury to any roadway or road structure. The Department shall maintain a daily record of each permit issued along with the fee and the stipulated dimensions, weights, conditions, and restrictions authorized and this record shall be presumed correct in any case of questions or dispute. The Department shall install an automatic device for recording applications received and permits issued by telephone. In making application by telephone, the Department and applicant waive all objections to the recording of the conversation.
    (d) The Department shall, upon application in writing from any local authority, issue an annual permit authorizing the local authority to move oversize highway construction, transportation, utility, and maintenance equipment over roads under the jurisdiction of the Department. The permit shall be applicable only to equipment and vehicles owned by or registered in the name of the local authority, and no fee shall be charged for the issuance of such permits.
    (e) As an exception to subsection (a) of this Section, the Department and local authorities, with respect to highways under their respective jurisdictions, in their discretion and upon application in writing, may issue a special permit for limited continuous operation, authorizing the applicant to move loads of agricultural commodities on a 2-axle single vehicle registered by the Secretary of State with axle loads not to exceed 35%, on a 3-axle or 4-axle vehicle registered by the Secretary of State with axle loads not to exceed 20%, and on a 5-axle vehicle registered by the Secretary of State not to exceed 10% above those provided in Section 15-111. The total gross weight of the vehicle, however, may not exceed the maximum gross weight of the registration class of the vehicle allowed under Section 3-815 or 3-818 of this Code.
    As used in this Section, "agricultural commodities" means:
        (1) cultivated plants or agricultural produce grown,
    	
including, but not limited to, corn, soybeans, wheat, oats, grain sorghum, canola, and rice;
        (2) livestock, including, but not limited to, hogs,
    	
equine, sheep, and poultry;
        (3) ensilage; and
        (4) fruits and vegetables.
    Permits may be issued for a period not to exceed 40 days and moves may be made of a distance not to exceed 50 miles from a field, an on-farm grain storage facility, a warehouse as defined in the Grain Code, or a livestock management facility as defined in the Livestock Management Facilities Act over any highway except the National System of Interstate and Defense Highways. The operator of the vehicle, however, must abide by posted bridge and posted highway weight limits. All implements of husbandry operating under this Section between sunset and sunrise shall be equipped as prescribed in Section 12-205.1.
    (e-1) A special permit shall be issued by the Department under this Section and shall be required from September 1 through December 31 for a vehicle that exceeds the maximum axle weight and gross weight limits under Section 15-111 of this Code or exceeds the vehicle's registered gross weight, provided that the vehicle's axle weight and gross weight do not exceed 10% above the maximum limits under Section 15-111 of this Code and does not exceed the vehicle's registered gross weight by 10%. All other restrictions that apply to permits issued under this Section shall apply during the declared time period and no fee shall be charged for the issuance of those permits. Permits issued by the Department under this subsection (e-1) are only valid on federal and State highways under the jurisdiction of the Department, except interstate highways. With respect to highways under the jurisdiction of local authorities, the local authorities may, at their discretion, waive special permit requirements and set a divisible load weight limit not to exceed 10% above a vehicle's registered gross weight, provided that the vehicle's axle weight and gross weight do not exceed 10% above the maximum limits specified in Section 15-111. Permits issued under this subsection (e-1) shall apply to all registered vehicles eligible to obtain permits under this Section, including vehicles used in private or for-hire movement of divisible load agricultural commodities during the declared time period.
    (f) The form and content of the permit shall be determined by the Department with respect to highways under its jurisdiction and by local authorities with respect to highways under their jurisdiction. Every permit shall be in written form and carried in the vehicle or combination of vehicles to which it refers and shall be open to inspection by any police officer or authorized agent of any authority granting the permit and no person shall violate any of the terms or conditions of such special permit. Violation of the terms and conditions of the permit shall not be deemed a revocation of the permit; however, any vehicle and load found to be off the route prescribed in the permit shall be held to be operating without a permit. Any off-route vehicle and load shall be required to obtain a new permit or permits, as necessary, to authorize the movement back onto the original permit routing. No rule or regulation, nor anything herein, shall be construed to authorize any police officer, court, or authorized agent of any authority granting the permit to remove the permit from the possession of the permittee unless the permittee is charged with a fraudulent permit violation as provided in subsection (i). However, upon arrest for an offense of violation of permit, operating without a permit when the vehicle is off route, or any size or weight offense under this Chapter when the permittee plans to raise the issuance of the permit as a defense, the permittee, or his agent, must produce the permit at any court hearing concerning the alleged offense.
    If the permit designates and includes a routing to a certified scale, the permittee, while en route to the designated scale, shall be deemed in compliance with the weight provisions of the permit provided the axle or gross weights do not exceed any of the permitted limits by more than the following amounts:
        Single axle               2000 pounds
        Tandem axle               3000 pounds
        Gross                     5000 pounds
    (g) The Department is authorized to adopt, amend, and make available to interested persons a policy concerning reasonable rules, limitations and conditions or provisions of operation upon highways under its jurisdiction in addition to those contained in this Section for the movement by special permit of vehicles, combinations, or loads which cannot reasonably be dismantled or disassembled, including manufactured and modular home sections and portions thereof. All rules, limitations and conditions or provisions adopted in the policy shall have due regard for the safety of the traveling public and the protection of the highway system and shall have been promulgated in conformity with the provisions of the Illinois Administrative Procedure Act. The requirements of the policy for flagmen and escort vehicles shall be the same for all moves of comparable size and weight. When escort vehicles are required, they shall meet the following requirements:
        (1) All operators shall be 18 years of age or over
    	
and properly licensed to operate the vehicle.
        (2) Vehicles escorting oversized loads more than 12
    	
feet wide must be equipped with a rotating or flashing amber light mounted on top as specified under Section 12-215.
    The Department shall establish reasonable rules and regulations regarding liability insurance or self insurance for vehicles with oversized loads promulgated under the Illinois Administrative Procedure Act. Police vehicles may be required for escort under circumstances as required by rules and regulations of the Department.
    (h) Violation of any rule, limitation or condition or provision of any permit issued in accordance with the provisions of this Section shall not render the entire permit null and void but the violator shall be deemed guilty of violation of permit and guilty of exceeding any size, weight, or load limitations in excess of those authorized by the permit. The prescribed route or routes on the permit are not mere rules, limitations, conditions, or provisions of the permit, but are also the sole extent of the authorization granted by the permit. If a vehicle and load are found to be off the route or routes prescribed by any permit authorizing movement, the vehicle and load are operating without a permit. Any off-route movement shall be subject to the size and weight maximums, under the applicable provisions of this Chapter, as determined by the type or class highway upon which the vehicle and load are being operated.
    (i) Whenever any vehicle is operated or movement made under a fraudulent permit, the permit shall be void, and the person, firm, or corporation to whom such permit was granted, the driver of such vehicle in addition to the person who issued such permit and any accessory, shall be guilty of fraud and either one or all persons may be prosecuted for such violation. Any person, firm, or corporation committing such violation shall be guilty of a Class 4 felony and the Department shall not issue permits to the person, firm, or corporation convicted of such violation for a period of one year after the date of conviction. Penalties for violations of this Section shall be in addition to any penalties imposed for violation of other Sections of this Code.
    (j) Whenever any vehicle is operated or movement made in violation of a permit issued in accordance with this Section, the person to whom such permit was granted, or the driver of such vehicle, is guilty of such violation and either, but not both, persons may be prosecuted for such violation as stated in this subsection (j). Any person, firm, or corporation convicted of such violation shall be guilty of a petty offense and shall be fined, for the first offense, not less than $50 nor more than $200 and, for the second offense by the same person, firm, or corporation within a period of one year, not less than $200 nor more than $300 and, for the third offense by the same person, firm, or corporation within a period of one year after the date of the first offense, not less than $300 nor more than $500 and the Department may, in its discretion, not issue permits to the person, firm, or corporation convicted of a third offense during a period of one year after the date of conviction or supervision for such third offense. If any violation is the cause or contributing cause in a motor vehicle accident causing damage to property, injury, or death to a person, the Department may, in its discretion, not issue a permit to the person, firm, or corporation for a period of one year after the date of conviction or supervision for the offense.
    (k) Whenever any vehicle is operated on local roads under permits for excess width or length issued by local authorities, such vehicle may be moved upon a State highway for a distance not to exceed one-half mile without a permit for the purpose of crossing the State highway.
    (l) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section, the Department, with respect to highways under its jurisdiction, and local authorities, with respect to highways under their jurisdiction, may at their discretion authorize the movement of a vehicle in violation of any size or weight requirement, or both, that would not ordinarily be eligible for a permit, when there is a showing of extreme necessity that the vehicle and load should be moved without unnecessary delay.
    For the purpose of this subsection, showing of extreme necessity shall be limited to the following: shipments of livestock, hazardous materials, liquid concrete being hauled in a mobile cement mixer, or hot asphalt.
    (m) Penalties for violations of this Section shall be in addition to any penalties imposed for violating any other Section of this Code.
    (n) The Department with respect to highways under its jurisdiction and local authorities with respect to highways under their jurisdiction, in their discretion and upon application in writing, may issue a special permit for continuous limited operation, authorizing the applicant to operate a tow truck that exceeds the weight limits provided for in subsection (a) of Section 15-111, provided:
        (1) no rear single axle of the tow truck exceeds
    	
26,000 pounds;
        (2) no rear tandem axle of the tow truck exceeds
    	
50,000 pounds;
        (2.1) no triple rear axle on a manufactured recovery
    	
unit exceeds 60,000 pounds;
        (3) neither the disabled vehicle nor the disabled
    	
combination of vehicles exceed the weight restrictions imposed by this Chapter 15, or the weight limits imposed under a permit issued by the Department prior to hookup;
        (4) the tow truck prior to hookup does not exceed the
    	
weight restrictions imposed by this Chapter 15;
        (5) during the tow operation the tow truck does not
    	
violate any weight restriction sign;
        (6) the tow truck is equipped with flashing,
    	
rotating, or oscillating amber lights, visible for at least 500 feet in all directions;
        (7) the tow truck is specifically designed and
    	
licensed as a tow truck;
        (8) the tow truck has a gross vehicle weight rating
    	
of sufficient capacity to safely handle the load;
        (9) the tow truck is equipped with air brakes;
        (10) the tow truck is capable of utilizing the
    	
lighting and braking systems of the disabled vehicle or combination of vehicles;
        (11) the tow commences at the initial point of wreck
    	
or disablement and terminates at a point where the repairs are actually to occur;
        (12) the permit issued to the tow truck is carried in
    	
the tow truck and exhibited on demand by a police officer; and
        (13) the movement shall be valid only on State routes
    	
approved by the Department.
    (o) (Blank).
    (p) In determining whether a load may be reasonably dismantled or disassembled for the purpose of subsection (a), the Department shall consider whether there is a significant negative impact on the condition of the pavement and structures along the proposed route, whether the load or vehicle as proposed causes a safety hazard to the traveling public, whether dismantling or disassembling the load promotes or stifles economic development, and whether the proposed route travels less than 5 miles. A load is not required to be dismantled or disassembled for the purposes of subsection (a) if the Secretary of the Department determines there will be no significant negative impact to pavement or structures along the proposed route, the proposed load or vehicle causes no safety hazard to the traveling public, dismantling or disassembling the load does not promote economic development, and the proposed route travels less than 5 miles. The Department may promulgate rules for the purpose of establishing the divisibility of a load pursuant to subsection (a). Any load determined by the Secretary to be nondivisible shall otherwise comply with the existing size or weight maximums specified in this Chapter.

    Sec. 15-302. Fees for special permits. The Department with respect to highways under its jurisdiction shall collect a fee from the applicant for the issuance of a permit to operate or move a vehicle or combination of vehicles or load as authorized in Section 15-301. The charge for each permit shall consist of:
        1. a service charge for special handling of a permit
    	
when requested by an applicant;
        2. fees for any dimension, axle weight or gross
    	
weight in excess of the maximum size or weight specified in this Chapter; and
        3. additional fees for special investigations as in
    	
Section 15-311 and special police escort as in Section 15-312 when required.
    With respect to overweight fees, the charge shall be sufficient to compensate in part for the cost of the extra wear and tear on the mileage of highways over which the load is to be moved. With respect to over-dimension permits, the fee shall be sufficient to compensate in part for the special privilege of transporting oversize vehicle or vehicle combination and load and to compensate in part for the economic loss of operators of vehicles in regular operation due to inconvenience occasioned by the oversize movements.
    Fees to be paid by the applicant are to be at the rates specified in this Chapter. In determining the fees in Section 15-306 and paragraph (f) of Section 15-307, all weights shall be to the next highest 1,000 pounds and all distances shall be determined from the Illinois Official Highway Map.
    For repeated moves of like objects which cannot be dismantled or disassembled and which are monolithically structured for permanent use in the transported form, the fees specified in Sections 15-305, 15-306 and 15-307 for other than the first move shall be reduced by $4 provided the objects are to be moved from the same origin to the same destination, the number of trips will not be less than 5, the trips will be completed within 30 days, and all applications are submitted at one time. Round trip permits shall be the same as a single trip permit except the fee shall be computed based upon the total distance traveled, and shall be for the same vehicle, vehicle combination or like load traveling both directions over the same route, provided a description including make and model of the equipment being transported is furnished to the Department. Limited continuous operation permits are to be valid for a period of 90 days or one year, and shall be for the same vehicle, vehicle combination or like load.

AVOID MULTIPLE COURT APPEARANCES
    If you intend to plead "not guilty" to this charge, or if, in addition, you intend to demand a trial by jury, so notify the clerk of the court at least 5 days (excluding Saturdays, Sundays or holidays) before the day set for your appearance. A new appearance date will be set, and arrangements will be made to have the arresting officer present on that new date. Failure to notify the clerk of either your intention to plead "not guilty" or your intention to demand a jury trial, may result in your having to return to court, if you plead "not guilty" on the date originally set for your court appearance. Upon timely receipt of notice that the accused intends to plead "not guilty", the clerk shall set a new appearance date not less than 7 days nor more than 49 days after the original appearance date set by the arresting officer, and notify all parties of the new date and the time for appearance. If the accused fails to notify the clerk as provided above, the arresting officer's failure to appear on the date originally set for appearance may, in counties other than Cook, be considered good cause for a continuance.

operator of a relocated vehicle, in written form as prescribed by Commission rule or regulation, the relevant statutes, regulations and ordinances governing commercial vehicle relocators, including, in at least 12 point boldface type, the name, address and telephone number of the nearest office of the Commission to which inquiries or complaints may be sent;
        (13.2) To fail, in the office or location at which
    	
relocated vehicles are routinely returned to their owners, to ensure that the relocator's representative provides suitable evidence of his or her identity to the owners of relocated vehicles upon request;

with this Chapter, more than 15 air miles from its location when towed from a location in an unincorporated area of a county or more than 10 air miles from its location when towed from any other location;
        (15) To fail to make a telephone number available to
    	
the police department of any municipality in which a relocator operates at which the relocator or an employee of the relocator may be contacted at any time during the hours in which the relocator is engaged in the towing of vehicles, or advertised as engaged in the towing of vehicles, for the purpose of effectuating the release of a towed vehicle; or to fail to include the telephone number in any advertisement of the relocator's services published or otherwise appearing on or after the effective date of this amendatory Act; or to fail to have an employee available at any time on the premises owned or controlled by the relocator for the purposes of arranging for the immediate release of the vehicle.

If equipment is leased to one relocator, it cannot thereafter be leased to another relocator until a written cancellation of lease is properly filed with the Commission;
        (17) To use drivers or other personnel who are not
    	
employees or contractors of the relocator;
        (18) To fail to refund any amount charged in excess
    	
of the reasonable rate established by the Commission;

    (a) Definitions. For purposes of this Section:
    "Department" means the Department of State Police.
    "Equipment interchange agreement" means a written document executed by the intermodal equipment provider and operator at the time the equipment is interchanged by the provider to the operator.
    "Equipment provider" is the owner of an intermodal trailer, chassis, or container. This includes any forwarding company, water carrier, steamship line, railroad, vehicle equipment leasing company, and their subsidiary or affiliated companies owning the equipment.
    "Federal motor carrier safety regulations" means regulations promulgated by the United States Department of Transportation governing the condition and maintenance of commercial motor vehicles contained in Title 49 of the United States Code of Federal Regulations on the day of enactment of this Act or as amended or revised by the United States Department of Transportation thereafter.
    "Interchange" means the act of providing a vehicle to a motor carrier by an equipment provider for the purpose of transporting the vehicle for loading or unloading by another party or the repositioning of the vehicle for the benefit of the equipment provider. "Interchange" does not include the leasing of the vehicle by a motor carrier from an owner-operator pursuant to subpart B of Part 376 of Title 49 of the Code of Federal Regulations or the leasing of a vehicle to a motor carrier for use in the motor carrier's over-the-road freight hauling operations.
    "Operator" means a motor carrier or driver of a commercial motor vehicle.
    "Vehicle" means an intermodal trailer, chassis, or container.

violation due to a defect in any equipment specified in subsection (d)(2), the equipment provider shall reimburse the operator for any:
            (A) fines and costs, including court costs and
        	
reasonable attorneys fees, incurred as a result of the citation; and
            (B) costs incurred by the operator to repair the
        	
defects specified in the citation, including any towing costs incurred.
        The equipment provider shall reimburse the operator
    	
within 30 days of the final court action. If the equipment provider fails to reimburse the operator within 30 days, the operator has a civil cause of action against the equipment provider.
    (e) Fines and penalties. Any person violating the provisions of this Section shall be fined no less than $50 and no more than $500 for each violation.

    Sec. 18c-1102. Legislative Intent. The General Assembly finds that:
        (a) a comprehensive recodification of existing
    	
transportation regulatory statutes is needed to delete obsolete provisions and facilitate a coordinated approach to regulation of motor carriers, rail carriers, and brokers;
        (b) the accelerating pace of change in the
    	
transportation industry, as an outgrowth of changing economic conditions and federal legislation, necessitates the streamlining of regulatory procedures to allow for prompt action to protect the interests of the people of the State of Illinois; and
        (c) an increasing incidence of unlawful activity by
    	
unlicensed carriers and others has rendered existing enforcement mechanisms inadequate.
     Where the language of any provision in this Chapter is substantially similar to the language in the predecessor statute, the legislative intent expressed in this Chapter shall be the same as the legislative intent embodied in the predecessor statute as construed by the courts of this State and, where appropriate, reports of the Illinois Motor Vehicle Laws Commission.

Where such person is found by the Commission to have violated this Chapter, and where the Commission imposes a sanction for such violation under Section 18c-1704 of this Chapter, the Commission may impose on such person an assessment of reasonable expenses incurred by the Commission in the investigation and subsequent proceeding. Such assessment shall not exceed a fee of $100 per work day or $50 per half work day, per employee, for the payroll costs of the Commission staff, plus actual transportation (in accordance with applicable state employee travel expense reimbursement regulations) and all other actual expenses incurred in the special investigation and subsequent proceeding.
    (3) Arrests and Citations. The Commission shall make arrests and issue notices of civil violations where necessary for the enforcement of this Chapter. No rail carrier employee shall be arrested for violation of this Chapter. No person operating a motor vehicle in violation of the licensing or safety provisions of this Chapter shall be permitted to transport property or passengers beyond the point of arrest unless, in the opinion of the officer making the arrest, it is necessary to transport the property or passengers to another location to insure their safety or to preserve or tend cargo carried in the vehicle.

    Sec. 18c-1704. Sanctions. Each violation of this Chapter shall subject the violator to the following sanctions, except as otherwise provided elsewhere in this Chapter. Sanctions provided for in this Section may be imposed by the Commission only in compliance with the notice and hearing requirements of Section 18c-2102 of this Chapter.
    (1) Criminal Misdemeanor Penalties. Each violation of this Chapter shall constitute a Class C misdemeanor.
    (2) Civil Penalties. The Commission may assess, against any person found by it to have violated this Chapter, a civil penalty not greater than $1,000 nor less than $100 per violation. The penalty assessed by the Commission shall reflect the number and severity of violations found to have been committed. Penalties assessed by the Commission shall be enforced by any court having venue in enforcement cases under this Chapter.
    (3) Cease and Desist Orders. The Commission may, where a person is found after hearing to have violated this Chapter, Commission regulations or orders, and justice requires, order the person to cease and desist from further or from any future violations. A cease and desist order may be entered on the Commission's own motion or by agreement between the parties. Orders and agreements under this Section shall be valid and enforceable for the period stated therein, not to exceed 2 years from the date the order or agreement is approved by the Commission, unless the parties stipulate otherwise. Such orders and agreements shall be enforceable in any court of this State having venue and jurisdiction in enforcement actions under this Chapter. Failure to comply with a Commission cease and desist order shall constitute a violation of this Chapter separate and apart from any underlying violations.
    (4) Stipulated Settlements.
        (a) General Provisions. The Commission may accept a
    	
reasonable monetary settlement, suspension or revocation of a license or registration, or any other reasonable terms stipulated between the respondent and staff, with or without a finding of violations.
        (b) Presumption of Reasonableness. Such stipulations
    	
shall be presumed reasonable. Unless the terms of a stipulation exceed such parameters as the Commission may establish, this presumption is rebuttable only by evidence of record at hearing.
        (c) Parameters. Parameters for settlement shall be
    	
based on type of violation; severity, as measured by revenues from unlawful activities; and number of violations. Minimum settlement amounts may be established.
        (d) Orders. Orders suspending proposed settlements
    	
shall cite reasons for suspension which are specific to the case. Orders rejecting proposed settlements shall recite the grounds on which the settlements are found to be unreasonable and describe the evidence which supports such findings.
    (5) Injunctive Relief. Any court with jurisdiction and venue for purposes of enforcing this Chapter shall have the power to enjoin any person from committing violations of this Chapter. Suit for penalties shall not be a prerequisite to injunctive relief. No bond shall be required when injunctive relief is granted at the request of the Commission.
    (6) Suspension or Revocation of Licenses and Registrations.
        (a) Availability of Suspension and Revocation as
    	
Sanctions. Violation of this Chapter by a motor carrier of property or passengers shall, in addition to other sanctions provided herein, subject the violator to suspension or revocation of any or all Commission licenses and registrations. The Commission may impose the sanctions of suspension and revocation. Where the violation is failure of a motor carrier of property or passengers to have in effect and file proof of continuous insurance coverage in accordance with this Chapter, Commission regulations and orders, the license or registration or both may be suspended by telephonic or telegraphic directive, confirmed by certified or registered mail or personal service, pending final disposition of revocation proceedings.
        (b) Suspension Pending Adjudication. Where the
    	
violation is failure of a motor carrier of property to pay a franchise or franchise renewal fee, the license or registration or both may be suspended by certified or registered mail or personally served directive, pending final disposition of revocation proceedings.
        (c) Special Revocation Procedures.
            (i) Notice. The Commission shall serve notice
        	
upon all persons who have failed to pay a franchise tax, license fee, or penalty required under the Business Corporation Act of 1983, or who have failed to comply with this Chapter, Commission regulations and orders, regarding the filing of proof of continuous insurance or bond coverage, the payment of periodic fees, the filing of periodic reports, the payment of civil penalties, or the filing of rates to the full extent of a carrier's authority. The notice shall advise such person of the apparent violations and state that, unless the Commission receives a written request for hearing or extension of time within 30 days from the date the notice is served, the person's license or registration will be revoked by operation of law without further action by the Commission.
            (ii) Extensions of Time. The Commission may grant
        	
one extension of time not exceeding 60 days where the extension will not endanger the public.
            (iii) Request for Hearing. If a timely written
        	
request for hearing is received, no further action shall be taken until the requirements of Section 18c-2102 of this Chapter have been satisfied.
            (iv) Revocation by Operation of Law. If, at the
        	
expiration of the applicable time period, the person has not complied with the pertinent requirements, and a written request for hearing has not been received, the person will be deemed to have waived hearing and the license or registration shall be revoked by operation of law without further action by the Commission as if the Commission has served an order on the date following expiration revoking the license or registration.
    (7) Probation. The Commission may probate the imposition of any of the sanctions set forth in this Section.

Commission shall provide for any appropriate and necessary review of proposed settlements within 30 days after a stipulation is signed by the parties. Unless a stipulation is suspended for review by order of the Commission served within 30 calendar days after it was signed by the parties, it shall be deemed accepted by operation of law. A stipulation which has been suspended for review shall likewise be deemed accepted by operation of law unless it is rejected by order of the Commission served within 45 days after it was suspended. A stipulation which is deemed accepted under this sub-paragraph shall become effective and shall be enforceable in the same manner as an order of the Commission.
        (iii) Administrative Appeal of Settlements.
    	
Administrative appeal of a stipulation which has been approved by order of the Commission or by operation of law shall be by motion for rehearing or reconsideration in accordance with Section 18c-2110 of this Chapter. The right to administratively appeal a settlement may be waived by written stipulation.

    Sec. 18c-2105. Discovery. (1) Discovery Generally. Any party may utilize written interrogatories, depositions, requests for discovery or inspection of documents or property and other discovery tools commonly utilized in civil actions in the circuit courts in the State of Illinois in the manner contemplated by the Code of Civil Procedure and the Rules of the Supreme Court of Illinois; except that discovery must be completed by the 30th day after the party filed its petition for leave to intervene, unless the period of discovery is extended by agreement of the parties or by the Commission. The Chairman or a hearing examiner may, at any time, on his own motion or at the request of a party, issue such rulings denying, limiting, conditioning, or regulating discovery as justice requires, and may supervise all or part of any discovery procedure. Parties to proceedings before the Commission are encouraged to clarify and resolve issues where possible through the use of pre-hearing discovery. However, discovery order should be calculated to lessen the time and expense required to reach an informed resolution of the issues.
    (2) Subpoenas. The Chairman or a hearing examiner may, for good cause, issue a subpoena directing a person to appear and testify, and to produce records, documents, or other papers, at a time and place set forth in the subpoena, in connection with a proceeding before the Commission. Service of the subpoena shall be in the same manner as a subpoena issued by a court. The Commission may, on its own motion or the motion of a person served with a subpoena, quash the subpoena, in whole or in part.
    (3) Appeal from Discovery and Subpoenas. A person served with a discovery request or subpoena may appeal such interlocutory matter to the Commission. Such appeals shall set forth grounds for seeking to quash or limit the scope of the discovery or subpoena, as well as the specific relief sought, and must be filed within 10 days after service of the discovery or subpoena. If discovery is stayed by the Commission, the person served shall be excused from compliance with the discovery order or subpoena until a decision on its appeal is made by the Commission.
    (4) Assessment and Payment of Discovery Costs. The Commission may assess the costs of discovery, including fees for witness attendance and travel, against the party by which discovery was requested. Where a subpoena is issued on the Commission's own motion, fees for witness attendance and travel shall be paid by the Commission on request. Witness fees shall be the same as for a circuit court proceeding. Deposits to insure payment of costs and fees may be required.
    (5) Enforcement of Discovery Procedures. The Commission may, where a person has failed to comply with or permit discovery authorized hereunder, determine any or all issues within the scope of the discovery or subpoena adverse to such person without further evidence. The Commission may, in addition, assess civil penalties under Article VII of Sub-chapter 1 of this Chapter for such violator for contempt and may assess the costs of enforcement, both before the Commission and before the court, against the violator.

The filing or granting of a request for an oral hearing shall not, unless the Commission so provides, stay the issuance or effect of any emergency temporary order under this subsection.
    (2) Interim orders.

If the Commission fails to act on any such motion within 45 days after it is filed, or up to 90 days if the period for acting on the motion has been extended by the Commission in writing, the motion shall be deemed to have been denied by operation of law.
    (g) Appeals of Rulings by Hearing Examiners. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section, interlocutory appeals of rulings by hearing examiners shall be as provided by the Commission's Rules of Practice; no other appeals of action or inaction by a hearing examiner may be taken.
    (2) Motions to Reopen. The Commission may, at any time after notice to the parties and the public, reopen a proceeding to consider clarification, modification, or rescission of its order. Reopening may be on the Commission's own motion or on the motion of any interested person. Upon a finding of clerical or technical error the Commission may modify or rescind its order in the proceeding. The Commission may not, on reopening, impair the vested rights of any person.

    (1) Initiation of proceedings. The Commission may initiate a proceeding to investigate or prescribe tariffs or schedules on its own motion or on complaint.
    (2) Suspension of tariffs and schedules.
        (a) Suspension of tariffs. The Commission may suspend
    	
a tariff, in whole or in part, during the pendency of a proceeding to consider the reasonableness of the tariff, or to consider whether the tariff is discriminatory, or to consider whether the tariff otherwise violates provisions of this Chapter, Commission regulations or orders, provided the order of suspension is issued prior to the effective date of the tariff. The suspension shall remain in effect for the period allowed under this Chapter unless the Commission order provides for a shorter period of suspension. At the end of the statutory suspension period the suspension may be extended by agreement of the parties; otherwise, the tariff shall go into effect. The statutory suspension period is:
            (i) Seven months for public carriers and
        	
household goods common carriers;
            (ii) One hundred and twenty days for motor

period is extended for an additional 3 months in accordance with provisions of the Interstate Commerce Act.
        (b) Suspension of schedules. The Commission may
    	
suspend a household goods contract carrier schedule, in whole or in part, during the pendency of a proceeding to consider whether the schedule violates provisions of this Chapter, Commission regulations or orders, provided the order of suspension is issued prior to the effective date of the schedule. The suspension shall remain in effect for 7 months unless the Commission order provides for a shorter period of suspension. At the end of this period, the suspension may be extended by agreement of the parties; otherwise, the schedule shall go into effect.
        (c) Burden of proof in investigation proceedings. The
    	
burden of proof in an investigation proceeding shall be on the proponent of the rate unless otherwise provided in a valid preemptive federal statute which governs the rate.
    (3) Prescription of tariffs and schedules. The Commission may prescribe tariffs where it has determined, in accordance with Section 18c-2102 of this Chapter, that a tariff published by a carrier is unreasonable, discriminatory, or otherwise in violation of this Chapter, Commission regulations or orders. The Commission may prescribe schedules where it has determined, after hearing, that a schedule filed by a carrier is in violation of this Chapter, Commission regulations or orders.
    (4) Relief. The Commission may, where it finds a tariff or schedule to be in violation of this Chapter, its regulations or orders, or finds rates or provisions in a tariff unjust, unreasonable, or discriminatory, and in accordance with Section 18c-2102 of this Chapter, direct the carrier to:
        (a) Publish and file a supplement cancelling the
    	
tariff or file notice of cancellation of the schedule, in whole or in part;
        (b) Publish and file a new tariff or file a new
    	
schedule containing rates and provisions prescribed by the Commission; and

The Commission may likewise, in accordance with Section 18c-2101 of this Chapter, order any carrier other than a household goods carrier to pay to one or more shippers the amount by which the carrier received compensation greater than reasonable rates and charges as determined by the Commission.
        (b) Collection of undercharges. The Commission may,
    	
in accordance to Section 18c-2101 of this Chapter, order any carrier to make all reasonable efforts to collect from one or more shippers the difference between amounts collected and the amount of compensation specified in tariffs or schedules in effect at the time the transportation or other service in connection therewith was rendered.

    (1) Presentation of freight bills. Freight bills shall be presented to the person responsible for payment of freight charges not later than the 7th day following delivery of the freight.
    (2) Payment required before delivery or relinquishment of possession. Except as provided in subsection (3) of this Section, no common carrier shall deliver or relinquish possession of a shipment transported by it until all freight charges for such shipment under lawfully applicable rates have been paid to the carrier. Where credit has been extended in accordance with this Section, and all freight charges on the shipment under lawfully applicable rates have not been paid before expiration of the period for which credit has been extended, the carrier shall cease delivering or relinquishing possession of the shipment and may decline to transport future shipments until all such charges have been paid.
    (3) Exception: Delivery or relinquishment of possession before payment. A carrier may deliver or relinquish possession of a shipment transported by it in advance of payment of all freight charges on the shipment under lawfully applicable rates if the carrier has, in accordance with this Section, extended credit to the person responsible for payment of freight charges.
    (4) Extension of credit. Credit, if extended by a carrier, must be extended without discrimination. Credit for payment of freight charges shown on the initial freight bill shall be for a period not to exceed 30 days, beginning on the later of the date of delivery or the date on which the freight bill is presented. If freight charges shown on the initial freight bill are paid and the carrier subsequently presents a supplemental freight bill, the carrier may extend credit in the amount of freight charges shown on the supplemental freight bill for an additional period not to exceed 15 days, beginning on the date on which the supplemental freight bill is presented.

    (3) Equipment Leasing.
        (a) Requirements for Content, Filing, and Carrying of

The Commission shall exercise its discretion in regard to issuance of common carrier of household goods or contract carrier of household goods licenses in accordance with standards enumerated in this Section.
    (1) Standards relevant to both common and contract household goods carrier licenses. In determining whether to issue a common carrier of household goods certificate or a contract carrier of household goods permit under Sections 18c-4202 and 18c-4203 of this Chapter, the Commission shall consider, in addition to other standards enumerated in this Chapter:
        (a) (Blank);
        (b) The existing authorized carriers' services,
    	
including the adequacy of such services and the effect which issuance of a new certificate or permit would have on such services;
        (c) (Blank);
        (d) Any evidence bearing on the fitness, willingness,
    	
or ability of the applicant, including but not limited to any past history of violations of this Chapter, Commission regulations or orders, whether or not such violations were the subject of an enforcement proceeding; and
        (e) The effect which issuing the certificate or
    	
permit would have on the development, maintenance and preservation of the highways of this State for commercial and other public use.
    (2) Additional standards relevant to household goods contract carrier licenses.

        (a) Whether the proposed service is contract carrier
    	
service; and
        (b) The effect which failure to issue the permit
    	
would have on the supporting shipper or shippers.
    (3) Standards not relevant to either household goods common or household goods contract carrier licenses. In determining whether to issue a household goods common carrier certificate or a household goods contract carrier permit under Sections 18c-4202 and 18c-4203 of this Chapter, the Commission shall not consider:
        (a) The mere preference of the supporting shipper or
    	
shippers or their receiver or receivers for the applicant's service; or
        (b) Any illegal operations of the applicant as
    	
evidence of shipper need or the inadequacy of existing carriers' services.

    (1) Establishment of administrative standards. The Commission shall, within 180 days from the effective date of this amendatory Act of 1987, adopt and implement standards for determining fitness to hold or continue to hold a household goods carrier license.
    (2) Statutory standards. A person shall not be considered fit for purposes of this Section unless the record shows that, at the time of hearing, the person:
        (a) Is aware of its obligations under this Chapter,
    	
Commission regulations and orders, and other provisions of The Illinois Vehicle Code;
        (b) Has substantially complied with applicable
    	
statutes and regulations; and
        (c) Possesses the equipment, facilities, financial
    	
resources, knowledge and experience to provide the proposed service and meet the needs of supporting shippers, in compliance with applicable statutes and regulations, on a long-term basis.
    (3) Burden of proof in application proceedings.
        (a) Temporary authority. Each applicant for
    	
temporary household goods carrier authority shall have the burden of making a prima facie showing of fitness. The Commission may, in its discretion, deny an application for temporary household goods authority where the applicant's fitness is controverted by specific allegations, under oath, by an intervenor.
        (b) Permanent authority. Each applicant for
    	
permanent household goods authority shall have the burden of proving its fitness by clear and convincing evidence.
        (c) Findings. The order granting permanent household
    	
goods authority shall contain specific findings, with citation to the record, on each aspect of fitness.
    (4) Revocation proceedings. If the record in a revocation proceeding shows that a licensee is no longer fit to hold a household goods carrier license, the Commission shall suspend or revoke the license. When a license is suspended under this Section, the holder shall have 6 months in which to demonstrate, by clear and convincing evidence, that its fitness has been restored. Unless the Commission finds that such a demonstration has been made, the license shall be revoked. A license revoked under this Section shall not be reinstated.

    (1) Dual common/contract operations. No person shall hold both a household goods common carrier certificate and a household goods contract carrier permit unless the Commission determines, or has determined, that both licenses may be held consistent with the public interest and authorizes such dual licensing. Issuance of household goods contract carrier authority after the effective date of this amendatory Act of 1995 to a person that already holds household goods common carrier authority, or vice versa, shall be rebuttably presumed inconsistent with the public interest if the two authorities would be duplicative, in whole or in part.
    (2) Merger of duplicative operating rights. The Commission may, except as otherwise provided in this subsection, order that duplicative operating rights, whether household goods common carrier or household goods contract carrier or both, be merged into a single license and may impose such requirements upon operations under such license as will promote the public interest and effectuate the purposes of this Chapter. The power of the Commission to order merger shall not extend to duplicative operating rights in existence on the effective date of this Chapter.

Except as provided in this Article, no person may enter into a transaction to accomplish or effectuate, or participate in accomplishing or effectuating, the ownership, control or management of any one or more motor carriers, however such result is attained, whether directly or indirectly by use of common directors, officers, or stockholders, a holding or investment company, a voting trust, or in any other manner, and regardless of whether or not the carrier received compensation or value from the transaction. Nor shall any person continue to maintain control or management accomplished or effectuated in violation of this Article. The words "control or management," when used in this Article, shall be construed to include the power to exercise control or management.
    (2) Direct Supervision and Control by License Holder Required. The holder of a motor carrier license shall exercise direct supervision and control over all operations conducted with vehicles registered under its license or utilized in conducting operations under its license. The holder may be called upon to demonstrate that it is exercising direct supervision and control. Failure to exercise active supervision and control shall constitute the unauthorized transfer of operating rights in violation of this Chapter. Where an unauthorized transfer occurs, both the transferor and transferee shall have committed violations of this Chapter. Nothing contained herein shall prevent the holder from exercising such supervision and control through a manager or other bona fide employee of the holder. Elements to be considered in evaluating whether supervision and control is being exercised include solicitation; public identification; billing; collecting; dispatching drivers and equipment; hiring; evaluation and firing of drivers and other personnel; liability for cargo loss or damage; and responsibility for payment of carrier expenses.

    (1) Application for approval. Any carrier party to an agreement between or among 2 or more carriers relating to rates, fares, classifications, divisions, allowances, or charges (including charges between carriers and compensation paid or received for the use of facilities and equipment), or rules and regulations pertaining thereto, or procedures for the joint consideration, initiation, or establishment thereof, whether such conference, bureau, committee, or other organization be a "for-profit" or "not-for-profit" corporate entity or whether or not such conference, bureau, committee or other organization is or will be controlled by other businesses may, under such rules and regulations as the Commission may prescribe, apply to the Commission for approval of the agreement, and the Commission shall by order approve any such agreement, if approval thereof is not prohibited by subsection (3), (4), or (5) of this Section, if it finds that, by reason of furtherance of the State transportation policy declared in Section 18c-1103 of this Chapter, the relief provided in subsection (8) should apply with respect to the making and carrying out of such agreement; otherwise the application shall be denied. The approval of the Commission shall be granted only upon such terms and conditions as the Commission may prescribe as necessary to enable it to grant its approval in accordance with the standard above set forth in this paragraph.
    (2) Accounts, reporting, and internal procedures. Each conference, bureau, committee, or other organization established or continued pursuant to any agreement approved by the Commission under the provisions of this Section shall maintain such accounts, records, files and memoranda and shall submit to the Commission such reports, as may be prescribed by the Commission, and all such accounts, records, files, and memoranda shall be subject to inspection by the Commission or its duly authorized representatives. Any conference, bureau committee, or other organization described in subsection (1) of this Section shall cause to be published notice of the final disposition of any action taken by such entity together with a concise statement of the reasons therefor. The Commission shall withhold approval of any agreement under this Section unless the agreement specifies a reasonable period of time within which proposals by parties to the agreement will be finally acted upon by the conference, bureau, committee, or other organization.
    (3) Matters which may be the subject of agreements approved by the Commission. The Commission shall not approve under this Section any agreement between or among carriers of different classes unless it finds that such agreement is of the character described in subsection (1) of this Section and is limited to matters relating to transportation under joint rates or over through routes. For purposes of this paragraph carriers by railroad and express companies are carriers of one class; carriers by motor vehicle are carriers of one class and carriers by water are carriers of one class.
    (4) Non-applicability of Section to transfers. The Commission shall not approve under this Section any agreement which it finds is an agreement with respect to a pooling, division, or other matter or transaction, to which Section 18c-4302 of this Chapter is applicable.
    (5) Independent action. The Commission shall not approve under this Section any agreement which establishes a procedure for the determination of any matter through joint consideration unless it finds that under the agreement there is accorded to each party the free and unrestrained right to take independent action either before or after any determination arrived at through such procedures. The Commission shall not find that each party has a free and unrestrained right to take independent action if the conference, bureau, committee, or other organization is granted by the agreement any right to engage in proceedings before the Commission or before any court regarding any action taken by a party to an agreement authorized by this Section, or by any other party providing or seeking authority to provide transportation services.
    (6) Investigation of activities. The Commission is authorized, upon complaint or upon its own initiative without complaint, to investigate and determine whether any agreement previously approved by it under this Section or terms and conditions upon which such approval was granted, is not or are not in conformity with the standard, set forth in subsection (1), or whether any such terms and conditions are not necessary for purposes of conformity with such standard, and, after such investigation, the Commission shall by order terminate or modify its approval of such agreement if it finds such action necessary to insure conformity with such standard, and shall modify the terms and conditions upon which such approval was granted to the extent it finds necessary to insure conformity with such standard or to the extent to which it finds such terms and conditions not necessary to insure such conformity. The effective date of any order terminating or modifying approval, or modifying terms and conditions, shall be postponed for such period as the Commission determines to be reasonably necessary to avoid undue hardship.
    (7) Hearings and orders. No order shall be entered under this Section except after interested parties have been afforded reasonable opportunity for hearing.
    (8) Exemption from State antitrust laws. Parties to any agreement approved by the Commission under this Section and other persons are, if the approval of such agreement is not prohibited by subsection (3), (4), or (5), hereby relieved from the operation of the antitrust laws with respect to the making of such agreement, and with respect to the carrying out of such agreement in conformity with its provisions and in conformity with the terms and conditions prescribed by the Commission.
    (9) Other laws not affected. Any action of the Commission under this Section in approving an agreement, or in denying an application for such approval, or in terminating or modifying its approval of an agreement, or in prescribing the terms and conditions upon which its approval is to be granted, or in modifying such terms and conditions, shall be construed as having effect solely with reference to the applicability of the relief provisions of paragraph subsection (8) of this Section.

    Sec. 18c-6201. Requirements for issuance of licenses.
    (1) General requirements. Except as provided in subsection (2) of this Section, the Commission shall grant an application for a motor carrier of passengers license, in whole or in part, to the extent that it finds that the application was properly filed, a need for the proposed service exists, the applicant if fit, willing, and able to provide the service in compliance with this Chapter, Commission regulations and orders, absent a showing that issuance of the license would be inconsistent with the public interest. Otherwise, the application shall be denied. In determining whether issuance of a motor carrier of passengers license would be inconsistent with the public interest, the Commission shall consider:
        (a) the value of competition which would result from
    	
issuance to the travelling public;
        (b) the effect of issuance on motor carrier of
    	
passengers service to small communities;
        (c) the effect of issuance on the ability of any
    	
other carrier to provide a substantial portion of the passenger service such carrier provides over its entire system, except that diversion of revenue or traffic from a carrier in and of itself shall not be sufficient to support a finding that issuance of the license would impair the ability of the other carrier to provide a substantial portion of the passenger service such carrier provides over its entire system; and
        (d) any other factor relevant to the public interest.
    (2) Motor carriers of passengers providing service to or from airports. The Commission shall grant an application for a motor carrier of passengers license authorizing service along any route where an airport is a point to be served on the route, in whole or in part, to the extent that it finds that the application was properly filed, a need for the proposed service exists, the applicant is fit, willing, and able to provide the service in compliance with this Chapter, Commission regulations and orders, and the public convenience and necessity requires issuance of the license. Otherwise, the application shall be denied. The provisions of this subsection shall be construed to impose the same entry requirements as were previously applicable under Section 55 of "An Act concerning public utilities", approved June 29, 1921, as amended.

By March of each calendar year, each motor carrier of passengers shall submit to the Commission a list of routes and points which it is authorized to serve which the carrier has under consideration for discontinuance within the following 12 months. A carrier may amend its list on the 1st day of each subsequent month.
    (2) Notice of Intent to Discontinue. Not less than 30 days after a point appears on a list of points under consideration for discontinuance, the carrier may serve on the Commission the carrier's Notice of Intent to discontinue service. Such notice shall be for the purpose of alerting the Commission and allowing a period of time during which alternatives to discontinuance, or alternative service, may be explored.
    (3) Petitions to Discontinue. Not less than 60 nor more than 90 days after the filing of a Notice of Intent to discontinue, the carrier may formally propose discontinuance by filing in accordance with such requirements as to form and content as the Commission may prescribe. The Commission may investigate the proposal, and may suspend the discontinuance pending the outcome of the investigation for a period not to exceed 90 days from the date the proposal is filed. The Commission shall determine, after considering the public need for service, revenues (both those which have been received and those which might be received, by subsidy or otherwise) and variable costs associated with the service, and the availability of reasonable alternative transportation service whether the public convenience and necessity requires continuation of the service proposed to be discontinued. If the Commission determines that the public convenience and necessity requires continuation, it shall so order; otherwise, the proceeding shall be dismissed.
    (4) Waiver or Notice. Prior notice requirements under this Section may be waived for good cause or where the carrier has made substantial compliance with such prior notice requirements or compliance is not necessary to effectuate the purposes of this Chapter.

ARTICLE IV. SAFETY REQUIREMENTS FOR RAIL CARRIERS

    (625 ILCS 5/18c-7401) (from Ch. 95 1/2, par. 18c-7401)
    Sec. 18c-7401. Safety requirements for track, facilities, and equipment.
    (1) General Requirements. Each rail carrier shall, consistent with rules, orders, and regulations of the Federal Railroad Administration, construct, maintain, and operate all of its equipment, track, and other property in this State in such a manner as to pose no undue risk to its employees or the person or property of any member of the public.
    (2) Adoption of Federal Standards. The track safety standards and accident/incident standards promulgated by the Federal Railroad Administration shall be safety standards of the Commission. The Commission may, in addition, adopt by reference in its regulations other federal railroad safety standards, whether contained in federal statutes or in regulations adopted pursuant to such statutes.
    (3) Railroad Crossings. No public road, highway, or street shall hereafter be constructed across the track of any rail carrier at grade, nor shall the track of any rail carrier be constructed across a public road, highway or street at grade, without having first secured the permission of the Commission; provided, that this Section shall not apply to the replacement of lawfully existing roads, highways, and tracks. No public pedestrian bridge or subway shall be constructed across the track of any rail carrier without having first secured the permission of the Commission. The Commission shall have the right to refuse its permission or to grant it upon such terms and conditions as it may prescribe. The Commission shall have power to determine and prescribe the manner, including the particular point of crossing, and the terms of installation, operation, maintenance, use, and protection of each such crossing.
    The Commission shall also have power, after a hearing, to require major alteration of or to abolish any crossing, heretofore or hereafter established, when in its opinion, the public safety requires such alteration or abolition, and, except in cities, villages, and incorporated towns of 1,000,000 or more inhabitants, to vacate and close that part of the highway on such crossing altered or abolished and cause barricades to be erected across such highway in such manner as to prevent the use of such crossing as a highway, when, in the opinion of the Commission, the public convenience served by the crossing in question is not such as to justify the further retention thereof; or to require a separation of grades, at railroad-highway grade crossings; or to require a separation of grades at any proposed crossing where a proposed public highway may cross the tracks of any rail carrier or carriers; and to prescribe, after a hearing of the parties, the terms upon which such separations shall be made and the proportion in which the expense of the alteration or abolition of such crossings or the separation of such grades, having regard to the benefits, if any, accruing to the rail carrier or any party in interest, shall be divided between the rail carrier or carriers affected, or between such carrier or carriers and the State, county, municipality or other public authority in interest. However, a public hearing by the Commission to abolish a crossing shall not be required when the public highway authority in interest vacates the highway. In such instance the rail carrier, following notification to the Commission and the highway authority, shall remove any grade crossing warning devices and the grade crossing surface.
    The Commission shall also have power by its order to require the reconstruction, minor alteration, minor relocation, or improvement of any crossing (including the necessary highway approaches thereto) of any railroad across any highway or public road, pedestrian bridge, or pedestrian subway, whether such crossing be at grade or by overhead structure or by subway, whenever the Commission finds after a hearing or without a hearing as otherwise provided in this paragraph that such reconstruction, alteration, relocation, or improvement is necessary to preserve or promote the safety or convenience of the public or of the employees or passengers of such rail carrier or carriers. By its original order or supplemental orders in such case, the Commission may direct such reconstruction, alteration, relocation, or improvement to be made in such manner and upon such terms and conditions as may be reasonable and necessary and may apportion the cost of such reconstruction, alteration, relocation, or improvement and the subsequent maintenance thereof, having regard to the benefits, if any, accruing to the railroad or any party in interest, between the rail carrier or carriers and public utilities affected, or between such carrier or carriers and public utilities and the State, county, municipality or other public authority in interest. The cost to be so apportioned shall include the cost of changes or alterations in the equipment of public utilities affected as well as the cost of the relocation, diversion or establishment of any public highway, made necessary by such reconstruction, alteration, relocation, or improvement of said crossing. A hearing shall not be required in those instances when the Commission enters an order confirming a written stipulation in which the Commission, the public highway authority or other public authority in interest, the rail carrier or carriers affected, and in instances involving the use of the Grade Crossing Protection Fund, the Illinois Department of Transportation, agree on the reconstruction, alteration, relocation, or improvement and the subsequent maintenance thereof and the division of costs of such changes of any grade crossing (including the necessary highway approaches thereto) of any railroad across any highway, pedestrian bridge, or pedestrian subway.
    The Commission shall also have power to enter into stipulated agreements with a rail carrier or rail carriers or public authorities to fund, provide, install, and maintain safety treatments to deter trespassing on railroad property in accordance with paragraph (1) of Section 18c-7503 at locations approved by such rail carrier or rail carriers following a diagnostic evaluation between the Commission and the rail carrier or rail carriers, including any public authority in interest or the Federal Railroad Administration, and to order the allocation of the cost of those treatments and their installation and maintenance from the Grade Crossing Protection Fund. Safety treatments approved under this paragraph by the Commission shall be deemed adequate and appropriate.
    Every rail carrier operating in the State of Illinois shall construct and maintain every highway crossing over its tracks within the State so that the roadway at the intersection shall be as flush with the rails as superelevated curves will allow, and, unless otherwise ordered by the Commission, shall construct and maintain the approaches thereto at a grade of not more than 5% within the right of way for a distance of not less the 6 feet on each side of the centerline of such tracks; provided, that the grades at the approaches may be maintained in excess of 5% only when authorized by the Commission.
    Every rail carrier operating within this State shall remove from its right of way at all railroad-highway grade crossings within the State, such brush, shrubbery, and trees as is reasonably practical for a distance of not less than 500 feet in either direction from each grade crossing. The Commission shall have power, upon its own motion, or upon complaint, and after having made proper investigation, to require the installation of adequate and appropriate luminous reflective warning signs, luminous flashing signals, crossing gates illuminated at night, or other protective devices in order to promote and safeguard the health and safety of the public. Luminous flashing signal or crossing gate devices installed at grade crossings, which have been approved by the Commission, shall be deemed adequate and appropriate. The Commission shall have authority to determine the number, type, and location of such signs, signals, gates, or other protective devices which, however, shall conform as near as may be with generally recognized national standards, and the Commission shall have authority to prescribe the division of the cost of the installation and subsequent maintenance of such signs, signals, gates, or other protective devices between the rail carrier or carriers, the public highway authority or other public authority in interest, and in instances involving the use of the Grade Crossing Protection Fund, the Illinois Department of Transportation. Except where train crews provide flagging of the crossing to road users, yield signs shall be installed at all highway intersections with every grade crossing in this State that is not equipped with automatic warning devices, such as luminous flashing signals or crossing gate devices. A stop sign may be used in lieu of the yield sign when an engineering study conducted in cooperation with the highway authority and the Illinois Department of Transportation has determined that a stop sign is warranted. If the Commission has ordered the installation of luminous flashing signal or crossing gate devices at a grade crossing not equipped with active warning devices, the Commission shall order the installation of temporary stop signs at the highway intersection with the grade crossing unless an engineering study has determined that a stop sign is not appropriate. If a stop sign is not appropriate, the Commission may order the installation of other appropriate supplemental signing as determined by an engineering study. The temporary signs shall remain in place until the luminous flashing signal or crossing gate devices have been installed. The rail carrier is responsible for the installation and subsequent maintenance of any required signs. The permanent signs shall be in place by July 1, 2011.
    No railroad may change or modify the warning device system at a railroad-highway grade crossing, including warning systems interconnected with highway traffic control signals, without having first received the approval of the Commission. The Commission shall have the further power, upon application, upon its own motion, or upon complaint and after having made proper investigation, to require the interconnection of grade crossing warning devices with traffic control signals at highway intersections located at or near railroad crossings within the distances described by the State Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices adopted pursuant to Section 11-301 of this Code. In addition, State and local authorities may not install, remove, modernize, or otherwise modify traffic control signals at a highway intersection that is interconnected or proposed to be interconnected with grade crossing warning devices when the change affects the number, type, or location of traffic control devices on the track approach leg or legs of the intersection or the timing of the railroad preemption sequence of operation until the Commission has approved the installation, removal, modernization, or modification. Commission approval shall be limited to consideration of issues directly affecting the public safety at the railroad-highway grade crossing. The electrical circuit devices, alternate warning devices, and preemption sequences shall conform as nearly as possible, considering the particular characteristics of the crossing and intersection area, to the State manual adopted by the Illinois Department of Transportation pursuant to Section 11-301 of this Code and such federal standards as are made applicable by subsection (2) of this Section. In order to carry out this authority, the Commission shall have the authority to determine the number, type, and location of traffic control devices on the track approach leg or legs of the intersection and the timing of the railroad preemption sequence of operation. The Commission shall prescribe the division of costs for installation and maintenance of all devices required by this paragraph between the railroad or railroads and the highway authority in interest and in instances involving the use of the Grade Crossing Protection Fund or a State highway, the Illinois Department of Transportation.
    Any person who unlawfully or maliciously removes, throws down, damages or defaces any sign, signal, gate, or other protective device, located at or near any public grade crossing, shall be guilty of a petty offense and fined not less than $50 nor more than $200 for each offense. In addition to fines levied under the provisions of this Section a person adjudged guilty hereunder may also be directed to make restitution for the costs of repair or replacement, or both, necessitated by his misconduct.
    It is the public policy of the State of Illinois to enhance public safety by establishing safe grade crossings. In order to implement this policy, the Illinois Commerce Commission is directed to conduct public hearings and to adopt specific criteria by July 1, 1994, that shall be adhered to by the Illinois Commerce Commission in determining if a grade crossing should be opened or abolished. The following factors shall be considered by the Illinois Commerce Commission in developing the specific criteria for opening and abolishing grade crossings:
        (a) timetable speed of passenger trains;
        (b) distance to an alternate crossing;
        (c) accident history for the last 5 years;
        (d) number of vehicular traffic and posted speed
    	
limits;
        (e) number of freight trains and their timetable
    	
speeds;
        (f) the type of warning device present at the grade
    	
crossing;
        (g) alignments of the roadway and railroad, and the
    	
angle of intersection of those alignments;
        (h) use of the grade crossing by trucks carrying
    	
hazardous materials, vehicles carrying passengers for hire, and school buses; and
        (i) use of the grade crossing by emergency vehicles.
    The Illinois Commerce Commission, upon petition to open or abolish a grade crossing, shall enter an order opening or abolishing the crossing if it meets the specific criteria adopted by the Commission.
    Except as otherwise provided in this subsection (3), in no instance shall a grade crossing be permanently closed without public hearing first being held and notice of such hearing being published in an area newspaper of local general circulation.
    (4) Freight Trains; Radio Communications. The Commission shall after hearing and order require that every main line railroad freight train operating on main tracks outside of yard limits within this State shall be equipped with a radio communication system. The Commission after notice and hearing may grant exemptions from the requirements of this Section as to secondary and branch lines.
    (5) Railroad Bridges and Trestles; Walkway and Handrail. In cases in which the Commission finds the same to be practical and necessary for safety of railroad employees, bridges and trestles, over and upon which railroad trains are operated, shall include as a part thereof, a safe and suitable walkway and handrail on one side only of such bridge or trestle, and such handrail shall be located at the outer edge of the walkway and shall provide a clearance of not less than 8 feet, 6 inches, from the center line of the nearest track, measured at right angles thereto.
    (6) Packages Containing Articles for First Aid to Injured on Trains.
        (a) All rail carriers shall provide a first aid kit
    	
that contains, at a minimum, those articles prescribed by the Commission, on each train or engine, for first aid to persons who may be injured in the course of the operation of such trains.
        (b) A vehicle, excluding a taxi cab used in an
    	
emergency situation, operated by a contract carrier transporting railroad employees in the course of their employment shall be equipped with a readily available first aid kit that contains, as a minimum, the same articles that are required on each train or engine.
    (7) Abandoned Bridges, Crossings, and Other Rail Plant. The Commission shall have authority, after notice and hearing, to order:
        (a) the removal of any abandoned railroad tracks from
    	
roads, streets or other thoroughfares in this State; and
        (b) the removal of abandoned overhead railroad
    	
structures crossing highways, waterways, or railroads.
    The Commission may equitably apportion the cost of such actions between the rail carrier or carriers, public utilities, and the State, county, municipality, township, road district, or other public authority in interest.
    (8) Railroad-Highway Bridge Clearance. A vertical clearance of not less than 23 feet above the top of rail shall be provided for all new or reconstructed highway bridges constructed over a railroad track. The Commission may permit a lesser clearance if it determines that the 23-foot clearance standard cannot be justified based on engineering, operational, and economic conditions.
    (9) Right of Access To Railroad Property.
        (a) A community antenna television company franchised
    	
by a municipality or county pursuant to the Illinois Municipal Code or the Counties Code, respectively, shall not enter upon any real estate or rights-of-way in the possession or control of a railroad subject to the jurisdiction of the Illinois Commerce Commission unless the community antenna television company first complies with the applicable provisions of subparagraph (f) of Section 11-42-11.1 of the Illinois Municipal Code or subparagraph (f) of Section 5-1096 of the Counties Code.
        (b) Notwithstanding any provision of law to the
    	
contrary, this subsection (9) applies to all entries of railroad rights-of-way involving a railroad subject to the jurisdiction of the Illinois Commerce Commission by a community antenna television company and shall govern in the event of any conflict with any other provision of law.
        (c) This subsection (9) applies to any entry upon any
    	
real estate or right-of-way in the possession or control of a railroad subject to the jurisdiction of the Illinois Commerce Commission for the purpose of or in connection with the construction, or installation of a community antenna television company's system or facilities commenced or renewed on or after August 22, 2017 (the effective date of Public Act 100-251).
        (d) Nothing in Public Act 100-251 shall be construed
    	
to prevent a railroad from negotiating other terms and conditions or the resolution of any dispute in relation to an entry upon or right of access as set forth in this subsection (9).
        (e) For purposes of this subsection (9):
        "Broadband service", "cable operator", and "holder"
    	
have the meanings given to those terms under Section 21-201 of the Public Utilities Act.
        "Community antenna television company" includes, in
    	
the case of real estate or rights-of-way in possession of or in control of a railroad, a holder, cable operator, or broadband service provider.
        (f) Beginning on August 22, 2017 (the effective date
    	
of Public Act 100-251), the Transportation Division of the Illinois Commerce Commission shall include in its annual Crossing Safety Improvement Program report a brief description of the number of cases decided by the Illinois Commerce Commission and the number of cases that remain pending before the Illinois Commerce Commission under this subsection (9) for the period covered by the report.

    Sec. 18c-7402. Safety requirements for railroad operations.
    (1) Obstruction of crossings.
        (a) Obstruction of emergency vehicles. Every railroad
    	
shall be operated in such a manner as to minimize obstruction of emergency vehicles at crossings. Where such obstruction occurs and the train crew is aware of the obstruction, the train crew shall immediately take any action, consistent with safe operating procedure, necessary to remove the obstruction. In the Chicago and St. Louis switching districts, every railroad dispatcher or other person responsible for the movement of railroad equipment in a specific area who receives notification that railroad equipment is obstructing the movement of an emergency vehicle at any crossing within such area shall immediately notify the train crew through use of existing communication facilities. Upon notification, the train crew shall take immediate action in accordance with this paragraph.
        (b) Obstruction of highway at grade crossing
    	
prohibited. It is unlawful for a rail carrier to permit any train, railroad car or engine to obstruct public travel at a railroad-highway grade crossing for a period in excess of 10 minutes, except where such train or railroad car is continuously moving or cannot be moved by reason of circumstances over which the rail carrier has no reasonable control.
        In a county with a population of greater than
    	
1,000,000, as determined by the most recent federal census, during the hours of 7:00 a.m. through 9:00 a.m. and 4:00 p.m. through 6:00 p.m. it is unlawful for a rail carrier to permit any single train or railroad car to obstruct public travel at a railroad-highway grade crossing in excess of a total of 10 minutes during a 30 minute period, except where the train or railroad car cannot be moved by reason or circumstances over which the rail carrier has no reasonable control. Under no circumstances will a moving train be stopped for the purposes of issuing a citation related to this Section.
        However, no employee acting under the rules or orders
    	
of the rail carrier or its supervisory personnel may be prosecuted for a violation of this subsection (b).
        (c) Punishment for obstruction of grade crossing. Any
    	
rail carrier violating paragraph (b) of this subsection shall be guilty of a petty offense and fined not less than $200 nor more than $500 if the duration of the obstruction is in excess of 10 minutes but no longer than 15 minutes. If the duration of the obstruction exceeds 15 minutes the violation shall be a business offense and the following fines shall be imposed: if the duration of the obstruction is in excess of 15 minutes but no longer than 20 minutes, the fine shall be $500; if the duration of the obstruction is in excess of 20 minutes but no longer than 25 minutes, the fine shall be $700; if the duration of the obstruction is in excess of 25 minutes, but no longer than 30 minutes, the fine shall be $900; if the duration of the obstruction is in excess of 30 minutes but no longer than 35 minutes, the fine shall be $1,000; if the duration of the obstruction is in excess of 35 minutes, the fine shall be $1,000 plus an additional $500 for each 5 minutes of obstruction in excess of 25 minutes of obstruction.
    (2) Other operational requirements.
        (a) Bell and whistle-crossings. Every rail carrier
    	
shall cause a bell, and a whistle or horn to be placed and kept on each locomotive, and shall cause the same to be rung or sounded by the engineer or fireman, at the distance of at least 1,320 feet, from the place where the railroad crosses or intersects any public highway, and shall be kept ringing or sounding until the highway is reached; provided that at crossings where the Commission shall by order direct, only after a hearing has been held to determine the public is reasonably and sufficiently protected, the rail carrier may be excused from giving warning provided by this paragraph.
        (a-5) The requirements of paragraph (a) of this
    	
subsection (2) regarding ringing a bell and sounding a whistle or horn do not apply at a railroad crossing that has a permanently installed automated audible warning device authorized by the Commission under Section 18c-7402.1 that sounds automatically when an approaching train is at least 1,320 feet from the crossing and that keeps sounding until the lead locomotive has crossed the highway. The engineer or fireman may ring the bell or sound the whistle or horn at a railroad crossing that has a permanently installed audible warning device.
        (b) Speed limits. Each rail carrier shall operate its
    	
trains in compliance with speed limits set by the Commission. The Commission may set train speed limits only where such limits are necessitated by extraordinary circumstances affecting the public safety, and shall maintain such train speed limits in effect only for such time as the extraordinary circumstances prevail.
        The Commission and the Department of Transportation
    	
shall conduct a study of the relation between train speeds and railroad-highway grade crossing safety. The Commission shall report the findings of the study to the General Assembly no later than January 5, 1997.
        (c) Special speed limit; pilot project. The
    	
Commission and the Board of the Commuter Rail Division of the Regional Transportation Authority shall conduct a pilot project in the Village of Fox River Grove, the site of the fatal school bus accident at a railroad crossing on October 25, 1995, in order to improve railroad crossing safety. For this project, the Commission is directed to set the maximum train speed limit for Regional Transportation Authority trains at 50 miles per hour at intersections on that portion of the intrastate rail line located in the Village of Fox River Grove. If the Regional Transportation Authority deliberately fails to comply with this maximum speed limit, then any entity, governmental or otherwise, that provides capital or operational funds to the Regional Transportation Authority shall appropriately reduce or eliminate that funding. The Commission shall report to the Governor and the General Assembly on the results of this pilot project in January 1999, January 2000, and January 2001. The Commission shall also submit a final report on the pilot project to the Governor and the General Assembly in January 2001. The provisions of this subsection (c), other than this sentence, are inoperative after February 1, 2001.
        (d) Freight train crew size. No rail carrier shall
    	
operate or cause to operate a train or light engine used in connection with the movement of freight unless it has an operating crew consisting of at least 2 individuals. The minimum freight train crew size indicated in this subsection (d) shall remain in effect until a federal law or rule encompassing the subject matter has been adopted. The Commission, with respect to freight train crew member size under this subsection (d), has the power to conduct evidentiary hearings, make findings, and issue and enforce orders, including sanctions under Section 18c-1704 of this Chapter. As used in this subsection (d), "train or light engine" does not include trains operated by a hostler service or utility employees.
    (3) Report and investigation of rail accidents.
        (a) Reports. Every rail carrier shall report to the
    	
Commission, by the speediest means possible, whether telephone, telegraph, or otherwise, every accident involving its equipment, track, or other property which resulted in loss of life to any person. In addition, such carriers shall file a written report with the Commission. Reports submitted under this paragraph shall be strictly confidential, shall be specifically prohibited from disclosure, and shall not be admissible in any administrative or judicial proceeding relating to the accidents reported.
        (b) Investigations. The Commission may investigate
    	
all railroad accidents reported to it or of which it acquires knowledge independent of reports made by rail carriers, and shall have the power, consistent with standards and procedures established under the Federal Railroad Safety Act, as amended, to enter such temporary orders as will minimize the risk of future accidents pending notice, hearing, and final action by the Commission.

    Sec. 18c-7402.1. Pilot projects; automated audible warning devices.
    (a) The General Assembly finds and declares that, for the communities of the State that are traversed by railroads, there is a growing need to mitigate train horn noise without compromising the safety of the public. Therefore, after applications are filed and approved by the Commission, the Commission shall authorize pilot projects in the counties of Cook, DuPage, Lake, and Will to test the utility and safety of stationary automated audible warning devices as an alternative to trains having to sound their horns as they approach highway-rail crossings.
    (b) In light of the pending proposed ruling by the Federal Railroad Administration on the use of locomotive horns at all highway-rail crossings across the nation, it is in the best interest of the State for the Commission to expedite the pilot projects in order to contribute data to the federal rulemaking process regarding the possible inclusion of stationary automated warning devices in the counties of Cook, DuPage, Lake, and Will as a safety measure option to the proposed federal rule.
    (c) The Commission shall adopt rules for implementing the pilot projects in the counties of Cook, DuPage, Lake, and Will.

    Sec. 18d-110. The General Assembly finds and declares that commercial vehicle towing service in the State of Illinois fundamentally affects the public interest and public welfare. It is the intent of the General Assembly, in this amendatory Act of the 95th General Assembly, to promote the public interest and the public welfare by requiring similar basic consumer protections and fraud prevention measures that are required of other marketplace participants, including the disclosure of material terms and conditions of the service to consumers before consumers accept the terms and conditions. The General Assembly also intends that the provisions in this amendatory Act of the 95th General Assembly promote safety for all persons and vehicles that travel or otherwise use the public highways of this State. The General Assembly finds that it is in the public interest that persons whose vehicles are towed from the public highways know important basic information, such as where they can retrieve their vehicles and the cost to retrieve their vehicles, so that they can avoid vehicle deterioration and arrange for a prompt repair of the vehicles.

ARTICLE IV. SAVINGS CLAUSE AND EFFECTIVE DATE

    (625 ILCS 5/20-401) (from Ch. 95 1/2, par. 20-401)
    Sec. 20-401. Saving provisions. The repeal of any Act by this Chapter shall not affect any right accrued or liability incurred under said repealed Act to the effective date hereof.
    The provisions of this Act, insofar as they are the same or substantially the same as those of any prior Act, shall be construed as a continuation of said prior Act. Any license, permit, certificate, registration, registration plate or digital registration plate, registration sticker or digital registration sticker, bond, policy of insurance or other instrument or document issued or filed or any deposit made under any such prior Act and still in effect on the effective date of this Act shall, except as otherwise specifically provided in this Act, be deemed the equivalent of a license, permit, certificate, registration, registration plate or digital registration plate, registration sticker or digital registration sticker, bond, policy of insurance, or other instrument or document issued or filed or any deposit made under this Act, and shall continue in effect until its expiration or until suspended, revoked, cancelled or forfeited under this Act.
    Furthermore, when any section of any of the various laws or acts repealed by this Act is amended by an Amendatory Act of the 76th General Assembly, and such amended section becomes law prior to the effective date of this Act, then it is the intent of the General Assembly that the corresponding section of this Code and Act be construed so as to give effect to such amendment as if it were made a part of this Code. Should, however, any such Amendatory Act amend a definition of a word or phrase in an act repealed by this Act, and such becomes law prior to the effective date of this Act, it is the further intent of the General Assembly that the corresponding section of this Code specifically defining such word or phrase be construed so as to give effect to such amendment, and if not specifically defined, that the corresponding section of Chapter 1 of this Code be construed so as to give effect to such amendment. In the event that a new section is added to an act repealed by this Act by an Act of the 76th General Assembly, it is the further intent of the General Assembly that this Code be construed as if such were made a part of this Code.
