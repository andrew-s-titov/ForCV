the county in which the applicant resides or, if the applicant is a resident of a state

or request by mail to have the commission sent to the applicant with a specimen signature  
of the applicant attached to the request. The applicant shall have a record of the  
appointment, and the time when the commission will expire, entered in the records of the  
office of the county clerk. When the applicant appears before the county clerk, the  
applicant shall pay a fee of $5, at which time the county clerk shall then deliver the  
commission to the applicant.

of $10.00, which shall be submitted with the request to the county clerk. The county clerk

     request that your commission be mailed to you. This request must be

     county clerk.  
          Your appointment as a notary is not complete until the commission is recorded  
     with the county clerk. Furthermore, if you do not make arrangements with the  
     clerk for recording and delivery of your commission within 30 days from the date  
     of this letter, the county clerk will return your commission to the Secretary of  
     State. Your commission will be cancelled and your name will be removed from

     State is guilty of official misconduct and may be subject to a fine or  
     imprisonment”.  
     The Secretary of State shall cancel the appointment of all notaries whose  
commissions are returned to his office by the county clerks. No application fee will be  
refunded and no bonding company is required to issue a refund when an appointment is  
cancelled.

4, inclusive of Section 2, other than a person authorized to perform notarial acts by the

character of that person and to his authority to perform the notarial act.   
     (d) The signature and title of the person performing the act are prima facie evidence  
that he is a person with the designated title and that the signature is genuine.

electronic signature of the person authorized to perform that act, and all other information  
required to be included, is attached to or logically associated with the document or

persons with immigration matters have a significant impact on the ability of their clients  
to reside and work within the United States and to establish and maintain stable families  
and business relationships. The General Assembly further finds that that assistance and  
its impact also have a significant effect on the cultural, social, and economic life of the  
State of Illinois and thereby substantially affect the public interest. It is the intent of the  
General Assembly to establish rules of practice and conduct for those individuals to  
promote honesty and fair dealing with residents and to preserve public confidence.  
     (a-5) The following persons are exempt from this Section, provided they prove the  
exemption by a preponderance of the evidence:  
     (1) An attorney licensed to practice law in any state or territory of the United States,

     (2) A legal intern, as described by the rules of the Illinois Supreme Court, employed

under 8 C.F.R. 292.2(a) and employees of those organizations accredited under 8 C.F.R.  
292.2(d).  
     (4) Any organization employing or desiring to employ an alien or nonimmigrant  
alien, where the organization, its employees or its agents provide advice or assistance in  
immigration matters to alien or nonimmigrant alien employees or potential employees  
without compensation from the individuals to whom such advice or assistance is  
provided.  
     Nothing in this Section shall regulate any business to the extent that such regulation is  
prohibited or preempted by State or federal law.  
     All other persons providing or offering to provide immigration assistance service  
shall be subject to this Section.  
     (b) Any person who provides or offers to provide immigration assistance service may  
perform only the following services:

agency forms.  
     (5) Translating documents from a foreign language into English.

representation for a person in an immigration matter.  
     (8) Preparing or arranging for the preparation of photographs and fingerprints.

appropriately performed by such persons in light of the purposes of this Section.

accredited representative filling out immigration forms shall be limited to the maximum  
fees set forth in subsections (a) and (b) of Section 3-104 of the Notary Public Act (5  
ILCS 312/3-104). The maximum fee schedule set forth in subsections (a) and (b) of  
Section 3-104 of the Notary Public Act shall apply to any person that provides or offers  
to provide immigration assistance service performing the services described therein. The  
Attorney General may promulgate rules establishing maximum fees that may be charged  
for any services not described in that subsection. The maximum fees must be reasonable  
in light of the costs of providing those services and the degree of professional skill  
required to provide the services.  
     No person subject to this Act shall charge fees directly or indirectly for referring an  
individual to an attorney or for any immigration matter not authorized by this Article,  
provided that a person may charge a fee for notarizing documents as permitted by the  
Illinois Notary Public Act.

General and submit verification of malpractice insurance or of a surety bond.  
     (d) Except as provided otherwise in this subsection, before providing any assistance  
in an immigration matter a person shall provide the customer with a written contract that  
includes the following:  
     (1) An explanation of the services to be performed.  
     (2) Identification of all compensation and costs to be charged to the customer for the  
services to be performed.  
     (3) A statement that documents submitted in support of an application for  
nonimmigrant, immigrant, or naturalization status may not be retained by the person for  
any purpose, including payment of compensation or costs.

assistance in immigration matters to clients without charge beyond a reasonable fee to  
reimburse the organization ’s or clinic’s reasonable costs relating to providing  
immigration services to that client.  
     (e) Any person who provides or offers immigration assistance service and is not  
exempted from this Section, shall post signs at his or her place of business, setting forth

     (5) Additional information the Attorney General may require by rule.  
     Every person engaged in immigration assistance service who is not an attorney who  
advertises immigration assistance service in a language other than English, whether by  
radio, television, signs, pamphlets, newspapers, or other written communication, with the  
exception of a single desk plaque, shall include in the document, advertisement,  
stationery, letterhead, business card, or other comparable written material the following  
notice in English and the language in which the written communication appears. This  
notice shall be of a conspicuous size, if in writing, and shall state: “I AM NOT AN  
ATTORNEY LICENSED TO PRACTICE LAW IN ILLINOIS AND MAY NOT GIVE  
LEGAL ADVICE OR ACCEPT FEES FOR LEGAL ADVICE.” If such advertisement is  
by radio or television, the statement may be modified but must include substantially the  
same message.  
    Any person who provides or offers immigration assistance service and is not  
exempted from this Section shall not, in any document, advertisement, stationery,  
letterhead, business card, or other comparable written material, literally translate from  
English into another language terms or titles including, but not limited to, notary public,  
notary, licensed, attorney, lawyer, or any other term that implies the person is an attorney.  
To illustrate, the words “notario” and “poder notarial” are prohibited under this provision.  
     If not subject to penalties under subsection (a) of Section 3-103 of the Notary Public

special influence with the United States Immigration and Naturalization Service or any  
other government agency.

     (3) Refuse to return documents supplied by, prepared on behalf of, or paid for by the  
customer upon the request of the customer. These documents must be returned upon  
request even if there is a fee dispute between the immigration assistant and the customer.  
     (4) Represent or advertise, in connection with the provision assistance in immigration  
matters, other titles of credentials, including but not limited to “notary public” or  
“immigration consultant,” that could cause a customer to believe that the person  
possesses special professional skills or is authorized to provide advice on an immigration  
matter; provided that a notary public appointed by the Illinois Secretary of State may use  
the term “notary public” if the use is accompanied by the statement that the person is not  
an attorney; the term “notary public” may not be translated to another language; for  
example “notario” is prohibited.  
     (5) Provide legal advice, recommend a specific course of legal action, or provide any  
other assistance that requires legal analysis, legal judgment, or interpretation of the law.  
     (6) Make any misrepresentation of false statement, directly or indirectly, to influence,  
persuade, or induce patronage.  
     (k) (Blank)  
     (l) (Blank)  
     (m) Any person who violates any provision of this Section, or the rules and  
regulations issued under this Section, shall be guilty of a Class A misdemeanor for a first  
offense and a Class 3 felony for a second or subsequent offense committed within 5 years  
of a previous conviction for the same offense.  
     Upon his own information or upon the complaint of any person, the Attorney General  
or any State’s Attorney, or a municipality with a population of more than 1,000,000, may  
maintain an action for injunctive relief and also seek a civil penalty not exceeding  
$50,000 in the circuit court against any person who violates any provision of this Section.  
These remedies are in addition to, and not in substitution for, other available remedies.  
     If the Attorney General or any State’s Attorney or a municipality with a population of  
more than 1,000,000 fails to bring an action as provided under this Section any person  
may file a civil action to enforce the provisions of this Article and maintain an action for  
injunctive relief, for compensatory damages to recover prohibited fees, or for such  
additional relief as may be appropriate to deter, prevent, or compensate for the violation.  
In order to deter violations of this Section, courts shall not require a showing of the  
traditional elements for equitable relief. A prevailing plaintiff may be awarded 3 times  
the prohibited fees or a minimum of $1,000 in punitive damages, attorney’s fees, and  
costs of bringing an action under this Section. It is the express intention of the General  
Assembly that remedies for violation of this Section be cumulative.  
     (n) No unit of local government, including any home rule unit, shall have the  
authority to regulate immigration assistance services unless such regulations are at least  
as stringent as those contained in this amendatory Act of 1992. It is declared to be the law  
of this State, pursuant to paragraph (i) of Section 6 of Article VII of the Illinois  
Constitution of 1970, that this amendatory Act of 1992 is a limitation on the authority of  
a home rule unit to exercise powers concurrently with the State. The limitations of this  
Section do not apply to a home rule unit that has, prior to the effective date of this  
amendatory Act, adopted an ordinance regulating immigration assistance services.  
     (o) This Section is severable under Section 1.31 of the Statute on Statutes.

implementation, administration, and enforcement of this Section. The rules may provide
