    The State Commission shall have the power to appoint investigators to conduct investigations, searches, seizures, arrests, and other duties required to enforce the provisions of this Act, on behalf of the State Commission, and to ensure the health, safety, and welfare of the People of the State of Illinois. The Commission's investigators are peace officers and have all the powers possessed by police officers in cities and by sheriffs. State Commission investigators may exercise these powers throughout the State whenever enforcing the provisions of this Act, subject to the rules and orders of the State Commission. No State Commission investigator may have peace officer status or may exercise police powers unless: (1) he or she successfully completes the basic police training course mandated and approved by the Illinois Law Enforcement Training Standards Board; or (2) the Illinois Law Enforcement Training Standards Board waives the training requirement by reason of the investigator's prior law enforcement experience, training, or both.
    The Executive Director must authorize to each investigator of the State Commission and to any other employee of the Department exercising the powers of a peace officer a distinct badge that, on its face: (1) clearly states that the badge is authorized by the State Commission; and (2) contains a unique identifying number. No other badge shall be authorized by the State Commission. Nothing in this Section prohibits the Executive Director from issuing shields or other distinctive identification to employees performing security or regulatory duties who are not peace officers if the Executive Director determines that a shield or distinctive identification is needed by the employee to carry out his or her responsibilities.

    (235 ILCS 5/3-12)
    (Text of Section from P.A. 101-37)
    Sec. 3-12. Powers and duties of State Commission.
    (a) The State Commission shall have the following powers, functions, and duties:
        (1) To receive applications and to issue licenses to
    	
manufacturers, foreign importers, importing distributors, distributors, non-resident dealers, on premise consumption retailers, off premise sale retailers, special event retailer licensees, special use permit licenses, auction liquor licenses, brew pubs, caterer retailers, non-beverage users, railroads, including owners and lessees of sleeping, dining and cafe cars, airplanes, boats, brokers, and wine maker's premises licensees in accordance with the provisions of this Act, and to suspend or revoke such licenses upon the State Commission's determination, upon notice after hearing, that a licensee has violated any provision of this Act or any rule or regulation issued pursuant thereto and in effect for 30 days prior to such violation. Except in the case of an action taken pursuant to a violation of Section 6-3, 6-5, or 6-9, any action by the State Commission to suspend or revoke a licensee's license may be limited to the license for the specific premises where the violation occurred. An action for a violation of this Act shall be commenced by the State Commission within 2 years after the date the State Commission becomes aware of the violation.
        In lieu of suspending or revoking a license, the
    	
commission may impose a fine, upon the State Commission's determination and notice after hearing, that a licensee has violated any provision of this Act or any rule or regulation issued pursuant thereto and in effect for 30 days prior to such violation.
        For the purpose of this paragraph (1), when
    	
determining multiple violations for the sale of alcohol to a person under the age of 21, a second or subsequent violation for the sale of alcohol to a person under the age of 21 shall only be considered if it was committed within 5 years after the date when a prior violation for the sale of alcohol to a person under the age of 21 was committed.
        The fine imposed under this paragraph may not exceed
    	
$500 for each violation. Each day that the activity, which gave rise to the original fine, continues is a separate violation. The maximum fine that may be levied against any licensee, for the period of the license, shall not exceed $20,000. The maximum penalty that may be imposed on a licensee for selling a bottle of alcoholic liquor with a foreign object in it or serving from a bottle of alcoholic liquor with a foreign object in it shall be the destruction of that bottle of alcoholic liquor for the first 10 bottles so sold or served from by the licensee. For the eleventh bottle of alcoholic liquor and for each third bottle thereafter sold or served from by the licensee with a foreign object in it, the maximum penalty that may be imposed on the licensee is the destruction of the bottle of alcoholic liquor and a fine of up to $50.
        Any notice issued by the State Commission to a
    	
licensee for a violation of this Act or any notice with respect to settlement or offer in compromise shall include the field report, photographs, and any other supporting documentation necessary to reasonably inform the licensee of the nature and extent of the violation or the conduct alleged to have occurred. The failure to include such required documentation shall result in the dismissal of the action.
        (2) To adopt such rules and regulations consistent
    	
with the provisions of this Act which shall be necessary to carry on its functions and duties to the end that the health, safety and welfare of the People of the State of Illinois shall be protected and temperance in the consumption of alcoholic liquors shall be fostered and promoted and to distribute copies of such rules and regulations to all licensees affected thereby.
        (3) To call upon other administrative departments of
    	
the State, county and municipal governments, county and city police departments and upon prosecuting officers for such information and assistance as it deems necessary in the performance of its duties.
        (4) To recommend to local commissioners rules and
    	
regulations, not inconsistent with the law, for the distribution and sale of alcoholic liquors throughout the State.
        (5) To inspect, or cause to be inspected, any
    	
premises in this State where alcoholic liquors are manufactured, distributed, warehoused, or sold. Nothing in this Act authorizes an agent of the State Commission to inspect private areas within the premises without reasonable suspicion or a warrant during an inspection. "Private areas" include, but are not limited to, safes, personal property, and closed desks.
        (5.1) Upon receipt of a complaint or upon having
    	
knowledge that any person is engaged in business as a manufacturer, importing distributor, distributor, or retailer without a license or valid license, to conduct an investigation. If, after conducting an investigation, the State Commission is satisfied that the alleged conduct occurred or is occurring, it may issue a cease and desist notice as provided in this Act, impose civil penalties as provided in this Act, notify the local liquor authority, or file a complaint with the State's Attorney's Office of the county where the incident occurred or the Attorney General.
        (5.2) Upon receipt of a complaint or upon having
    	
knowledge that any person is shipping alcoholic liquor into this State from a point outside of this State if the shipment is in violation of this Act, to conduct an investigation. If, after conducting an investigation, the State Commission is satisfied that the alleged conduct occurred or is occurring, it may issue a cease and desist notice as provided in this Act, impose civil penalties as provided in this Act, notify the foreign jurisdiction, or file a complaint with the State's Attorney's Office of the county where the incident occurred or the Attorney General.
        (5.3) To receive complaints from licensees, local
    	
officials, law enforcement agencies, organizations, and persons stating that any licensee has been or is violating any provision of this Act or the rules and regulations issued pursuant to this Act. Such complaints shall be in writing, signed and sworn to by the person making the complaint, and shall state with specificity the facts in relation to the alleged violation. If the State Commission has reasonable grounds to believe that the complaint substantially alleges a violation of this Act or rules and regulations adopted pursuant to this Act, it shall conduct an investigation. If, after conducting an investigation, the State Commission is satisfied that the alleged violation did occur, it shall proceed with disciplinary action against the licensee as provided in this Act.
        (5.4) To make arrests and issue notices of civil
    	
violations where necessary for the enforcement of this Act.
        (5.5) To investigate any and all unlicensed activity.
        (5.6) To impose civil penalties or fines to any
    	
person who, without holding a valid license, engages in conduct that requires a license pursuant to this Act, in an amount not to exceed $20,000 for each offense as determined by the State Commission. A civil penalty shall be assessed by the State Commission after a hearing is held in accordance with the provisions set forth in this Act regarding the provision of a hearing for the revocation or suspension of a license.
        (6) To hear and determine appeals from orders of a
    	
local commission in accordance with the provisions of this Act, as hereinafter set forth. Hearings under this subsection shall be held in Springfield or Chicago, at whichever location is the more convenient for the majority of persons who are parties to the hearing.
        (7) The State Commission shall establish uniform
    	
systems of accounts to be kept by all retail licensees having more than 4 employees, and for this purpose the State Commission may classify all retail licensees having more than 4 employees and establish a uniform system of accounts for each class and prescribe the manner in which such accounts shall be kept. The State Commission may also prescribe the forms of accounts to be kept by all retail licensees having more than 4 employees, including but not limited to accounts of earnings and expenses and any distribution, payment, or other distribution of earnings or assets, and any other forms, records and memoranda which in the judgment of the commission may be necessary or appropriate to carry out any of the provisions of this Act, including but not limited to such forms, records and memoranda as will readily and accurately disclose at all times the beneficial ownership of such retail licensed business. The accounts, forms, records and memoranda shall be available at all reasonable times for inspection by authorized representatives of the State Commission or by any local liquor control commissioner or his or her authorized representative. The commission, may, from time to time, alter, amend or repeal, in whole or in part, any uniform system of accounts, or the form and manner of keeping accounts.
        (8) In the conduct of any hearing authorized to be
    	
held by the State Commission, to appoint, at the commission's discretion, hearing officers to conduct hearings involving complex issues or issues that will require a protracted period of time to resolve, to examine, or cause to be examined, under oath, any licensee, and to examine or cause to be examined the books and records of such licensee; to hear testimony and take proof material for its information in the discharge of its duties hereunder; to administer or cause to be administered oaths; for any such purpose to issue subpoena or subpoenas to require the attendance of witnesses and the production of books, which shall be effective in any part of this State, and to adopt rules to implement its powers under this paragraph (8).
        Any circuit court may by order duly entered, require
    	
the attendance of witnesses and the production of relevant books subpoenaed by the State Commission and the court may compel obedience to its order by proceedings for contempt.
        (9) To investigate the administration of laws in
    	
relation to alcoholic liquors in this and other states and any foreign countries, and to recommend from time to time to the Governor and through him or her to the legislature of this State, such amendments to this Act, if any, as it may think desirable and as will serve to further the general broad purposes contained in Section 1-2 hereof.
        (10) To adopt such rules and regulations consistent
    	
with the provisions of this Act which shall be necessary for the control, sale or disposition of alcoholic liquor damaged as a result of an accident, wreck, flood, fire or other similar occurrence.
        (11) To develop industry educational programs related
    	
to responsible serving and selling, particularly in the areas of overserving consumers and illegal underage purchasing and consumption of alcoholic beverages.
        (11.1) To license persons providing education and
    	
training to alcohol beverage sellers and servers for mandatory and non-mandatory training under the Beverage Alcohol Sellers and Servers Education and Training (BASSET) programs and to develop and administer a public awareness program in Illinois to reduce or eliminate the illegal purchase and consumption of alcoholic beverage products by persons under the age of 21. Application for a license shall be made on forms provided by the State Commission.
        (12) To develop and maintain a repository of license
    	
and regulatory information.
        (13) (Blank).
        (14) On or before April 30, 2008 and every 2 years
    	
thereafter, the State Commission shall present a written report to the Governor and the General Assembly that shall be based on a study of the impact of Public Act 95-634 on the business of soliciting, selling, and shipping wine from inside and outside of this State directly to residents of this State. As part of its report, the State Commission shall provide all of the following information:
            (A) The amount of State excise and sales tax
        	
revenues generated.
            (B) The amount of licensing fees received.
            (C) The number of cases of wine shipped from
        	
inside and outside of this State directly to residents of this State.
            (D) The number of alcohol compliance operations
        	
conducted.
            (E) The number of winery shipper's licenses
        	
issued.
            (F) The number of each of the following: reported
        	
violations; cease and desist notices issued by the Commission; notices of violations issued by the Commission and to the Department of Revenue; and notices and complaints of violations to law enforcement officials, including, without limitation, the Illinois Attorney General and the U.S. Department of Treasury's Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau.
        (15) As a means to reduce the underage consumption of
    	
alcoholic liquors, the State Commission shall conduct alcohol compliance operations to investigate whether businesses that are soliciting, selling, and shipping wine from inside or outside of this State directly to residents of this State are licensed by this State or are selling or attempting to sell wine to persons under 21 years of age in violation of this Act.
        (16) The State Commission shall, in addition to
    	
notifying any appropriate law enforcement agency, submit notices of complaints or violations of Sections 6-29 and 6-29.1 by persons who do not hold a winery shipper's license under this Act to the Illinois Attorney General and to the U.S. Department of Treasury's Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau.
        (17)(A) A person licensed to make wine under the laws
    	
of another state who has a winery shipper's license under this Act and annually produces less than 25,000 gallons of wine or a person who has a first-class or second-class wine manufacturer's license, a first-class or second-class wine-maker's license, or a limited wine manufacturer's license under this Act and annually produces less than 25,000 gallons of wine may make application to the Commission for a self-distribution exemption to allow the sale of not more than 5,000 gallons of the exemption holder's wine to retail licensees per year.
        (B) In the application, which shall be sworn under
    	
penalty of perjury, such person shall state (1) the date it was established; (2) its volume of production and sales for each year since its establishment; (3) its efforts to establish distributor relationships; (4) that a self-distribution exemption is necessary to facilitate the marketing of its wine; and (5) that it will comply with the liquor and revenue laws of the United States, this State, and any other state where it is licensed.
        (C) The State Commission shall approve the
    	
application for a self-distribution exemption if such person: (1) is in compliance with State revenue and liquor laws; (2) is not a member of any affiliated group that produces more than 25,000 gallons of wine per annum or produces any other alcoholic liquor; (3) will not annually produce for sale more than 25,000 gallons of wine; and (4) will not annually sell more than 5,000 gallons of its wine to retail licensees.
        (D) A self-distribution exemption holder shall
    	
annually certify to the State Commission its production of wine in the previous 12 months and its anticipated production and sales for the next 12 months. The State Commission may fine, suspend, or revoke a self-distribution exemption after a hearing if it finds that the exemption holder has made a material misrepresentation in its application, violated a revenue or liquor law of Illinois, exceeded production of 25,000 gallons of wine in any calendar year, or become part of an affiliated group producing more than 25,000 gallons of wine or any other alcoholic liquor.
        (E) Except in hearings for violations of this Act or
    	
Public Act 95-634 or a bona fide investigation by duly sworn law enforcement officials, the State Commission, or its agents, the State Commission shall maintain the production and sales information of a self-distribution exemption holder as confidential and shall not release such information to any person.
        (F) The State Commission shall issue regulations
    	
governing self-distribution exemptions consistent with this Section and this Act.
        (G) Nothing in this paragraph (17) shall prohibit a
    	
self-distribution exemption holder from entering into or simultaneously having a distribution agreement with a licensed Illinois distributor.
        (H) It is the intent of this paragraph (17) to
    	
promote and continue orderly markets. The General Assembly finds that in order to preserve Illinois' regulatory distribution system it is necessary to create an exception for smaller makers of wine as their wines are frequently adjusted in varietals, mixes, vintages, and taste to find and create market niches sometimes too small for distributor or importing distributor business strategies. Limited self-distribution rights will afford and allow smaller makers of wine access to the marketplace in order to develop a customer base without impairing the integrity of the 3-tier system.
        (18)(A) A class 1 brewer licensee, who must also be
    	
either a licensed brewer or licensed non-resident dealer and annually manufacture less than 930,000 gallons of beer, may make application to the State Commission for a self-distribution exemption to allow the sale of not more than 232,500 gallons of the exemption holder's beer per year to retail licensees and to brewers, class 1 brewers, and class 2 brewers that, pursuant to subsection (e) of Section 6-4 of this Act, sell beer, cider, or both beer and cider to non-licensees at their breweries.
        (B) In the application, which shall be sworn under
    	
penalty of perjury, the class 1 brewer licensee shall state (1) the date it was established; (2) its volume of beer manufactured and sold for each year since its establishment; (3) its efforts to establish distributor relationships; (4) that a self-distribution exemption is necessary to facilitate the marketing of its beer; and (5) that it will comply with the alcoholic beverage and revenue laws of the United States, this State, and any other state where it is licensed.
        (C) Any application submitted shall be posted on the
    	
State Commission's website at least 45 days prior to action by the State Commission. The State Commission shall approve the application for a self-distribution exemption if the class 1 brewer licensee: (1) is in compliance with the State, revenue, and alcoholic beverage laws; (2) is not a member of any affiliated group that manufactures more than 930,000 gallons of beer per annum or produces any other alcoholic beverages; (3) shall not annually manufacture for sale more than 930,000 gallons of beer; (4) shall not annually sell more than 232,500 gallons of its beer to retail licensees or to brewers, class 1 brewers, and class 2 brewers that, pursuant to subsection (e) of Section 6-4 of this Act, sell beer, cider, or both beer and cider to non-licensees at their breweries; and (5) has relinquished any brew pub license held by the licensee, including any ownership interest it held in the licensed brew pub.
        (D) A self-distribution exemption holder shall
    	
annually certify to the State Commission its manufacture of beer during the previous 12 months and its anticipated manufacture and sales of beer for the next 12 months. The State Commission may fine, suspend, or revoke a self-distribution exemption after a hearing if it finds that the exemption holder has made a material misrepresentation in its application, violated a revenue or alcoholic beverage law of Illinois, exceeded the manufacture of 930,000 gallons of beer in any calendar year or became part of an affiliated group manufacturing more than 930,000 gallons of beer or any other alcoholic beverage.
        (E) The State Commission shall issue rules and
    	
regulations governing self-distribution exemptions consistent with this Act.
        (F) Nothing in this paragraph (18) shall prohibit a
    	
self-distribution exemption holder from entering into or simultaneously having a distribution agreement with a licensed Illinois importing distributor or a distributor. If a self-distribution exemption holder enters into a distribution agreement and has assigned distribution rights to an importing distributor or distributor, then the self-distribution exemption holder's distribution rights in the assigned territories shall cease in a reasonable time not to exceed 60 days.
        (G) It is the intent of this paragraph (18) to
    	
promote and continue orderly markets. The General Assembly finds that in order to preserve Illinois' regulatory distribution system, it is necessary to create an exception for smaller manufacturers in order to afford and allow such smaller manufacturers of beer access to the marketplace in order to develop a customer base without impairing the integrity of the 3-tier system.
    (b) On or before April 30, 1999, the Commission shall present a written report to the Governor and the General Assembly that shall be based on a study of the impact of Public Act 90-739 on the business of soliciting, selling, and shipping alcoholic liquor from outside of this State directly to residents of this State.
    As part of its report, the Commission shall provide the following information:
        (i) the amount of State excise and sales tax revenues
    	
generated as a result of Public Act 90-739;
        (ii) the amount of licensing fees received as a
    	
result of Public Act 90-739;
        (iii) the number of reported violations, the number
    	
of cease and desist notices issued by the Commission, the number of notices of violations issued to the Department of Revenue, and the number of notices and complaints of violations to law enforcement officials.

Except in the case of an action taken pursuant to a violation of Section 6-3, 6-5, or 6-9, any action by the State Commission to suspend or revoke a licensee's license may be limited to the license for the specific premises where the violation occurred. An action for a violation of this Act shall be commenced by the State Commission within 2 years after the date the State Commission becomes aware of the violation.
        In lieu of suspending or revoking a license, the
    	
commission may impose a fine, upon the State Commission's determination and notice after hearing, that a licensee has violated any provision of this Act or any rule or regulation issued pursuant thereto and in effect for 30 days prior to such violation.
        For the purpose of this paragraph (1), when
    	
determining multiple violations for the sale of alcohol to a person under the age of 21, a second or subsequent violation for the sale of alcohol to a person under the age of 21 shall only be considered if it was committed within 5 years after the date when a prior violation for the sale of alcohol to a person under the age of 21 was committed.
        The fine imposed under this paragraph may not exceed
    	
$500 for each violation. Each day that the activity, which gave rise to the original fine, continues is a separate violation. The maximum fine that may be levied against any licensee, for the period of the license, shall not exceed $20,000. The maximum penalty that may be imposed on a licensee for selling a bottle of alcoholic liquor with a foreign object in it or serving from a bottle of alcoholic liquor with a foreign object in it shall be the destruction of that bottle of alcoholic liquor for the first 10 bottles so sold or served from by the licensee. For the eleventh bottle of alcoholic liquor and for each third bottle thereafter sold or served from by the licensee with a foreign object in it, the maximum penalty that may be imposed on the licensee is the destruction of the bottle of alcoholic liquor and a fine of up to $50.
        Any notice issued by the State Commission to a
    	
licensee for a violation of this Act or any notice with respect to settlement or offer in compromise shall include the field report, photographs, and any other supporting documentation necessary to reasonably inform the licensee of the nature and extent of the violation or the conduct alleged to have occurred. The failure to include such required documentation shall result in the dismissal of the action.
        (2) To adopt such rules and regulations consistent
    	
with the provisions of this Act which shall be necessary to carry on its functions and duties to the end that the health, safety and welfare of the People of the State of Illinois shall be protected and temperance in the consumption of alcoholic liquors shall be fostered and promoted and to distribute copies of such rules and regulations to all licensees affected thereby.
        (3) To call upon other administrative departments of
    	
the State, county and municipal governments, county and city police departments and upon prosecuting officers for such information and assistance as it deems necessary in the performance of its duties.

regulations, not inconsistent with the law, for the distribution and sale of alcoholic liquors throughout the State.
        (5) To inspect, or cause to be inspected, any
    	
premises in this State where alcoholic liquors are manufactured, distributed, warehoused, or sold. Nothing in this Act authorizes an agent of the Commission to inspect private areas within the premises without reasonable suspicion or a warrant during an inspection. "Private areas" include, but are not limited to, safes, personal property, and closed desks.
        (5.1) Upon receipt of a complaint or upon having
    	
knowledge that any person is engaged in business as a manufacturer, importing distributor, distributor, or retailer without a license or valid license, to notify the local liquor authority, file a complaint with the State's Attorney's Office of the county where the incident occurred, or initiate an investigation with the appropriate law enforcement officials.

        (5.3) To receive complaints from licensees, local
    	
officials, law enforcement agencies, organizations, and persons stating that any licensee has been or is violating any provision of this Act or the rules and regulations issued pursuant to this Act. Such complaints shall be in writing, signed and sworn to by the person making the complaint, and shall state with specificity the facts in relation to the alleged violation. If the Commission has reasonable grounds to believe that the complaint substantially alleges a violation of this Act or rules and regulations adopted pursuant to this Act, it shall conduct an investigation. If, after conducting an investigation, the Commission is satisfied that the alleged violation did occur, it shall proceed with disciplinary action against the licensee as provided in this Act.
        (6) To hear and determine appeals from orders of a
    	
local commission in accordance with the provisions of this Act, as hereinafter set forth. Hearings under this subsection shall be held in Springfield or Chicago, at whichever location is the more convenient for the majority of persons who are parties to the hearing.
        (7) The commission shall establish uniform systems of
    	
accounts to be kept by all retail licensees having more than 4 employees, and for this purpose the commission may classify all retail licensees having more than 4 employees and establish a uniform system of accounts for each class and prescribe the manner in which such accounts shall be kept. The commission may also prescribe the forms of accounts to be kept by all retail licensees having more than 4 employees, including but not limited to accounts of earnings and expenses and any distribution, payment, or other distribution of earnings or assets, and any other forms, records and memoranda which in the judgment of the commission may be necessary or appropriate to carry out any of the provisions of this Act, including but not limited to such forms, records and memoranda as will readily and accurately disclose at all times the beneficial ownership of such retail licensed business. The accounts, forms, records and memoranda shall be available at all reasonable times for inspection by authorized representatives of the State Commission or by any local liquor control commissioner or his or her authorized representative. The commission, may, from time to time, alter, amend or repeal, in whole or in part, any uniform system of accounts, or the form and manner of keeping accounts.
        (8) In the conduct of any hearing authorized to be
    	
held by the commission, to appoint, at the commission's discretion, hearing officers to conduct hearings involving complex issues or issues that will require a protracted period of time to resolve, to examine, or cause to be examined, under oath, any licensee, and to examine or cause to be examined the books and records of such licensee; to hear testimony and take proof material for its information in the discharge of its duties hereunder; to administer or cause to be administered oaths; for any such purpose to issue subpoena or subpoenas to require the attendance of witnesses and the production of books, which shall be effective in any part of this State, and to adopt rules to implement its powers under this paragraph (8).

relation to alcoholic liquors in this and other states and any foreign countries, and to recommend from time to time to the Governor and through him or her to the legislature of this State, such amendments to this Act, if any, as it may think desirable and as will serve to further the general broad purposes contained in Section 1-2 hereof.
        (10) To adopt such rules and regulations consistent
    	
with the provisions of this Act which shall be necessary for the control, sale or disposition of alcoholic liquor damaged as a result of an accident, wreck, flood, fire or other similar occurrence.

to responsible serving and selling, particularly in the areas of overserving consumers and illegal underage purchasing and consumption of alcoholic beverages.
        (11.1) To license persons providing education and
    	
training to alcohol beverage sellers and servers for mandatory and non-mandatory training under the Beverage Alcohol Sellers and Servers Education and Training (BASSET) programs and to develop and administer a public awareness program in Illinois to reduce or eliminate the illegal purchase and consumption of alcoholic beverage products by persons under the age of 21.

        (13) (Blank).
        (14) On or before April 30, 2008 and every 2 years
    	
thereafter, the Commission shall present a written report to the Governor and the General Assembly that shall be based on a study of the impact of Public Act 95-634 on the business of soliciting, selling, and shipping wine from inside and outside of this State directly to residents of this State. As part of its report, the Commission shall provide all of the following information:
            (A) The amount of State excise and sales tax
        	
revenues generated.
            (B) The amount of licensing fees received.
            (C) The number of cases of wine shipped from
        	
inside and outside of this State directly to residents of this State.
            (D) The number of alcohol compliance operations
        	
conducted.
            (E) The number of winery shipper's licenses
        	
issued.
            (F) The number of each of the following: reported
        	
violations; cease and desist notices issued by the Commission; notices of violations issued by the Commission and to the Department of Revenue; and notices and complaints of violations to law enforcement officials, including, without limitation, the Illinois Attorney General and the U.S. Department of Treasury's Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau.
        (15) As a means to reduce the underage consumption of
    	
alcoholic liquors, the Commission shall conduct alcohol compliance operations to investigate whether businesses that are soliciting, selling, and shipping wine from inside or outside of this State directly to residents of this State are licensed by this State or are selling or attempting to sell wine to persons under 21 years of age in violation of this Act.
        (16) The Commission shall, in addition to
    	
notifying any appropriate law enforcement agency, submit notices of complaints or violations of Sections 6-29 and 6-29.1 by persons who do not hold a winery shipper's license under this Act to the Illinois Attorney General and to the U.S. Department of Treasury's Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau.
        (17)(A) A person licensed to make wine under the laws
    	
of another state who has a winery shipper's license under this Act and annually produces less than 25,000 gallons of wine or a person who has a first-class or second-class wine manufacturer's license, a first-class or second-class wine-maker's license, or a limited wine manufacturer's license under this Act and annually produces less than 25,000 gallons of wine may make application to the Commission for a self-distribution exemption to allow the sale of not more than 5,000 gallons of the exemption holder's wine to retail licensees per year.
        (B) In the application, which shall be sworn under
    	
penalty of perjury, such person shall state (1) the date it was established; (2) its volume of production and sales for each year since its establishment; (3) its efforts to establish distributor relationships; (4) that a self-distribution exemption is necessary to facilitate the marketing of its wine; and (5) that it will comply with the liquor and revenue laws of the United States, this State, and any other state where it is licensed.
        (C) The Commission shall approve the application for
    	
a self-distribution exemption if such person: (1) is in compliance with State revenue and liquor laws; (2) is not a member of any affiliated group that produces more than 25,000 gallons of wine per annum or produces any other alcoholic liquor; (3) will not annually produce for sale more than 25,000 gallons of wine; and (4) will not annually sell more than 5,000 gallons of its wine to retail licensees.
        (D) A self-distribution exemption holder shall
    	
annually certify to the Commission its production of wine in the previous 12 months and its anticipated production and sales for the next 12 months. The Commission may fine, suspend, or revoke a self-distribution exemption after a hearing if it finds that the exemption holder has made a material misrepresentation in its application, violated a revenue or liquor law of Illinois, exceeded production of 25,000 gallons of wine in any calendar year, or become part of an affiliated group producing more than 25,000 gallons of wine or any other alcoholic liquor.
        (E) Except in hearings for violations of this Act or
    	
Public Act 95-634 or a bona fide investigation by duly sworn law enforcement officials, the Commission, or its agents, the Commission shall maintain the production and sales information of a self-distribution exemption holder as confidential and shall not release such information to any person.
        (F) The Commission shall issue regulations governing
    	
self-distribution exemptions consistent with this Section and this Act.
        (G) Nothing in this paragraph (17) shall prohibit a
    	
self-distribution exemption holder from entering into or simultaneously having a distribution agreement with a licensed Illinois distributor.
        (H) It is the intent of this paragraph (17) to
    	
promote and continue orderly markets. The General Assembly finds that in order to preserve Illinois' regulatory distribution system it is necessary to create an exception for smaller makers of wine as their wines are frequently adjusted in varietals, mixes, vintages, and taste to find and create market niches sometimes too small for distributor or importing distributor business strategies. Limited self-distribution rights will afford and allow smaller makers of wine access to the marketplace in order to develop a customer base without impairing the integrity of the 3-tier system.
        (18)(A) A class 1 brewer licensee, who must also be
    	
either a licensed brewer or licensed non-resident dealer and annually manufacture less than 930,000 gallons of beer, may make application to the State Commission for a self-distribution exemption to allow the sale of not more than 232,500 gallons of the exemption holder's beer per year to retail licensees and to brewers, class 1 brewers, and class 2 brewers that, pursuant to subsection (e) of Section 6-4 of this Act, sell beer, cider, or both beer and cider to non-licensees at their breweries.
        (B) In the application, which shall be sworn under
    	
penalty of perjury, the class 1 brewer licensee shall state (1) the date it was established; (2) its volume of beer manufactured and sold for each year since its establishment; (3) its efforts to establish distributor relationships; (4) that a self-distribution exemption is necessary to facilitate the marketing of its beer; and (5) that it will comply with the alcoholic beverage and revenue laws of the United States, this State, and any other state where it is licensed.
        (C) Any application submitted shall be posted on the
    	
State Commission's website at least 45 days prior to action by the State Commission. The State Commission shall approve the application for a self-distribution exemption if the class 1 brewer licensee: (1) is in compliance with the State, revenue, and alcoholic beverage laws; (2) is not a member of any affiliated group that manufactures more than 930,000 gallons of beer per annum or produces any other alcoholic beverages; (3) shall not annually manufacture for sale more than 930,000 gallons of beer; (4) shall not annually sell more than 232,500 gallons of its beer to retail licensees or to brewers, class 1 brewers, and class 2 brewers that, pursuant to subsection (e) of Section 6-4 of this Act, sell beer, cider, or both beer and cider to non-licensees at their breweries; and (5) has relinquished any brew pub license held by the licensee, including any ownership interest it held in the licensed brew pub.
        (D) A self-distribution exemption holder shall
    	
annually certify to the State Commission its manufacture of beer during the previous 12 months and its anticipated manufacture and sales of beer for the next 12 months. The State Commission may fine, suspend, or revoke a self-distribution exemption after a hearing if it finds that the exemption holder has made a material misrepresentation in its application, violated a revenue or alcoholic beverage law of Illinois, exceeded the manufacture of 930,000 gallons of beer in any calendar year or became part of an affiliated group manufacturing more than 930,000 gallons of beer or any other alcoholic beverage.
        (E) The State Commission shall issue rules and
    	
regulations governing self-distribution exemptions consistent with this Act.
        (F) Nothing in this paragraph (18) shall prohibit a
    	
self-distribution exemption holder from entering into or simultaneously having a distribution agreement with a licensed Illinois importing distributor or a distributor. If a self-distribution exemption holder enters into a distribution agreement and has assigned distribution rights to an importing distributor or distributor, then the self-distribution exemption holder's distribution rights in the assigned territories shall cease in a reasonable time not to exceed 60 days.
        (G) It is the intent of this paragraph (18) to
    	
promote and continue orderly markets. The General Assembly finds that in order to preserve Illinois' regulatory distribution system, it is necessary to create an exception for smaller manufacturers in order to afford and allow such smaller manufacturers of beer access to the marketplace in order to develop a customer base without impairing the integrity of the 3-tier system.
    (b) On or before April 30, 1999, the Commission shall present a written report to the Governor and the General Assembly that shall be based on a study of the impact of Public Act 90-739 on the business of soliciting, selling, and shipping alcoholic liquor from outside of this State directly to residents of this State.
    As part of its report, the Commission shall provide the following information:
        (i) the amount of State excise and sales tax revenues
    	
generated as a result of Public Act 90-739;
        (ii) the amount of licensing fees received as a
    	
result of Public Act 90-739;
        (iii) the number of reported violations, the number
    	
of cease and desist notices issued by the Commission, the number of notices of violations issued to the Department of Revenue, and the number of notices and complaints of violations to law enforcement officials.

of another state who has a winery shipper's license under this Act and annually produces less than 25,000 gallons of wine or a person who has a first-class or second-class wine manufacturer's license, a first-class or second-class wine-maker's license, or a limited wine manufacturer's license under this Act and annually produces less than 25,000 gallons of wine may make application to the Commission for a self-distribution exemption to allow the sale of not more than 5,000 gallons of the exemption holder's wine to retail licensees per year.
        (B) In the application, which shall be sworn under
    	
penalty of perjury, such person shall state (1) the date it was established; (2) its volume of production and sales for each year since its establishment; (3) its efforts to establish distributor relationships; (4) that a self-distribution exemption is necessary to facilitate the marketing of its wine; and (5) that it will comply with the liquor and revenue laws of the United States, this State, and any other state where it is licensed.
        (C) The Commission shall approve the application for
    	
a self-distribution exemption if such person: (1) is in compliance with State revenue and liquor laws; (2) is not a member of any affiliated group that produces more than 25,000 gallons of wine per annum or produces any other alcoholic liquor; (3) will not annually produce for sale more than 25,000 gallons of wine; and (4) will not annually sell more than 5,000 gallons of its wine to retail licensees.
        (D) A self-distribution exemption holder shall
    	
annually certify to the Commission its production of wine in the previous 12 months and its anticipated production and sales for the next 12 months. The Commission may fine, suspend, or revoke a self-distribution exemption after a hearing if it finds that the exemption holder has made a material misrepresentation in its application, violated a revenue or liquor law of Illinois, exceeded production of 25,000 gallons of wine in any calendar year, or become part of an affiliated group producing more than 25,000 gallons of wine or any other alcoholic liquor.
        (E) Except in hearings for violations of this Act or
    	
Public Act 95-634 or a bona fide investigation by duly sworn law enforcement officials, the Commission, or its agents, the Commission shall maintain the production and sales information of a self-distribution exemption holder as confidential and shall not release such information to any person.
        (F) The Commission shall issue regulations governing
    	
self-distribution exemptions consistent with this Section and this Act.
        (G) Nothing in this paragraph (17) shall prohibit a
    	
self-distribution exemption holder from entering into or simultaneously having a distribution agreement with a licensed Illinois distributor.
        (H) It is the intent of this paragraph (17) to
    	
promote and continue orderly markets. The General Assembly finds that in order to preserve Illinois' regulatory distribution system it is necessary to create an exception for smaller makers of wine as their wines are frequently adjusted in varietals, mixes, vintages, and taste to find and create market niches sometimes too small for distributor or importing distributor business strategies. Limited self-distribution rights will afford and allow smaller makers of wine access to the marketplace in order to develop a customer base without impairing the integrity of the 3-tier system.
        (18)(A) A class 1 brewer licensee, who must also be
    	
either a licensed brewer or licensed non-resident dealer and annually manufacture less than 930,000 gallons of beer, may make application to the State Commission for a self-distribution exemption to allow the sale of not more than 232,500 gallons of the exemption holder's beer per year to retail licensees and to brewers, class 1 brewers, and class 2 brewers that, pursuant to subsection (e) of Section 6-4 of this Act, sell beer, cider, or both beer and cider to non-licensees at their breweries.
        (B) In the application, which shall be sworn under
    	
penalty of perjury, the class 1 brewer licensee shall state (1) the date it was established; (2) its volume of beer manufactured and sold for each year since its establishment; (3) its efforts to establish distributor relationships; (4) that a self-distribution exemption is necessary to facilitate the marketing of its beer; and (5) that it will comply with the alcoholic beverage and revenue laws of the United States, this State, and any other state where it is licensed.
        (C) Any application submitted shall be posted on the
    	
State Commission's website at least 45 days prior to action by the State Commission. The State Commission shall approve the application for a self-distribution exemption if the class 1 brewer licensee: (1) is in compliance with the State, revenue, and alcoholic beverage laws; (2) is not a member of any affiliated group that manufactures more than 930,000 gallons of beer per annum or produces any other alcoholic beverages; (3) shall not annually manufacture for sale more than 930,000 gallons of beer; (4) shall not annually sell more than 232,500 gallons of its beer to retail licensees or to brewers, class 1 brewers, and class 2 brewers that, pursuant to subsection (e) of Section 6-4 of this Act, sell beer, cider, or both beer and cider to non-licensees at their breweries; and (5) has relinquished any brew pub license held by the licensee, including any ownership interest it held in the licensed brew pub.
        (D) A self-distribution exemption holder shall
    	
annually certify to the State Commission its manufacture of beer during the previous 12 months and its anticipated manufacture and sales of beer for the next 12 months. The State Commission may fine, suspend, or revoke a self-distribution exemption after a hearing if it finds that the exemption holder has made a material misrepresentation in its application, violated a revenue or alcoholic beverage law of Illinois, exceeded the manufacture of 930,000 gallons of beer in any calendar year or became part of an affiliated group manufacturing more than 930,000 gallons of beer or any other alcoholic beverage.
        (E) The State Commission shall issue rules and
    	
regulations governing self-distribution exemptions consistent with this Act.
        (F) Nothing in this paragraph (18) shall prohibit a
    	
self-distribution exemption holder from entering into or simultaneously having a distribution agreement with a licensed Illinois importing distributor or a distributor. If a self-distribution exemption holder enters into a distribution agreement and has assigned distribution rights to an importing distributor or distributor, then the self-distribution exemption holder's distribution rights in the assigned territories shall cease in a reasonable time not to exceed 60 days.
        (G) It is the intent of this paragraph (18) to
    	
promote and continue orderly markets. The General Assembly finds that in order to preserve Illinois' regulatory distribution system, it is necessary to create an exception for smaller manufacturers in order to afford and allow such smaller manufacturers of beer access to the marketplace in order to develop a customer base without impairing the integrity of the 3-tier system.
        (19)(A) A class 1 craft distiller licensee or a
    	
non-resident dealer who manufactures less than 50,000 gallons of distilled spirits per year may make application to the State Commission for a self-distribution exemption to allow the sale of not more than 5,000 gallons of the exemption holder's spirits to retail licensees per year.
        (B) In the application, which shall be sworn under
    	
penalty of perjury, the class 1 craft distiller licensee or non-resident dealer shall state (1) the date it was established; (2) its volume of spirits manufactured and sold for each year since its establishment; (3) its efforts to establish distributor relationships; (4) that a self-distribution exemption is necessary to facilitate the marketing of its spirits; and (5) that it will comply with the alcoholic beverage and revenue laws of the United States, this State, and any other state where it is licensed.
        (C) Any application submitted shall be posted on the
    	
State Commission's website at least 45 days prior to action by the State Commission. The State Commission shall approve the application for a self-distribution exemption if the applicant: (1) is in compliance with State revenue and alcoholic beverage laws; (2) is not a member of any affiliated group that produces more than 50,000 gallons of spirits per annum or produces any other alcoholic liquor; (3) does not annually manufacture for sale more than 50,000 gallons of spirits; and (4) does not annually sell more than 5,000 gallons of its spirits to retail licensees.
        (D) A self-distribution exemption holder shall
    	
annually certify to the State Commission its manufacture of spirits during the previous 12 months and its anticipated manufacture and sales of spirits for the next 12 months. The State Commission may fine, suspend, or revoke a self-distribution exemption after a hearing if it finds that the exemption holder has made a material misrepresentation in its application, violated a revenue or alcoholic beverage law of Illinois, exceeded the manufacture of 50,000 gallons of spirits in any calendar year, or has become part of an affiliated group manufacturing more than 50,000 gallons of spirits or any other alcoholic beverage.
        (E) The State Commission shall adopt rules governing
    	
self-distribution exemptions consistent with this Act.
        (F) Nothing in this paragraph (19) shall prohibit a
    	
self-distribution exemption holder from entering into or simultaneously having a distribution agreement with a licensed Illinois importing distributor or a distributor.
        (G) It is the intent of this paragraph (19) to
    	
promote and continue orderly markets. The General Assembly finds that in order to preserve Illinois' regulatory distribution system, it is necessary to create an exception for smaller manufacturers in order to afford and allow such smaller manufacturers of spirits access to the marketplace in order to develop a customer base without impairing the integrity of the 3-tier system.
    (b) On or before April 30, 1999, the Commission shall present a written report to the Governor and the General Assembly that shall be based on a study of the impact of Public Act 90-739 on the business of soliciting, selling, and shipping alcoholic liquor from outside of this State directly to residents of this State.
    As part of its report, the Commission shall provide the following information:
        (i) the amount of State excise and sales tax revenues
    	
generated as a result of Public Act 90-739;

result of Public Act 90-739;
        (iii) the number of reported violations, the number

Nothing contained in this Act shall, however, be construed to permit the State Commission to issue any license, other than manufacturer's, foreign importer's, importing distributor's, non-resident dealer's, and distributor's, broker's and non-beverage user's license for any premises in any prohibited territory, or to issue any license other than manufacturer's, foreign importer's, importing distributor's, non-resident dealer's, distributor's, railroad's, airplane's, boat's, or broker's license, auction liquor license, or non-beverage user's license, unless the person applying for such license shall have obtained a local license for the same premises. For purposes of this Section and only in regards to a hotel, the local license issued for the same premises may include multiple local licenses issued to a hotel operator for various portions of the hotel building, structure, or adjacent property owned and managed by the hotel operator in which alcoholic liquors may be stored, offered for sale, and sold; however, all of those portions of the hotel building, structure, or adjacent property shall be considered the hotel premises for purposes of the issuance of a retailer's license by the State Commission. When such person has obtained a local license and has made application to the State Commission in conformity with this Act and paid the license fee provided, it shall be the duty of the State Commission to issue a retailer's license to him; provided, however, that the State Commission may refuse the issuance or renewal of a retailer's license, upon notice and after hearing, upon the grounds authorized in Section 6-3 of this Act, and, provided further, that the issuance of such license shall not prejudice the State Commission's action in subsequently suspending or revoking such license if it is determined by the State Commission, upon notice and after hearing, that the licensee has, within the same or the preceding license period, violated any provision of this Act or any rule or regulation issued pursuant thereto and in effect for 30 days prior to such violation. The Commission may also refuse to renew a license if the licensee has failed to pay an offer in compromise, pre-disciplinary settlement, or a fine imposed by order.

Any person who violates any provision of this paragraph or any rule of the State Commission for the administration and enforcement of the provisions of this paragraph is guilty of a Class C misdemeanor. In case of a continuing violation, each day's continuance thereof shall be a separate and distinct offense.
    The State Commission shall adopt rules as soon as practicable to implement the requirements of Public Act 99-904 and shall adopt rules prohibiting any such third-party appointment of a third-party provider, except for a common carrier, that has been deemed by the State Commission to have violated the provisions of this Act with regard to any winery shipper licensee.

A licensee who is not otherwise required to register under the Retailers' Occupation Tax Act must register under the Use Tax Act to collect and remit use tax to the Department of Revenue for all gallons of wine that are sold by the licensee and shipped to persons in this State. If a licensee fails to remit the tax imposed under this Act in accordance with the provisions of Article VIII of this Act, the winery shipper's license shall be revoked in accordance with the provisions of Article VII of this Act. If a licensee fails to properly register and remit tax under the Use Tax Act or the Retailers' Occupation Tax Act for all wine that is sold by the winery shipper and shipped to persons in this State, the winery shipper's license shall be revoked in accordance with the provisions of Article VII of this Act.
    A winery shipper licensee must collect, maintain, and submit to the Commission on a semi-annual basis the total number of cases per resident of wine shipped to residents of this State. A winery shipper licensed under this subsection (r) must comply with the requirements of Section 6-29 of this Act.

    As used in this subsection, "third-party provider" means any entity that provides fulfillment house services, including warehousing, packaging, distribution, order processing, or shipment of wine, but not the sale of wine, on behalf of a licensed winery shipper.
    (s) A craft distiller tasting permit license shall allow an Illinois licensed class 1 craft distiller or class 2 craft distiller to transfer a portion of its alcoholic liquor inventory from its class 1 craft distiller or class 2 craft distiller licensed premises to the premises specified in the license hereby created and to conduct a sampling, only in the premises specified in the license hereby created, of the transferred alcoholic liquor in accordance with subsection (c) of Section 6-31 of this Act.

This Section does not apply to any person who promotes, solicits, or accepts orders for wine as specifically authorized in Section 6-29 of this Act.
    A broker's license under this subsection (l) shall not entitle the holder to buy or sell any alcoholic liquors for his own account or to take or deliver title to such alcoholic liquors.
    This subsection (l) shall not apply to distributors, employees of distributors, or employees of a manufacturer who has registered the trademark, brand or name of the alcoholic liquor pursuant to Section 6-9 of this Act, and who regularly sells such alcoholic liquor in the State of Illinois only to its registrants thereunder.
    Any agent, representative, or person subject to registration pursuant to subsection (a-1) of this Section shall not be eligible to receive a broker's license.
    (m) A non-resident dealer's license shall permit such licensee to ship into and warehouse alcoholic liquor into this State from any point outside of this State, and to sell such alcoholic liquor to Illinois licensed foreign importers and importing distributors and to no one else in this State; provided that (i) said non-resident dealer shall register with the Illinois Liquor Control Commission each and every brand of alcoholic liquor which it proposes to sell to Illinois licensees during the license period, (ii) it shall comply with all of the provisions of Section 6-9 hereof with respect to registration of such Illinois licensees as may be granted the right to sell such brands at wholesale by duly filing such registration statement, thereby authorizing the non-resident dealer to proceed to sell such brands at wholesale, and (iii) the non-resident dealer shall comply with the provisions of Sections 6-5 and 6-6 of this Act to the same extent that these provisions apply to manufacturers. No person licensed as a non-resident dealer shall be granted a distributor's or importing distributor's license.
    (n) A brew pub license shall allow the licensee to only (i) manufacture up to 155,000 gallons of beer per year only on the premises specified in the license, (ii) make sales of the beer manufactured on the premises or, with the approval of the Commission, beer manufactured on another brew pub licensed premises that is wholly owned and operated by the same licensee to importing distributors, distributors, and to non-licensees for use and consumption, (iii) store the beer upon the premises, (iv) sell and offer for sale at retail from the licensed premises for off-premises consumption no more than 155,000 gallons per year so long as such sales are only made in-person, (v) sell and offer for sale at retail for use and consumption on the premises specified in the license any form of alcoholic liquor purchased from a licensed distributor or importing distributor, (vi) with the prior approval of the Commission, annually transfer no more than 155,000 gallons of beer manufactured on the premises to a licensed brew pub wholly owned and operated by the same licensee, and (vii) notwithstanding item (i) of this subsection, brew pubs wholly owned and operated by the same licensee may combine each location's production limit of 155,000 gallons of beer per year and allocate the aggregate total between the wholly owned, operated, and licensed locations.
    A brew pub licensee shall not under any circumstance sell or offer for sale beer manufactured by the brew pub licensee to retail licensees.
    A person who holds a class 2 brewer license may simultaneously hold a brew pub license if the class 2 brewer (i) does not, under any circumstance, sell or offer for sale beer manufactured by the class 2 brewer to retail licensees; (ii) does not hold more than 3 brew pub licenses in this State; (iii) does not manufacture more than a combined 3,720,000 gallons of beer per year, including the beer manufactured at the brew pub; and (iv) is not a member of or affiliated with, directly or indirectly, a manufacturer that produces more than 3,720,000 gallons of beer per year or any other alcoholic liquor.
    Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, a licensed brewer, class 2 brewer, or non-resident dealer who before July 1, 2015 manufactured less than 3,720,000 gallons of beer per year and held a brew pub license on or before July 1, 2015 may (i) continue to qualify for and hold that brew pub license for the licensed premises and (ii) manufacture more than 3,720,000 gallons of beer per year and continue to qualify for and hold that brew pub license if that brewer, class 2 brewer, or non-resident dealer does not simultaneously hold a class 1 brewer license and is not a member of or affiliated with, directly or indirectly, a manufacturer that produces more than 3,720,000 gallons of beer per year or that produces any other alcoholic liquor.
    (o) A caterer retailer license shall allow the holder to serve alcoholic liquors as an incidental part of a food service that serves prepared meals which excludes the serving of snacks as the primary meal, either on or off-site whether licensed or unlicensed. A caterer retailer license shall allow the holder, a distributor, or an importing distributor to transfer any inventory to and from the holder's retail premises and shall allow the holder to purchase alcoholic liquor from a distributor or importing distributor to be delivered directly to an off-site event.
    Nothing in this Act prohibits a distributor or importing distributor from offering credit or a refund for unused, salable beer to a holder of a caterer retailer license or a caterer retailer licensee from accepting a credit or refund for unused, salable beer, in the event an act of God is the sole reason an off-site event is cancelled and if: (i) the holder of a caterer retailer license has not transferred alcoholic liquor from its caterer retailer premises to an off-site location; (ii) the distributor or importing distributor offers the credit or refund for the unused, salable beer that it delivered to the off-site premises and not for any unused, salable beer that the distributor or importing distributor delivered to the caterer retailer's premises; and (iii) the unused, salable beer would likely spoil if transferred to the caterer retailer's premises. A caterer retailer license shall allow the holder to transfer any inventory from any off-site location to its caterer retailer premises at the conclusion of an off-site event or engage a distributor or importing distributor to transfer any inventory from any off-site location to its caterer retailer premises at the conclusion of an off-site event, provided that the distributor or importing distributor issues bona fide charges to the caterer retailer licensee for fuel, labor, and delivery and the distributor or importing distributor collects payment from the caterer retailer licensee prior to the distributor or importing distributor transferring inventory to the caterer retailer premises.
    For purposes of this subsection (o), an "act of God" means an unforeseeable event, such as a rain or snow storm, hail, a flood, or a similar event, that is the sole cause of the cancellation of an off-site, outdoor event.
    (p) An auction liquor license shall allow the licensee to sell and offer for sale at auction wine and spirits for use or consumption, or for resale by an Illinois liquor licensee in accordance with provisions of this Act. An auction liquor license will be issued to a person and it will permit the auction liquor licensee to hold the auction anywhere in the State. An auction liquor license must be obtained for each auction at least 14 days in advance of the auction date.
    (q) A special use permit license shall allow an Illinois licensed retailer to transfer a portion of its alcoholic liquor inventory from its retail licensed premises to the premises specified in the license hereby created; to purchase alcoholic liquor from a distributor or importing distributor to be delivered directly to the location specified in the license hereby created; and to sell or offer for sale at retail, only in the premises specified in the license hereby created, the transferred or delivered alcoholic liquor for use or consumption, but not for resale in any form. A special use permit license may be granted for the following time periods: one day or less; 2 or more days to a maximum of 15 days per location in any 12-month period. An applicant for the special use permit license must also submit with the application proof satisfactory to the State Commission that the applicant will provide dram shop liability insurance to the maximum limits and have local authority approval.
    A special use permit license shall allow the holder to transfer any inventory from the holder's special use premises to its retail premises at the conclusion of the special use event or engage a distributor or importing distributor to transfer any inventory from the holder's special use premises to its retail premises at the conclusion of an off-site event, provided that the distributor or importing distributor issues bona fide charges to the special use permit licensee for fuel, labor, and delivery and the distributor or importing distributor collects payment from the retail licensee prior to the distributor or importing distributor transferring inventory to the retail premises.
    Nothing in this Act prohibits a distributor or importing distributor from offering credit or a refund for unused, salable beer to a special use permit licensee or a special use permit licensee from accepting a credit or refund for unused, salable beer at the conclusion of the event specified in the license if: (i) the holder of the special use permit license has not transferred alcoholic liquor from its retail licensed premises to the premises specified in the special use permit license; (ii) the distributor or importing distributor offers the credit or refund for the unused, salable beer that it delivered to the premises specified in the special use permit license and not for any unused, salable beer that the distributor or importing distributor delivered to the retailer's premises; and (iii) the unused, salable beer would likely spoil if transferred to the retailer premises.
    (r) A winery shipper's license shall allow a person with a first-class or second-class wine manufacturer's license, a first-class or second-class wine-maker's license, or a limited wine manufacturer's license or who is licensed to make wine under the laws of another state to ship wine made by that licensee directly to a resident of this State who is 21 years of age or older for that resident's personal use and not for resale. Prior to receiving a winery shipper's license, an applicant for the license must provide the Commission with a true copy of its current license in any state in which it is licensed as a manufacturer of wine. An applicant for a winery shipper's license must also complete an application form that provides any other information the Commission deems necessary. The application form shall include all addresses from which the applicant for a winery shipper's license intends to ship wine, including the name and address of any third party, except for a common carrier, authorized to ship wine on behalf of the manufacturer. The application form shall include an acknowledgement consenting to the jurisdiction of the Commission, the Illinois Department of Revenue, and the courts of this State concerning the enforcement of this Act and any related laws, rules, and regulations, including authorizing the Department of Revenue and the Commission to conduct audits for the purpose of ensuring compliance with Public Act 95-634, and an acknowledgement that the wine manufacturer is in compliance with Section 6-2 of this Act. Any third party, except for a common carrier, authorized to ship wine on behalf of a first-class or second-class wine manufacturer's licensee, a first-class or second-class wine-maker's licensee, a limited wine manufacturer's licensee, or a person who is licensed to make wine under the laws of another state shall also be disclosed by the winery shipper's licensee, and a copy of the written appointment of the third-party wine provider, except for a common carrier, to the wine manufacturer shall be filed with the State Commission as a supplement to the winery shipper's license application or any renewal thereof. The winery shipper's license holder shall affirm under penalty of perjury, as part of the winery shipper's license application or renewal, that he or she only ships wine, either directly or indirectly through a third-party provider, from the licensee's own production.
    Except for a common carrier, a third-party provider shipping wine on behalf of a winery shipper's license holder is the agent of the winery shipper's license holder and, as such, a winery shipper's license holder is responsible for the acts and omissions of the third-party provider acting on behalf of the license holder. A third-party provider, except for a common carrier, that engages in shipping wine into Illinois on behalf of a winery shipper's license holder shall consent to the jurisdiction of the State Commission and the State. Any third-party, except for a common carrier, holding such an appointment shall, by February 1 of each calendar year and upon request by the State Commission or the Department of Revenue, file with the State Commission a statement detailing each shipment made to an Illinois resident. The statement shall include the name and address of the third-party provider filing the statement, the time period covered by the statement, and the following information:
        (1) the name, address, and license number of the
    	
winery shipper on whose behalf the shipment was made;
        (2) the quantity of the products delivered; and
        (3) the date and address of the shipment.
If the Department of Revenue or the State Commission requests a statement under this paragraph, the third-party provider must provide that statement no later than 30 days after the request is made. Any books, records, supporting papers, and documents containing information and data relating to a statement under this paragraph shall be kept and preserved for a period of 3 years, unless their destruction sooner is authorized, in writing, by the Director of Revenue, and shall be open and available to inspection by the Director of Revenue or the State Commission or any duly authorized officer, agent, or employee of the State Commission or the Department of Revenue, at all times during business hours of the day. Any person who violates any provision of this paragraph or any rule of the State Commission for the administration and enforcement of the provisions of this paragraph is guilty of a Class C misdemeanor. In case of a continuing violation, each day's continuance thereof shall be a separate and distinct offense.
    The State Commission shall adopt rules as soon as practicable to implement the requirements of Public Act 99-904 and shall adopt rules prohibiting any such third-party appointment of a third-party provider, except for a common carrier, that has been deemed by the State Commission to have violated the provisions of this Act with regard to any winery shipper licensee.
    A winery shipper licensee must pay to the Department of Revenue the State liquor gallonage tax under Section 8-1 for all wine that is sold by the licensee and shipped to a person in this State. For the purposes of Section 8-1, a winery shipper licensee shall be taxed in the same manner as a manufacturer of wine. A licensee who is not otherwise required to register under the Retailers' Occupation Tax Act must register under the Use Tax Act to collect and remit use tax to the Department of Revenue for all gallons of wine that are sold by the licensee and shipped to persons in this State. If a licensee fails to remit the tax imposed under this Act in accordance with the provisions of Article VIII of this Act, the winery shipper's license shall be revoked in accordance with the provisions of Article VII of this Act. If a licensee fails to properly register and remit tax under the Use Tax Act or the Retailers' Occupation Tax Act for all wine that is sold by the winery shipper and shipped to persons in this State, the winery shipper's license shall be revoked in accordance with the provisions of Article VII of this Act.
    A winery shipper licensee must collect, maintain, and submit to the Commission on a semi-annual basis the total number of cases per resident of wine shipped to residents of this State. A winery shipper licensed under this subsection (r) must comply with the requirements of Section 6-29 of this Act.
    Pursuant to paragraph (5.1) or (5.3) of subsection (a) of Section 3-12, the State Commission may receive, respond to, and investigate any complaint and impose any of the remedies specified in paragraph (1) of subsection (a) of Section 3-12.
    As used in this subsection, "third-party provider" means any entity that provides fulfillment house services, including warehousing, packaging, distribution, order processing, or shipment of wine, but not the sale of wine, on behalf of a licensed winery shipper.
    (s) A craft distiller tasting permit license shall allow an Illinois licensed class 1 craft distiller or class 2 craft distiller to transfer a portion of its alcoholic liquor inventory from its class 1 craft distiller or class 2 craft distiller licensed premises to the premises specified in the license hereby created and to conduct a sampling, only in the premises specified in the license hereby created, of the transferred alcoholic liquor in accordance with subsection (c) of Section 6-31 of this Act. The transferred alcoholic liquor may not be sold or resold in any form. An applicant for the craft distiller tasting permit license must also submit with the application proof satisfactory to the State Commission that the applicant will provide dram shop liability insurance to the maximum limits and have local authority approval.
    (t) A brewer warehouse permit may be issued to the holder of a class 1 brewer license or a class 2 brewer license. If the holder of the permit is a class 1 brewer licensee, the brewer warehouse permit shall allow the holder to store or warehouse up to 930,000 gallons of tax-determined beer manufactured by the holder of the permit at the premises specified on the permit. If the holder of the permit is a class 2 brewer licensee, the brewer warehouse permit shall allow the holder to store or warehouse up to 3,720,000 gallons of tax-determined beer manufactured by the holder of the permit at the premises specified on the permit. Sales to non-licensees are prohibited at the premises specified in the brewer warehouse permit.
    (u) A distilling pub license shall allow the licensee to only (i) manufacture up to 5,000 gallons of spirits per year only on the premises specified in the license, (ii) make sales of the spirits manufactured on the premises or, with the approval of the State Commission, spirits manufactured on another distilling pub licensed premises that is wholly owned and operated by the same licensee to importing distributors and distributors and to non-licensees for use and consumption, (iii) store the spirits upon the premises, (iv) sell and offer for sale at retail from the licensed premises for off-premises consumption no more than 5,000 gallons per year so long as such sales are only made in-person, (v) sell and offer for sale at retail for use and consumption on the premises specified in the license any form of alcoholic liquor purchased from a licensed distributor or importing distributor, and (vi) with the prior approval of the State Commission, annually transfer no more than 5,000 gallons of spirits manufactured on the premises to a licensed distilling pub wholly owned and operated by the same licensee.
    A distilling pub licensee shall not under any circumstance sell or offer for sale spirits manufactured by the distilling pub licensee to retail licensees.
    A person who holds a class 2 craft distiller license may simultaneously hold a distilling pub license if the class 2 craft distiller (i) does not, under any circumstance, sell or offer for sale spirits manufactured by the class 2 craft distiller to retail licensees; (ii) does not hold more than 3 distilling pub licenses in this State; (iii) does not manufacture more than a combined 100,000 gallons of spirits per year, including the spirits manufactured at the distilling pub; and (iv) is not a member of or affiliated with, directly or indirectly, a manufacturer that produces more than 100,000 gallons of spirits per year or any other alcoholic liquor.

ARTICLE VI. GENERAL PROVISIONS

    (235 ILCS 5/6-1) (from Ch. 43, par. 119)
    Sec. 6-1. Privilege granted by license; nature as to property; transferability; tax delinquencies. A license shall be purely a personal privilege, good for not to exceed one year after issuance, except a non-beverage user's license, unless sooner revoked as in this Act provided, and shall not constitute property, nor shall it be subject to attachment, garnishment or execution, nor shall it be alienable or transferable, voluntarily or involuntarily, or subject to being encumbered or hypothecated. Such license shall not descend by the laws of testate or intestate devolution, but it shall cease upon the death of the licensee, provided that executors or administrators of the estate of any deceased licensee, and the trustee of any insolvent or bankrupt licensee, when such estate consists in part of alcoholic liquor, may continue the business of the sale or manufacture of alcoholic liquor under order of the appropriate court, and may exercise the privileges of the deceased or insolvent or bankrupt licensee after the death of such decedent, or such insolvency or bankruptcy until the expiration of such license but not longer than six months after the death, bankruptcy or insolvency of such licensee. Except in the case of a non-beverage user's license, a refund shall be made of that portion of the license fees paid for any period in which the licensee shall be prevented from operating under such license in accordance with the provisions of this paragraph.
    Any licensee may renew his license at the expiration thereof, provided he is then qualified to receive a license and the premises for which such renewal license is sought are suitable for such purpose; and provided further that the renewal privilege herein provided for shall not be construed as a vested right which shall in any case prevent the city council or village president and board of trustees or county board, as the case may be, from decreasing the number of licenses to be issued within its jurisdiction. No retailer's license shall be renewed if the Department of Revenue has reported to the Illinois Liquor Control Commission that such retailer is delinquent in filing any required tax returns or paying any amounts owed to the State of Illinois until the applicant is issued a certificate by the Department of Revenue stating that all delinquent returns or amounts owed have been paid by guaranteed remittance or the payment agreement to pay all amounts owed has been accepted by the Department. No retailer's license issued by a local liquor control commissioner shall be renewed unless the applicant provides documentation that any tax owed to (i) the municipality in which the applicant is located (in the case of a license issued by the mayor or president of the board of trustees of a city, village or incorporated town acting as local liquor control commissioner) or (ii) the county in which the applicant is located (in the case of a license issued by the president or chairman of a county board acting as local liquor control commissioner) by the applicant has been satisfied by payment in the form of a cashier's check, certified check, money order, or cash.
    For a liquor license holder whose business or business operations have been suspended in any capacity due to any executive order issued on or after March 16, 2020 or any subsequent rule established by the Department of Public Health or any other agency of the State as a result of COVID-19, renewal of the license shall be automatically approved and the license shall be extended without limitation for 120 days after whichever of the following dates occurs the latest:
        (1) the day on which the region in which the liquor
    	
licensee is located enters Phase 4 of the Governor's Restore Illinois Plan as issued on May 5, 2020;
        (2) the day after the expiration of the latest
    	
executive order that limits or interrupts the business or business operations as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic; or
        (3) the day after the expiration of any rules
    	
established by the Department of Public Health or any other agency of the State that limit or interrupt the business or business operations as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.
The renewal shall be based upon the most recent liquor license application or application for renewal that was approved and received by the State Commission prior to the limitations or interruptions implemented by the Executive Order on March 16, 2020.
    A negotiable instrument received as payment for a license fee, transfer fee, late fee, offer in compromise, pre-disciplinary conference settlement, or fine imposed by order that is dishonored on presentation shall not be considered payment and shall be cause for disciplinary action.

which the applicant was previously convicted to the duties, functions, and responsibilities of the position for which a license is sought;

        (1) a statement about the decision to refuse to issue
    	
a license;

    (235 ILCS 5/6-4) (from Ch. 43, par. 121)
    Sec. 6-4. (a) No person licensed by any licensing authority as a distiller, or a wine manufacturer, or any subsidiary or affiliate thereof, or any officer, associate, member, partner, representative, employee, agent or shareholder owning more than 5% of the outstanding shares of such person shall be issued an importing distributor's or distributor's license, nor shall any person licensed by any licensing authority as an importing distributor, distributor or retailer, or any subsidiary or affiliate thereof, or any officer or associate, member, partner, representative, employee, agent or shareholder owning more than 5% of the outstanding shares of such person be issued a distiller's license, a craft distiller's license, or a wine manufacturer's license; and no person or persons licensed as a distiller, craft distiller, class 1 craft distiller, or class 2 craft distiller by any licensing authority shall have any interest, directly or indirectly, with such distributor or importing distributor.
    However, an importing distributor or distributor, which on January 1, 1985 is owned by a brewer, or any subsidiary or affiliate thereof or any officer, associate, member, partner, representative, employee, agent or shareholder owning more than 5% of the outstanding shares of the importing distributor or distributor referred to in this paragraph, may own or acquire an ownership interest of more than 5% of the outstanding shares of a wine manufacturer and be issued a wine manufacturer's license by any licensing authority.
    (b) The foregoing provisions shall not apply to any person licensed by any licensing authority as a distiller or wine manufacturer, or to any subsidiary or affiliate of any distiller or wine manufacturer who shall have been heretofore licensed by the State Commission as either an importing distributor or distributor during the annual licensing period expiring June 30, 1947, and shall actually have made sales regularly to retailers.
    (c) Provided, however, that in such instances where a distributor's or importing distributor's license has been issued to any distiller or wine manufacturer or to any subsidiary or affiliate of any distiller or wine manufacturer who has, during the licensing period ending June 30, 1947, sold or distributed as such licensed distributor or importing distributor alcoholic liquors and wines to retailers, such distiller or wine manufacturer or any subsidiary or affiliate of any distiller or wine manufacturer holding such distributor's or importing distributor's license may continue to sell or distribute to retailers such alcoholic liquors and wines which are manufactured, distilled, processed or marketed by distillers and wine manufacturers whose products it sold or distributed to retailers during the whole or any part of its licensing periods; and such additional brands and additional products may be added to the line of such distributor or importing distributor, provided, that such brands and such products were not sold or distributed by any distributor or importing distributor licensed by the State Commission during the licensing period ending June 30, 1947, but can not sell or distribute to retailers any other alcoholic liquors or wines.
    (d) It shall be unlawful for any distiller licensed anywhere to have any stock ownership or interest in any distributor's or importing distributor's license wherein any other person has an interest therein who is not a distiller and does not own more than 5% of any stock in any distillery. Nothing herein contained shall apply to such distillers or their subsidiaries or affiliates, who had a distributor's or importing distributor's license during the licensing period ending June 30, 1947, which license was owned in whole by such distiller, or subsidiaries or affiliates of such distiller.
    (e) Any person licensed as a brewer, class 1 brewer, or class 2 brewer shall be permitted to sell on the licensed premises to non-licensees for on or off-premises consumption for the premises in which he or she actually conducts such business: (i) beer manufactured by the brewer, class 1 brewer, or class 2 brewer; (ii) beer manufactured by any other brewer, class 1 brewer, or class 2 brewer; and (iii) cider. Such sales shall be limited to on-premises, in-person sales only, for lawful consumption on or off premises. Such authorization shall be considered a privilege granted by the brewer license and, other than a manufacturer of beer as stated above, no manufacturer or distributor or importing distributor, excluding airplane licensees exercising powers provided in paragraph (i) of Section 5-1 of this Act, or any subsidiary or affiliate thereof, or any officer, associate, member, partner, representative, employee or agent, or shareholder shall be issued a retailer's license, nor shall any person having a retailer's license, excluding airplane licensees exercising powers provided in paragraph (i) of Section 5-1 of this Act, or any subsidiary or affiliate thereof, or any officer, associate, member, partner, representative or agent, or shareholder be issued a manufacturer's license or importing distributor's license.
    A manufacturer of beer that imports or transfers beer into this State must comply with Sections 6-8 and 8-1 of this Act.
    A person who holds a class 1 or class 2 brewer license and is authorized by this Section to sell beer to non-licensees shall not sell beer to non-licensees from more than 3 total brewer or commonly owned brew pub licensed locations in this State. The class 1 or class 2 brewer shall designate to the State Commission the brewer or brew pub locations from which it will sell beer to non-licensees.
    A person licensed as a class 1 craft distiller or a class 2 craft distiller, including a person who holds more than one class 1 craft distiller or class 2 craft distiller license, not affiliated with any other person manufacturing spirits may be authorized by the State Commission to sell (1) up to 5,000 gallons of spirits produced by the person to non-licensees for on or off-premises consumption for the premises in which he or she actually conducts business permitting only the retail sale of spirits manufactured at such premises and (2) vermouth purchased through a licensed distributor for on-premises consumption. Such sales shall be limited to on-premises, in-person sales only, for lawful consumption on or off premises, and such authorization shall be considered a privilege granted by the class 1 craft distiller or class 2 craft distiller license. A class 1 craft distiller or class 2 craft distiller licensed for retail sale shall secure liquor liability insurance coverage in an amount at least equal to the maximum liability amounts set forth in subsection (a) of Section 6-21 of this Act.
    A class 1 craft distiller or class 2 craft distiller license holder shall not deliver any alcoholic liquor to any non-licensee off the licensed premises. A class 1 craft distiller or class 2 craft distiller shall affirm in its annual license application that it does not produce more than 50,000 or 100,000 gallons of distilled spirits annually, whichever is applicable, and that the craft distiller does not sell more than 5,000 gallons of spirits to non-licensees for on or off-premises consumption. In the application, which shall be sworn under penalty of perjury, the class 1 craft distiller or class 2 craft distiller shall state the volume of production and sales for each year since the class 1 craft distiller's or class 2 craft distiller's establishment.
    A person who holds a class 1 craft distiller or class 2 craft distiller license and is authorized by this Section to sell spirits to non-licensees shall not sell spirits to non-licensees from more than 3 total distillery or commonly owned distilling pub licensed locations in this State. The class 1 craft distiller or class 2 craft distiller shall designate to the State Commission the distillery or distilling pub locations from which it will sell spirits to non-licensees.
    (f) (Blank).
    (g) Notwithstanding any of the foregoing prohibitions, a limited wine manufacturer may sell at retail at its manufacturing site for on or off premises consumption and may sell to distributors. A limited wine manufacturer licensee shall secure liquor liability insurance coverage in an amount at least equal to the maximum liability amounts set forth in subsection (a) of Section 6-21 of this Act.
    (h) The changes made to this Section by Public Act 99-47 shall not diminish or impair the rights of any person, whether a distiller, wine manufacturer, agent, or affiliate thereof, who requested in writing and submitted documentation to the State Commission on or before February 18, 2015 to be approved for a retail license pursuant to what has heretofore been subsection (f); provided that, on or before that date, the State Commission considered the intent of that person to apply for the retail license under that subsection and, by recorded vote, the State Commission approved a resolution indicating that such a license application could be lawfully approved upon that person duly filing a formal application for a retail license and if that person, within 90 days of the State Commission appearance and recorded vote, first filed an application with the appropriate local commission, which application was subsequently approved by the appropriate local commission prior to consideration by the State Commission of that person's application for a retail license. It is further provided that the State Commission may approve the person's application for a retail license or renewals of such license if such person continues to diligently adhere to all representations made in writing to the State Commission on or before February 18, 2015, or thereafter, or in the affidavit filed by that person with the State Commission to support the issuance of a retail license and to abide by all applicable laws and duly adopted rules.

    (235 ILCS 5/6-4.5)
    Sec. 6-4.5. Prohibited ownership interests in a distributor, importing distributor, manufacturer of beer, or non-resident dealer.
    (a) The General Assembly finds, consistent with Section 6-1.5, that the 3-tier regulatory system is designed to prevent a manufacturer of beer as described in paragraph (19) of subsection (a) of Section 6-2 from exercising vertical integration between a manufacturer of beer and a distributor or importing distributor through any ownership interest, or through control of the distributor or importing distributor. The General Assembly further finds, consistent with Section 6-1.5, that the 3-tier regulatory system is designed to prevent a distributor or importing distributor as described in paragraph (20) of subsection (a) of Section 6-2 from having any ownership interest in a manufacturer of beer as described in paragraph (20) of subsection (a) of Section 6-2 except for the ownership of no more than 5% of the outstanding shares of a manufacturer of beer whose shares are publicly traded on an exchange within the meaning of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The General Assembly further finds that it is necessary to have the State Commission undertake an expedited investigation, in accordance with procedural due process, to determine whether any existing manufacturer of beer described in paragraph (19) of subsection (a) of Section 6-2 or any existing distributor or importing distributor described in paragraph (20) of subsection (a) of Section 6-2 owns a prohibited ownership interest, and an orderly process by which an existing manufacturer of beer, distributor, or importing distributor may divest itself of or sever the prohibited ownership interest by no later than January 1, 2015.
    (b) Notwithstanding any provision of this Act to the contrary, no person licensed as a manufacturer of beer as described in paragraph (19) of subsection (a) of Section 6-2 shall have any prohibited ownership interest, directly or indirectly, in a person licensed as a distributor or importing distributor. Any person who holds a prohibited ownership interest in a person licensed as a distributor or importing distributor prior to this amendatory Act of the 98th General Assembly shall, in accordance with paragraph (19) of subsection (a) of Section 6-2, be ineligible to receive or hold any license issued by the State Commission, unless that person complies with the provisions of this Section.
    (c) Notwithstanding any provision of this Act to the contrary, no person licensed in this State as a distributor or importing distributor as described in paragraph (20) of subsection (a) of Section 6-2 shall have any prohibited ownership interest, directly or indirectly, in a person licensed as a manufacturer of beer as described in paragraph (20) of subsection (a) of Section 6-2. Any person who holds an interest in a person licensed as a distributor or importing distributor in this State prior to this amendatory Act of the 98th General Assembly shall, in accordance with paragraph (20) of subsection (a) of Section 6-2, be ineligible to receive or hold a license by the State Commission, unless the person complies with the provisions of this Section. This subsection (c) shall not apply to a person who owns, on or after the effective date of this amendatory Act of the 98th General Assembly, no more than 5% of the outstanding shares of a manufacturer of beer whose shares are publicly traded on an exchange within the meaning of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
    (d) Within 30 days after the effective date of this amendatory Act of the 98th General Assembly, the State Commission shall notify in writing all persons licensed by the State Commission as a manufacturer of beer, as described in paragraph (19) of subsection (a) of Section 6-2 of the prohibited ownership interest provision set forth in subsection (b) of this Section and paragraph (19) of subsection (a) of Section 6-2. Also within 30 days after the effective date of this amendatory Act of the 98th General Assembly, the State Commission shall notify in writing all persons licensed by the State Commission as a distributor or importing distributor of the prohibited ownership interest provision set forth in subsection (c) of this Section and paragraph (20) of subsection (a) of Section 6-2. The notice provided by the State Commission shall also state for a manufacturer of beer, as described in paragraph (19) of subsection (a) of Section 6-2, that it is required to disclose in writing any ownership interest it directly or indirectly possesses in a distributor or importing distributor, as described in paragraph (20) of subsection (a) of Section 6-2, the type and amount of ownership interest possessed by it, the length of time the manufacturer of beer has held the ownership interest in the distributor or importing distributor, and any other information specified by the State Commission in its written notice. The notice provided by the State Commission shall also state for a distributor or importing distributor, as described in paragraph (20) of subsection (a) of Section 6-2, that it is required to disclose in writing any ownership interest it directly or indirectly possesses in a manufacturer of beer, as described in paragraph (19) of subsection (a) of Section 6-2, the type and amount of ownership interest possessed by it, the length of time the manufacturer of beer has held the ownership interest in the distributor or importing distributor, and any other information specified by the State Commission in its written notice.
    (e) Within 60 days after the effective date of this amendatory Act of the 98th General Assembly, each manufacturer of beer, distributor, or importing distributor subject to notification under subsection (d) of this Section shall disclose in writing and under oath the relevant ownership interest and other required information specified in the notification provided by the State Commission pursuant to that subsection. The written disclosure shall, as a mandatory obligation, be tendered to the State Commission by either personal service or via certified or registered mail at the State Commission's Springfield or Chicago office on or before the 60th day during regular business hours. Failure to tender the required written disclosure shall result in the immediate entry of an order by the State Commission suspending the licensee's license within 5 days after the 60th day, and the initiation of proceedings by the State Commission to enter an order to permanently revoke the licensee's license no later than 45 days after providing the licensee with notice and an opportunity for a hearing. Whenever the State Commission has reason to believe that a person has failed to comply with the Commission notice under this Section, it shall notify the Department of Revenue and the Attorney General, and shall file a complaint with the State's Attorney of the county where the alcoholic liquor was delivered or with appropriate law enforcement officials. Failure to make the written disclosure required under this subsection shall constitute a business offense for which the person shall be fined not more than $5,000 for a first offense, not more than $10,000 for a second offense, and not more than $15,000 for a third or subsequent offense.
    (f) Within 180 days after the effective date of this amendatory Act of the 98th General Assembly, the State Commission shall review each of the disclosures tendered to the State Commission by licensees pursuant to subsection (e) and enter an order determining whether or not each licensee is in compliance with subsection (b) or (c) of this Section, whichever is applicable, after providing each licensee with notice and an opportunity for a hearing. As part of making its determination, the State Commission shall also consider any information otherwise admissible under Section 10-40 of the Illinois Administrative Procedure Act.
    (g) If the State Commission determines, based on a preponderance of record evidence, that a manufacturer of beer, distributor, or importing distributor has no prohibited ownership interest in a licensee in violation of subsection (b) or (c) of this Section, then the State Commission shall enter an order finding that the manufacturer of beer, distributor, or importing distributor is in compliance with this Section, record the matter as closed, and serve a copy of the order of compliance on the licensee and each person with an ownership interest in the licensee.
    If the State Commission determines, based on a preponderance of record evidence, that a manufacturer of beer, as described in paragraph (19) of subsection (a) of Section 6-2, has a prohibited ownership interest as set forth in subsection (b) of this Section, then the State Commission shall enter an order finding that the manufacturer of beer is not in compliance with this Section and that the manufacturer of beer shall divest itself of that interest on or before January 1, 2015, subject to the State Commission's approval of the successive owner pursuant to the State Commission's authority provided in this Act. In addition, the State Commission shall find that the relevant distributor or importing distributor is not in compliance with this Section and that the distributor or importing distributor is required to sever the prohibited ownership interest possessed by the relevant manufacturer of beer on or before January 1, 2015, subject to the State Commission's approval of the successive owner pursuant to the State Commission's authority provided in this Act.
    If the State Commission determines, based on a preponderance of record evidence, that a distributor or importing distributor, as described in paragraph (20) of subsection (a) of Section 6-2, has a prohibited ownership interest as set forth in subsection (c) of this Section, then the State Commission shall enter an order finding that the relevant distributor or importing distributor is not in compliance with this Section and that the relevant distributor or importing distributor shall divest itself of that interest on or before January 1, 2015, subject to the State Commission's approval of the successive owner pursuant to the State Commission's authority provided in this Act. In addition, the State Commission shall find that the manufacturer of beer is not in compliance with this Section and that the manufacturer of beer shall sever the prohibited ownership interest possessed by the distributor or importing distributor on or before January 1, 2015, subject to the State Commission's approval of the successive owner pursuant to the State Commission's authority provided in this Act.
    The State Commission's order shall further find that the continued ownership of the prohibited ownership interest beyond January 1, 2015 by the manufacturer of beer, distributor, or importing distributor is against the public interest and a violation of this Section and Section 6-1.5 of the Act.
    The State Commission's order shall further find for a manufacturer of beer, as described in paragraph (19) of subsection (a) of Section 6-2, found in non-compliance with subsection (b) of this Section that its license is revoked on January 16, 2015 as to the transport, transfer, or sale of any alcoholic liquor to the relevant distributor or importing distributor that the manufacturer of beer has a prohibited ownership interest in if that interest is not properly divested on January 1, 2015, subject to the State Commission's approval of the successive owner pursuant to the State Commission's authority provided in this Act. In addition, the State Commission shall find that the license of a distributor or importing distributor that is subject to the prohibited ownership interest of the manufacturer of beer is revoked on January 16, 2015 as to the transport, transfer, or sale of alcoholic liquor from the relevant manufacturer of beer to any retailer if that ownership interest is not properly severed on January 1, 2015, subject to the State Commission's approval of the successive owner pursuant to the State Commission's authority provided in this Act.
    The State Commission's order shall further find for a distributor or importing distributor, as described in paragraph (20) of subsection (a) of Section 6-2, found in non-compliance with subsection (c) of this Section, that its license is revoked on January 16, 2015 as to the transport, transfer, or sale of any alcoholic liquor from the relevant manufacturer of beer to any retailer if that prohibited ownership interest in the manufacturer of beer is not properly divested on January 1, 2015, subject to the State Commission's approval of the successive owner pursuant to the State Commission's authority provided in this Act. In addition, the State Commission shall find that the license of the manufacturer of beer that is subject to the prohibited ownership interest of a distributor or importing distributor is revoked on January 16, 2015 as to the transport, transfer, or sale of alcoholic liquor to the distributor or importing distributor if that ownership interest is not properly severed on January 1, 2015, subject to the State Commission's approval of the successive owner pursuant to the State Commission's authority provided in this Act.
    The State Commission shall serve a copy of the order of non-compliance on the licensee and each person with an ownership interest in the licensee.
    (h) If a person with a prohibited ownership interest in a licensee under subsection (b) or (c) of this Section succeeds in divesting itself of or severing that interest and obtains the State Commission's approval of the successive owner pursuant to its authority provided in this Act on or before January 1, 2015, then the State Commission shall enter an order finding that the licensee is in compliance, record the matter as closed, and serve a copy of the order of compliance on the licensee and each person with an ownership interest in the licensee.
    If a person with a prohibited ownership interest in violation of subsection (b) or (c) of this Section fails to divest itself of or sever that interest and obtain the State Commission's approval of the successive owner pursuant to the State Commission's authority provided in this Act on or before January 1, 2015, then the State Commission shall, after notice and an opportunity for a hearing, revoke each licensee's license as specified in subsection (g) of this Section on January 16, 2015. The State Commission, when entering the order, shall give notice to the person by certified mail to cease and desist all shipments of alcoholic liquor into or within this State and to withdraw from this State within 5 working days after receipt of the notice all shipments of alcoholic liquor in transit. Whenever the State Commission has reason to believe that a person has failed to comply with the State Commission's notice under this Section, it shall notify the Department of Revenue and the Attorney General, and shall file a complaint with the State's Attorney of the county where the alcoholic liquor was delivered, or with appropriate law enforcement officials. Failure to comply with the notice issued by the State Commission under this Section is against the public interest and constitutes a business offense for which the person shall be fined not more than $5,000 for a first offense, not more than $10,000 for a second offense, and not more than $15,000 for a third or subsequent offense. Each shipment or transfer of alcoholic liquor in violation of the cease and desist notice shall constitute a separate offense.
    (i) The power and authority granted to the State Commission under this Section is in addition to any existing power or authority the State Commission has under this Act and its exercise shall be accorded precedence on the State Commission's meeting agenda so as to fully accommodate the schedule for any proceeding under the provisions of this Section. Nothing in this Act shall be construed as limiting or otherwise impairing the ability of the State Commission to conduct future investigations and proceedings sua sponte or pursuant to a complaint to ensure compliance with this Section or paragraph (19) or (20) of subsection (a) of Section 6-2 of this Act. Any future investigations and proceedings shall be conducted by the State Commission on an expedited basis and pursuant to an initiating order entered by the State Commission. The State Commission shall enter its initiating order within 30 days after the receipt of a complaint. The initiating order shall set forth a schedule by which the required notices, disclosures, determinations, or orders specified in subsections (d), (e), (f), (g), and (h) shall be made or entered, and the period of time by which a licensee shall divest itself of or sever a prohibited ownership interest, which shall be no later than 540 days after the entry of the initiating order.
    (j) Any association or non-profit corporation representing beer distributors in this State shall have standing to intervene and otherwise participate as a party in any proceeding undertaken by the State Commission under this Section to review and determine compliance or non-compliance with this Section.
    (k) For purposes of this Section, the term "ownership interest" means a legal, equitable, or beneficial interest recognized under Illinois law. The term "prohibited ownership interest" means an ownership interest in a distributor, importing distributor, or manufacturer of beer as specified in this Section.

    Sec. 6-5. Except as otherwise provided in this Section, it is unlawful for any person having a retailer's license or any officer, associate, member, representative or agent of such licensee to accept, receive or borrow money, or anything else of value, or accept or receive credit (other than merchandising credit in the ordinary course of business for a period not to exceed 30 days) directly or indirectly from any manufacturer, importing distributor or distributor of alcoholic liquor, or from any person connected with or in any way representing, or from any member of the family of, such manufacturer, importing distributor, distributor or wholesaler, or from any stockholders in any corporation engaged in manufacturing, distributing or wholesaling of such liquor, or from any officer, manager, agent or representative of said manufacturer. Except as provided below, it is unlawful for any manufacturer or distributor or importing distributor to give or lend money or anything of value, or otherwise loan or extend credit (except such merchandising credit) directly or indirectly to any retail licensee or to the manager, representative, agent, officer or director of such licensee. A manufacturer, distributor or importing distributor may furnish free advertising, posters, signs, brochures, hand-outs, or other promotional devices or materials to any unit of government owning or operating any auditorium, exhibition hall, recreation facility or other similar facility holding a retailer's license, provided that the primary purpose of such promotional devices or materials is to promote public events being held at such facility. A unit of government owning or operating such a facility holding a retailer's license may accept such promotional devices or materials designed primarily to promote public events held at the facility. No retail licensee delinquent beyond the 30 day period specified in this Section shall solicit, accept or receive credit, purchase or acquire alcoholic liquors, directly or indirectly from any other licensee, and no manufacturer, distributor or importing distributor shall knowingly grant or extend credit, sell, furnish or supply alcoholic liquors to any such delinquent retail licensee; provided that the purchase price of all beer sold to a retail licensee shall be paid by the retail licensee in cash on or before delivery of the beer, and unless the purchase price payable by a retail licensee for beer sold to him in returnable bottles shall expressly include a charge for the bottles and cases, the retail licensee shall, on or before delivery of such beer, pay the seller in cash a deposit in an amount not less than the deposit required to be paid by the distributor to the brewer; but where the brewer sells direct to the retailer, the deposit shall be an amount no less than that required by the brewer from his own distributors; and provided further, that in no instance shall this deposit be less than 50 cents for each case of beer in pint or smaller bottles and 60 cents for each case of beer in quart or half-gallon bottles; and provided further, that the purchase price of all beer sold to an importing distributor or distributor shall be paid by such importing distributor or distributor in cash on or before the 15th day (Sundays and holidays excepted) after delivery of such beer to such purchaser; and unless the purchase price payable by such importing distributor or distributor for beer sold in returnable bottles and cases shall expressly include a charge for the bottles and cases, such importing distributor or distributor shall, on or before the 15th day (Sundays and holidays excepted) after delivery of such beer to such purchaser, pay the seller in cash a required amount as a deposit to assure the return of such bottles and cases. Nothing herein contained shall prohibit any licensee from crediting or refunding to a purchaser the actual amount of money paid for bottles, cases, kegs or barrels returned by the purchaser to the seller or paid by the purchaser as a deposit on bottles, cases, kegs or barrels, when such containers or packages are returned to the seller. Nothing herein contained shall prohibit any manufacturer, importing distributor or distributor from extending usual and customary credit for alcoholic liquor sold to customers or purchasers who live in or maintain places of business outside of this State when such alcoholic liquor is actually transported and delivered to such points outside of this State.
    A manufacturer, distributor, or importing distributor may furnish free social media advertising to a retail licensee if the social media advertisement does not contain the retail price of any alcoholic liquor and the social media advertisement complies with any applicable rules or regulations issued by the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau of the United States Department of the Treasury. A manufacturer, distributor, or importing distributor may list the names of one or more unaffiliated retailers in the advertisement of alcoholic liquor through social media. Nothing in this Section shall prohibit a retailer from communicating with a manufacturer, distributor, or importing distributor on social media or sharing media on the social media of a manufacturer, distributor, or importing distributor. A retailer may request free social media advertising from a manufacturer, distributor, or importing distributor. Nothing in this Section shall prohibit a manufacturer, distributor, or importing distributor from sharing, reposting, or otherwise forwarding a social media post by a retail licensee, so long as the sharing, reposting, or forwarding of the social media post does not contain the retail price of any alcoholic liquor. No manufacturer, distributor, or importing distributor shall pay or reimburse a retailer, directly or indirectly, for any social media advertising services, except as specifically permitted in this Act. No retailer shall accept any payment or reimbursement, directly or indirectly, for any social media advertising services offered by a manufacturer, distributor, or importing distributor, except as specifically permitted in this Act. For the purposes of this Section, "social media" means a service, platform, or site where users communicate with one another and share media, such as pictures, videos, music, and blogs, with other users free of charge.
    No right of action shall exist for the collection of any claim based upon credit extended to a distributor, importing distributor or retail licensee contrary to the provisions of this Section.
    Every manufacturer, importing distributor and distributor shall submit or cause to be submitted, to the State Commission, in triplicate, not later than Thursday of each calendar week, a verified written list of the names and respective addresses of each retail licensee purchasing spirits or wine from such manufacturer, importing distributor or distributor who, on the first business day of that calendar week, was delinquent beyond the above mentioned permissible merchandising credit period of 30 days; or, if such is the fact, a verified written statement that no retail licensee purchasing spirits or wine was then delinquent beyond such permissible merchandising credit period of 30 days.
    Every manufacturer, importing distributor and distributor shall submit or cause to be submitted, to the State Commission, in triplicate, a verified written list of the names and respective addresses of each previously reported delinquent retail licensee who has cured such delinquency by payment, which list shall be submitted not later than the close of the second full business day following the day such delinquency was so cured.
    Such written verified reports required to be submitted by this Section shall be posted by the State Commission in each of its offices in places available for public inspection not later than the day following receipt thereof by the Commission. The reports so posted shall constitute notice to every manufacturer, importing distributor and distributor of the information contained therein. Actual notice to manufacturers, importing distributors and distributors of the information contained in any such posted reports, however received, shall also constitute notice of such information.
    The 30 day merchandising credit period allowed by this Section shall commence with the day immediately following the date of invoice and shall include all successive days including Sundays and holidays to and including the 30th successive day.
    In addition to other methods allowed by law, payment by check during the period for which merchandising credit may be extended under the provisions of this Section shall be considered payment. All checks received in payment for alcoholic liquor shall be promptly deposited for collection. A post dated check or a check dishonored on presentation for payment shall not be deemed payment.
    A retail licensee shall not be deemed to be delinquent in payment for any alleged sale to him of alcoholic liquor when there exists a bona fide dispute between such retailer and a manufacturer, importing distributor or distributor with respect to the amount of indebtedness existing because of such alleged sale. A retail licensee shall not be deemed to be delinquent under this provision and 11 Ill. Adm. Code 100.90 until 30 days after the date on which the region in which the retail licensee is located enters Phase 4 of the Governor's Restore Illinois Plan as issued on May 5, 2020.
    A delinquent retail licensee who engages in the retail liquor business at 2 or more locations shall be deemed to be delinquent with respect to each such location.
    The license of any person who violates any provision of this Section shall be subject to suspension or revocation in the manner provided by this Act.
    If any part or provision of this Article or the application thereof to any person or circumstances shall be adjudged invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, such judgment shall be confined by its operation to the controversy in which it was mentioned and shall not affect or invalidate the remainder of this Article or the application thereof to any other person or circumstance and to this and the provisions of this Article are declared severable.

    (235 ILCS 5/6-5.5)
    Sec. 6-5.5. Consignment sales prohibited; retailer returns.
    (a) In this Section, "retailer" means a retailer, special event retailer, special use permit licensee, caterer retailer, or brew pub.
    (b) It is unlawful for a manufacturer with self-distribution privileges, importing distributor, or distributor to sell, offer for sale, or contract to sell to any retailer, or for any such retailer to purchase, offer to purchase, or contract to purchase any products:
        (1) on consignment or conditional sale,
    	
pursuant to which the retailer has no obligation to pay for the product until sold;
        (2) with the privilege of return unless
    	
expressly authorized in this Act;
        (3) on any basis other than a bona fide sale;
    	
or
        (4) if any part of the sale involves, directly
    	
or indirectly, the acquisition by the retailer of other products from a manufacturer with self-distribution privileges, importing distributor, or distributor, or an agreement to acquire other products from the manufacturer with self-distribution privileges, importing distributor, or distributor.
    (c) Transactions involving the bona fide return of products for ordinary and usual commercial reasons arising after the product has been sold are not prohibited.
    (d) Unless there is a bona fide business reason for replacement of an alcoholic liquor product when delivered, the alcoholic liquor product may not be replaced free of charge to a retailer. Replacement of an alcoholic liquor product damaged while in a retailer's possession constitutes the providing of something of value and is a violation of Sections 6-4, 6-5, and 6-6 of this Act. A manufacturer with self-distribution privileges, importing distributor, or distributor is not required to accept the return of products for the reasons stated in items (1) through (7) of subsection (f).
        (1) A manufacturer with self-distribution
    	
privileges, importing distributor, or distributor may not accept the return of alcoholic liquor products as breakage if the product was damaged after delivery and while in the possession of the retailer. The manufacturer with self-distribution privileges, importing distributor, or distributor may replace damaged cartons, packaging, or carrying containers of alcoholic liquor at any time.
        (2) Alcoholic liquor products or other compensation
    	
shall not be furnished to a retailer for product breakage that occurs as a result of handling by the retailer or its agents, employees, or customers.
        (3) If an alcoholic liquor product has been
    	
damaged prior to or at the time of actual delivery, the product may only be exchanged for an equal quantity of identical product or returned for credit. If an identical product is unavailable, a similar type of product, including a similarly priced product, may be exchanged.
        (4) If an alcoholic liquor product has been
    	
damaged prior to or at the time of actual delivery, the product may be exchanged no later than 15 days after delivery under the following conditions:
            (A) If the pre-delivery damage is visible at
        	
the time of delivery, the retailer must identify the damaged product immediately.
            (B) If the damage is latent and not visible
        	
at the time of delivery, the retailer must notify the manufacturer with self-distribution privileges, importing distributor, or distributor of the pre-delivery damage within 15 days after delivery, or the date of invoice, whichever is later.
    (e) It is unlawful to sell, offer to sell, or contract to sell alcoholic liquor products with the privilege of return for any reason, other than those considered to be ordinary and usual commercial reasons, arising after the product has been sold. A manufacturer with self-distribution privileges, importing distributor, or distributor is under no obligation to accept a return or make an exchange for any product. A manufacturer with self-distribution privileges, importing distributor, or distributor that elects to make an authorized exchange of a product or return of a product for cash or credit does so at its sole discretion and must maintain proper books and records of the transaction in accordance with 11 Ill. Adm. Code 100.130.
    (f) Ordinary and usual commercial reasons for the return of alcoholic liquor products are limited to the following:
        (1) Defective products. Products that are
    	
unmarketable because of product deterioration, leaking containers, damaged labels, or missing or mutilated tamper evident closures may be exchanged for an equal quantity of identical or similar products, including similarly priced products, or credit against outstanding indebtedness.
        (2) Error in products delivered. Any
    	
discrepancy between products ordered and products delivered may be corrected, within 15 days after the date of delivery or date of invoice, whichever is later, by exchange of the products delivered for those that were ordered or by a return for credit against outstanding indebtedness.
        (3) Products that may no longer be lawfully
    	
sold. Products that may no longer be lawfully sold may be returned for credit against outstanding indebtedness. This includes situations in which, due to a change in regulation or administrative procedure over which a retailer has no control, a particular size or brand is no longer permitted to be sold.
        (4) Termination of business. Products on hand
    	
at the time a retailer terminates operations may be returned for cash or credit against outstanding indebtedness. This does not include a temporary seasonal shutdown.
        (5) Change in products. A retailer's inventory
    	
of a product that has been changed in formula, proof, label, or container may be exchanged for equal quantities of the new version of that product.
        (6) Discontinued products. If a manufacturer,
    	
non-resident dealer, foreign importer, or importing distributor discontinues the production or importation of a product, a retailer may return its inventory of that product for cash or credit against outstanding indebtedness.
        (7) Seasonal dealers. Manufacturers with
    	
self-distribution privileges, importing distributors, or distributors may accept the return of product from retailers who are only open a portion of the year if the products are likely to spoil during the off-season. These returns shall be for cash or credit against outstanding indebtedness.
    (g) Without limitation, the following are not considered ordinary and commercial reasons to justify a return of an alcoholic liquor product:
        (1) Overstocked and slow-moving alcoholic
    	
liquor products. The return or exchange of a product because it is overstocked or slow moving does not constitute a return for ordinary and usual commercial reasons.
        (2) Seasonal alcoholic liquor products. The
    	
return for cash or credit or exchange of wine or spirits for which there is only a limited or seasonal demand, such as holiday decanters and certain distinctive bottles, does not constitute a return for ordinary and usual commercial reasons. Nothing in this item (2) prohibits the exchange of seasonal beer products for similarly priced beer products.
    (h) Nothing in this Section prohibits a manufacturer with self-distribution privileges, importing distributor, or distributor from accepting the return of beer from a retailer if the beer is near or beyond its freshness date, code date, pull date, or other similar date marking the deterioration or freshness of the beer if:
        (1) the brewer has policies and procedures in place
    	
that specify the date the retailer must pull the product;
        (2) the brewer's freshness return or exchange
    	
policies and procedures are readily verifiable and consistently followed by the brewer; and
        (3) the container has identifying markings that
    	
correspond with this date.
    Returns under this subsection may be accepted in return for credit against indebtedness or equal amounts of the same or similar beer, including a similarly priced product.
    For purposes of this Section, beer is near code on any date on or before the freshness or code date not to exceed 30 days prior to the freshness or code date. If near-code beer is returned, a manufacturer with self-distribution privileges, importing distributor, or distributor may sell near-code beer to another retailer who may reasonably sell the beer on or before the expiration of the freshness or code date. No beer shall be returned as near-code prior to 30 days of the freshness or code date.
    It is a violation of this Section for a retailer to hold beer for the purpose of returning beer as out of code.

    (a) Nothing in this Act shall authorize the Illinois Liquor Control Commission to regulate or exercise jurisdiction over any action, transaction, and business of manufacturers, distributors, or retailers engaged in any transaction involving the furnishing, selling, or offering for sale of non-alcoholic merchandise by manufacturers, distributors, or retailers, unless the transaction involves expressed or implied agreements or understandings prohibited by this Act.
    (b) Non-alcoholic merchandise may be sold by a manufacturer class license holder, non-resident dealer, foreign importer, importing distributor, or distributor to a retail licensee if:
        (1) the manufacturer class license holder,
    	
non-resident dealer, foreign importer, importing distributor, or distributor is also in business as a bona fide producer or vendor of other merchandise;
        (2) the merchandise is sold at its fair market value;

        (5) the individual selling prices of the
    	
non-alcoholic merchandise and alcoholic liquor sold in a single transaction can be determined from commercial documents covering the sales transaction if non-alcoholic merchandise is sold in the same transaction as alcoholic liquor; and
        (6) the price is collected by the manufacturer class
    	
license holder, non-resident dealer, foreign importer, or distributor within 30 days of the date of the sale, unless other terms are established in writing between the parties.

    (f) Notwithstanding any provision of this Act to the contrary, a manufacturer class license holder, non-resident dealer, foreign importer, importing distributor, or distributor may package and distribute alcoholic liquor in combination with other non-alcoholic merchandise products if the alcoholic liquor and non-alcoholic merchandise was originally packaged together for ultimate sale to consumers by the manufacturer or agent of the manufacturer as originally packaged by the manufacturer or agent of the manufacturer for ultimate sale to consumers.

        (3) sell dispensing equipment to a retailer, special
    	
event retailer, special use permit licensee, or caterer retailer for a price that is not less than the cost to the manufacturer, distributor, or importing distributor. For purposes of this paragraph (3), the cost of dispensing equipment is the amount that the manufacturer, distributor, or importing distributor paid for the dispensing equipment. If the manufacturer, distributor, or importing distributor did not pay for the dispensing equipment but was given the equipment, the cost of the dispensing equipment is equal to (i) the amount another manufacturer, distributor, or importing distributor paid for the dispensing equipment, (ii) the cost of manufacturing or producing the dispensing equipment, or (iii) the fair market value of the dispensing equipment.
    A manufacturer, distributor, or importing distributor may also enter into a written lease for the fair market value of the dispensing equipment to retailers, special event retailers, special use permit licensees, or caterer retailers. The manufacturer, distributor, or importing distributor shall invoice and collect the sale price or payment for the entire lease period from the retailer, special event retailer, special use permit licensee, or caterer retailer within 30 days of the date of the invoice or from the date the lease is executed. The term of any lease for dispensing equipment shall not exceed 180 days in the aggregate in one calendar year, and no lease shall be renewed automatically. There shall be a lapse of 90 consecutive days before the beginning of a new lease term.
    At the direction of the manufacturer, distributor, or importing distributor, the retailer, special event retailer, special use permit licensee, or caterer retailer shall return the equipment or the manufacturer, distributor, or importing distributor shall retrieve the dispensing equipment at the termination of the lease.
    In this Section, "dispensing equipment" means any portable or temporary unit the primary purpose of which is to pour alcoholic liquor or to maintain the alcoholic liquor in a consumable state. "Dispensing equipment" includes courtesy wagons, beer wagons, beer trailers, ice bins, draft coolers, coil boxes, portable bars, and kiosks. "Dispensing equipment" does not include permanent tap systems, permanent refrigeration systems, or any other built-in or physically attached fixture of the retailer, special event retailer, special use permit licensee, or caterer retailer.
    In this Section, "fair market value" for the purposes of leasing dispensing equipment means (i) the cost of depreciation of the dispensing equipment to the manufacturer, distributor, or importing distributor for the same period of the lease or (ii) the cost of depreciation the manufacturer, distributor, or importing distributor would have incurred based upon the market value of the dispensing equipment if the manufacturer, distributor, or importing distributor did not pay for the dispensing equipment or if the dispensing equipment is fully depreciated.

    (235 ILCS 5/6-8) (from Ch. 43, par. 125)
    Sec. 6-8. Each manufacturer or importing distributor or foreign importer shall keep an accurate record of all alcoholic liquors manufactured, distributed, sold, used, or delivered by him in this State during each month, showing therein to whom sold, and shall furnish a copy thereof or a report thereon to the State Commission, as the State Commission may, request.
    Each importing distributor or manufacturer to whom alcoholic liquors imported into this State have been consigned shall effect possession and physical control thereof by storing such alcoholic liquors in the premises wherein such importing distributor or manufacturer is licensed to engage in such business as an importing distributor or manufacturer and to make such alcoholic liquors together with accompanying invoices, bills of lading and receiving tickets available for inspection by an agent or representative of the Department of Revenue and of the State Commission.

    (235 ILCS 5/6-9) (from Ch. 43, par. 126)
    Sec. 6-9. Registration of trade marks; sale within geographical area; delivery to authorized persons. The Legislature hereby finds and declares that for purposes of ensuring the preservation and enhancement of interbrand competition in the alcoholic liquor industry within the State, ensuring that importation and distribution of alcoholic liquor in the State will be subject to thorough and inexpensive monitoring by the State, reducing the importation of illicit or untaxed alcoholic liquor into the State, excluding misbranded alcoholic liquor products from the State, providing incentives to distributors to service and sell to larger numbers of retail licensees in the geographic area where such distributors are engaged in business, and reducing the amount of spoiled and overaged alcoholic liquor products sold to consumers, it is necessary to restrict the purchase of alcoholic liquors at wholesale in the State to those persons selected by the manufacturer, distributor, importing distributor or foreign importer who owns or controls the trade mark, brand or name of the alcoholic liquor products sold to such persons, and to restrict the geographic area or areas within which such persons sell such alcoholic liquor at wholesale, as provided in this Section.
    Each manufacturer, non-resident dealer, distributor, importing distributor, or foreign importer who owns or controls the trade mark, brand or name of any alcoholic liquor shall register with the State Commission, in the Chicago office, on or before the effective date, the name of each person to whom such manufacturer, non-resident dealer, distributor, importing distributor, or foreign importer grants the right to sell at wholesale in this State any such alcoholic liquor, specifying the particular trade mark, brand or name of alcoholic liquor as to which such right is granted, the geographical area or areas for which such right is granted and the period of time for which such rights are granted to such person. Each manufacturer, non-resident dealer, distributor or importing distributor, or foreign importer who is required to register under this Section must furnish a copy of the registration statement at the time of appointment to the person who has been granted the right to sell alcoholic liquor at wholesale. However, if a person who has been appointed the right to sell alcoholic liquor at wholesale does not receive a copy of the registration statement as required under this Section, such person may file a registration statement with the State Commission, provided that the person furnishes a copy of that registration statement to the manufacturer, non-resident dealer, distributor, importing distributor, or foreign importer within 30 days of filing the registration statement. The registration statement shall state:
    (1) the name of the person appointed;
    (2) the name of the manufacturer, non-resident dealer, distributor, importing distributor, or foreign importer from whom the person received the right to sell alcoholic liquor;
    (3) the particular trade mark, brand, or name of alcoholic liquor as to which the right to sell at wholesale is granted; and
    (4) the geographical areas for which the right to sell at wholesale is granted.
    Such manufacturer, non-resident dealer, distributor, importing distributor, or foreign importer may grant the right to sell at wholesale any trade mark, brand or name of any alcoholic liquor in any geographical area to more than one person. If the registration is received after the effective date, the Commission shall treat the date the registration was received in the Chicago office as the effective date. Such registration shall be made on a form prescribed by the State Commission and the State Commission may require such registration to be on a form provided by it.
    A non-resident dealer or foreign importer who is not a manufacturer shall file the registration statement jointly with the manufacturer identifying the person authorized by the manufacturer to sign the registration statement on behalf of the manufacturer.
    No such registration shall be made in any other manner than as is provided in this Section and only those persons registered by the manufacturer, non-resident dealer, distributor, importing distributor or foreign importer, shall have the right to sell at wholesale in this State, the brand of alcoholic liquor specified on the registration form.
    However, a licensed Illinois distributor who has not been registered to sell a brand of alcoholic liquor, but for a period of 2 years prior to November 8, 1979 has been engaged in the purchase of a brand for resale from a licensed Illinois distributor who has the right to sell that brand at wholesale, may continue to purchase and resell the brand at wholesale, and may purchase from the same distributor and resell at wholesale any new brands of the same manufacturer, provided that:
        (1) Within 60 days after November 8, 1979 he
    	
identifies the brand which he so purchased to the State Commission and the Commission within 30 days thereafter verifies that the purchases have occurred;
        (2) Thereafter, he notifies the State Commission in
    	
writing of any brands of the same manufacturer which he wishes to purchase from the same distributor that were not available for distribution on or before November 8, 1979, and that the Commission within 30 days of such notification verifies that the brand is a new brand of the same manufacturer, and that the same licensed Illinois distributor has the right to sell the new brand at wholesale;
        (3) His licensed business address is within the
    	
geographical area for which the licensed Illinois distributor from whom the purchases are made has the right to sell said brand or brands of alcoholic liquor; and
        (4) His sales are made within the geographical area
    	
for which the licensed Illinois distributor from whom the purchases are made has the right to sell the brand or brands of alcoholic liquor and only to retail licensees whose licensed premises are located within the aforementioned geographical area.
    No person to whom such right is granted shall sell at wholesale in this State any alcoholic liquor bearing such trade mark, brand or name outside of the geographical area for which such person holds such selling right, as registered with the State Commission, nor shall he sell such alcoholic liquor within such geographical area to a retail licensee if the premises specified in such retailer's license are located outside such geographical area. Any licensed Illinois distributor who has not been granted the right to sell any alcoholic liquor at wholesale and is purchasing alcoholic liquor from a person who has been granted the right to sell at wholesale may sell and deliver only to retail licensees whose licensed premises are within the same geographical area as the person who has been granted the right to sell at wholesale.
    No manufacturer, importing distributor, distributor, non-resident dealer, or foreign importer shall sell or deliver any package containing alcoholic liquor manufactured or distributed by him for resale, unless the person to whom such package is sold or delivered is authorized to receive such package in accordance with the provisions of this Act.

    (b) On January 1, 2002 and every 2 years thereafter, the dollar amounts in items (i) and (ii) of subsection (a) shall be increased or decreased by a percentage equal to the percentage increase or decrease in the Consumer Price Index during the previous 2 years according to the most recent available data.

It shall be the duty of every retail licensee to make books and records available upon reasonable notice for the purpose of investigation and control by the Illinois Liquor Control Commission or any local liquor control commission having jurisdiction over the licensee. Such books and records need not be maintained on the licensed premises, but must be maintained in the State of Illinois; however, if access is available electronically, the books and records may be maintained out of state. However, all original invoices or copies thereof covering purchases of alcoholic liquor must be retained on the licensed premises for a period of 90 days after such purchase, unless the Commission has granted a waiver in response to a written request in cases where records are kept at a central business location within the State of Illinois or in cases where books and records that are available electronically are maintained out of state.

    (235 ILCS 5/6-16) (from Ch. 43, par. 131)
    Sec. 6-16. Prohibited sales and possession.
    (a) (i) No licensee nor any officer, associate, member, representative, agent, or employee of such licensee shall sell, give, or deliver alcoholic liquor to any person under the age of 21 years or to any intoxicated person, except as provided in Section 6-16.1. (ii) No express company, common carrier, or contract carrier nor any representative, agent, or employee on behalf of an express company, common carrier, or contract carrier that carries or transports alcoholic liquor for delivery within this State shall knowingly give or knowingly deliver to a residential address any shipping container clearly labeled as containing alcoholic liquor and labeled as requiring signature of an adult of at least 21 years of age to any person in this State under the age of 21 years. An express company, common carrier, or contract carrier that carries or transports such alcoholic liquor for delivery within this State shall obtain a signature at the time of delivery acknowledging receipt of the alcoholic liquor by an adult who is at least 21 years of age. At no time while delivering alcoholic beverages within this State may any representative, agent, or employee of an express company, common carrier, or contract carrier that carries or transports alcoholic liquor for delivery within this State deliver the alcoholic liquor to a residential address without the acknowledgment of the consignee and without first obtaining a signature at the time of the delivery by an adult who is at least 21 years of age. A signature of a person on file with the express company, common carrier, or contract carrier does not constitute acknowledgement of the consignee. Any express company, common carrier, or contract carrier that transports alcoholic liquor for delivery within this State that violates this item (ii) of this subsection (a) by delivering alcoholic liquor without the acknowledgement of the consignee and without first obtaining a signature at the time of the delivery by an adult who is at least 21 years of age is guilty of a business offense for which the express company, common carrier, or contract carrier that transports alcoholic liquor within this State shall be fined not more than $1,001 for a first offense, not more than $5,000 for a second offense, and not more than $10,000 for a third or subsequent offense. An express company, common carrier, or contract carrier shall be held vicariously liable for the actions of its representatives, agents, or employees. For purposes of this Act, in addition to other methods authorized by law, an express company, common carrier, or contract carrier shall be considered served with process when a representative, agent, or employee alleged to have violated this Act is personally served. Each shipment of alcoholic liquor delivered in violation of this item (ii) of this subsection (a) constitutes a separate offense. (iii) No person, after purchasing or otherwise obtaining alcoholic liquor, shall sell, give, or deliver such alcoholic liquor to another person under the age of 21 years, except in the performance of a religious ceremony or service. Except as otherwise provided in item (ii), any express company, common carrier, or contract carrier that transports alcoholic liquor within this State that violates the provisions of item (i), (ii), or (iii) of this paragraph of this subsection (a) is guilty of a Class A misdemeanor and the sentence shall include, but shall not be limited to, a fine of not less than $500. Any person who violates the provisions of item (iii) of this paragraph of this subsection (a) is guilty of a Class A misdemeanor and the sentence shall include, but shall not be limited to a fine of not less than $500 for a first offense and not less than $2,000 for a second or subsequent offense. Any person who knowingly violates the provisions of item (iii) of this paragraph of this subsection (a) is guilty of a Class 4 felony if a death occurs as the result of the violation.
    If a licensee or officer, associate, member, representative, agent, or employee of the licensee, or a representative, agent, or employee of an express company, common carrier, or contract carrier that carries or transports alcoholic liquor for delivery within this State, is prosecuted under this paragraph of this subsection (a) for selling, giving, or delivering alcoholic liquor to a person under the age of 21 years, the person under 21 years of age who attempted to buy or receive the alcoholic liquor may be prosecuted pursuant to Section 6-20 of this Act, unless the person under 21 years of age was acting under the authority of a law enforcement agency, the Illinois Liquor Control Commission, or a local liquor control commissioner pursuant to a plan or action to investigate, patrol, or conduct any similar enforcement action.
    For the purpose of preventing the violation of this Section, any licensee, or his agent or employee, or a representative, agent, or employee of an express company, common carrier, or contract carrier that carries or transports alcoholic liquor for delivery within this State, shall refuse to sell, deliver, or serve alcoholic beverages to any person who is unable to produce adequate written evidence of identity and of the fact that he or she is over the age of 21 years, if requested by the licensee, agent, employee, or representative.
    Adequate written evidence of age and identity of the person is a document issued by a federal, state, county, or municipal government, or subdivision or agency thereof, including, but not limited to, a motor vehicle operator's license, a registration certificate issued under the Federal Selective Service Act, or an identification card issued to a member of the Armed Forces. Proof that the defendant-licensee, or his employee or agent, or the representative, agent, or employee of the express company, common carrier, or contract carrier that carries or transports alcoholic liquor for delivery within this State demanded, was shown and reasonably relied upon such written evidence in any transaction forbidden by this Section is an affirmative defense in any criminal prosecution therefor or to any proceedings for the suspension or revocation of any license based thereon. It shall not, however, be an affirmative defense if the agent or employee accepted the written evidence knowing it to be false or fraudulent. If a false or fraudulent Illinois driver's license or Illinois identification card is presented by a person less than 21 years of age to a licensee or the licensee's agent or employee for the purpose of ordering, purchasing, attempting to purchase, or otherwise obtaining or attempting to obtain the serving of any alcoholic beverage, the law enforcement officer or agency investigating the incident shall, upon the conviction of the person who presented the fraudulent license or identification, make a report of the matter to the Secretary of State on a form provided by the Secretary of State.
    However, no agent or employee of the licensee or employee of an express company, common carrier, or contract carrier that carries or transports alcoholic liquor for delivery within this State shall be disciplined or discharged for selling or furnishing liquor to a person under 21 years of age if the agent or employee demanded and was shown, before furnishing liquor to a person under 21 years of age, adequate written evidence of age and identity of the person issued by a federal, state, county or municipal government, or subdivision or agency thereof, including but not limited to a motor vehicle operator's license, a registration certificate issued under the Federal Selective Service Act, or an identification card issued to a member of the Armed Forces. This paragraph, however, shall not apply if the agent or employee accepted the written evidence knowing it to be false or fraudulent.
    Any person who sells, gives, or furnishes to any person under the age of 21 years any false or fraudulent written, printed, or photostatic evidence of the age and identity of such person or who sells, gives or furnishes to any person under the age of 21 years evidence of age and identification of any other person is guilty of a Class A misdemeanor and the person's sentence shall include, but shall not be limited to, a fine of not less than $500.
    Any person under the age of 21 years who presents or offers to any licensee, his agent or employee, any written, printed or photostatic evidence of age and identity that is false, fraudulent, or not actually his or her own for the purpose of ordering, purchasing, attempting to purchase or otherwise procuring or attempting to procure, the serving of any alcoholic beverage, who falsely states in writing that he or she is at least 21 years of age when receiving alcoholic liquor from a representative, agent, or employee of an express company, common carrier, or contract carrier, or who has in his or her possession any false or fraudulent written, printed, or photostatic evidence of age and identity, is guilty of a Class A misdemeanor and the person's sentence shall include, but shall not be limited to, the following: a fine of not less than $500 and at least 25 hours of community service. If possible, any community service shall be performed for an alcohol abuse prevention program.
    Any person under the age of 21 years who has any alcoholic beverage in his or her possession on any street or highway or in any public place or in any place open to the public is guilty of a Class A misdemeanor. This Section does not apply to possession by a person under the age of 21 years making a delivery of an alcoholic beverage in pursuance of the order of his or her parent or in pursuance of his or her employment.
    (a-1) It is unlawful for any parent or guardian to knowingly permit his or her residence, any other private property under his or her control, or any vehicle, conveyance, or watercraft under his or her control to be used by an invitee of the parent's child or the guardian's ward, if the invitee is under the age of 21, in a manner that constitutes a violation of this Section. A parent or guardian is deemed to have knowingly permitted his or her residence, any other private property under his or her control, or any vehicle, conveyance, or watercraft under his or her control to be used in violation of this Section if he or she knowingly authorizes or permits consumption of alcoholic liquor by underage invitees. Any person who violates this subsection (a-1) is guilty of a Class A misdemeanor and the person's sentence shall include, but shall not be limited to, a fine of not less than $500. Where a violation of this subsection (a-1) directly or indirectly results in great bodily harm or death to any person, the person violating this subsection shall be guilty of a Class 4 felony. Nothing in this subsection (a-1) shall be construed to prohibit the giving of alcoholic liquor to a person under the age of 21 years in the performance of a religious ceremony or service in observation of a religious holiday.
    For the purposes of this subsection (a-1) where the residence or other property has an owner and a tenant or lessee, the trier of fact may infer that the residence or other property is occupied only by the tenant or lessee.
    (b) Except as otherwise provided in this Section whoever violates this Section shall, in addition to other penalties provided for in this Act, be guilty of a Class A misdemeanor.
    (c) Any person shall be guilty of a Class A misdemeanor where he or she knowingly authorizes or permits a residence which he or she occupies to be used by an invitee under 21 years of age and:
        (1) the person occupying the residence knows that any
    	
such person under the age of 21 is in possession of or is consuming any alcoholic beverage; and
        (2) the possession or consumption of the alcohol by
    	
the person under 21 is not otherwise permitted by this Act.
    For the purposes of this subsection (c) where the residence has an owner and a tenant or lessee, the trier of fact may infer that the residence is occupied only by the tenant or lessee. The sentence of any person who violates this subsection (c) shall include, but shall not be limited to, a fine of not less than $500. Where a violation of this subsection (c) directly or indirectly results in great bodily harm or death to any person, the person violating this subsection (c) shall be guilty of a Class 4 felony. Nothing in this subsection (c) shall be construed to prohibit the giving of alcoholic liquor to a person under the age of 21 years in the performance of a religious ceremony or service in observation of a religious holiday.
    A person shall not be in violation of this subsection (c) if (A) he or she requests assistance from the police department or other law enforcement agency to either (i) remove any person who refuses to abide by the person's performance of the duties imposed by this subsection (c) or (ii) terminate the activity because the person has been unable to prevent a person under the age of 21 years from consuming alcohol despite having taken all reasonable steps to do so and (B) this assistance is requested before any other person makes a formal complaint to the police department or other law enforcement agency about the activity.
    (d) Any person who rents a hotel or motel room from the proprietor or agent thereof for the purpose of or with the knowledge that such room shall be used for the consumption of alcoholic liquor by persons under the age of 21 years shall be guilty of a Class A misdemeanor.
    (e) Except as otherwise provided in this Act, any person who has alcoholic liquor in his or her possession on public school district property on school days or at events on public school district property when children are present is guilty of a petty offense, unless the alcoholic liquor (i) is in the original container with the seal unbroken and is in the possession of a person who is not otherwise legally prohibited from possessing the alcoholic liquor or (ii) is in the possession of a person in or for the performance of a religious service or ceremony authorized by the school board.

    Sec. 6-16.1. Enforcement actions.
    (a) A licensee or an officer, associate, member, representative, agent, or employee of a licensee may sell, give, or deliver alcoholic liquor to a person under the age of 21 years or authorize the sale, gift, or delivery of alcoholic liquor to a person under the age of 21 years pursuant to a plan or action to investigate, patrol, or otherwise conduct a "sting operation" or enforcement action against a person employed by the licensee or on any licensed premises if the licensee or officer, associate, member, representative, agent, or employee of the licensee provides written notice, at least 14 days before the "sting operation" or enforcement action, unless governing body of the municipality or county having jurisdiction sets a shorter period by ordinance, to the law enforcement agency having jurisdiction, the local liquor control commissioner, or both. Notice provided under this Section shall be valid for a "sting operation" or enforcement action conducted within 60 days of the provision of that notice, unless the governing body of the municipality or county having jurisdiction sets a shorter period by ordinance.
    (b) A local liquor control commission or unit of local government that conducts alcohol and tobacco compliance operations shall establish a policy and standards for alcohol and tobacco compliance operations to investigate whether a licensee is furnishing (1) alcoholic liquor to persons under 21 years of age in violation of this Act or (2) tobacco to persons in violation of the Prevention of Tobacco Use by Persons under 21 Years of Age and Sale and Distribution of Tobacco Products Act.
    (c) The Illinois Law Enforcement Training Standards Board shall develop a model policy and guidelines for the operation of alcohol and tobacco compliance checks by local law enforcement officers. The Illinois Law Enforcement Training Standards Board shall also require the supervising officers of such compliance checks to have met a minimum training standard as determined by the Board. The Board shall have the right to waive any training based on current written policies and procedures for alcohol and tobacco compliance check operations and in-service training already administered by the local law enforcement agency, department, or office.
    (d) The provisions of subsections (b) and (c) do not apply to a home rule unit with more than 2,000,000 inhabitants.
    (e) A home rule unit, other than a home rule unit with more than 2,000,000 inhabitants, may not regulate enforcement actions in a manner inconsistent with the regulation of enforcement actions under this Section. This subsection (e) is a limitation under subsection (i) of Section 6 of Article VII of the Illinois Constitution on the concurrent exercise by home rule units of powers and functions exercised by the State.
    (f) A licensee who is the subject of an enforcement action or "sting operation" under this Section and is found, pursuant to the enforcement action, to be in compliance with this Act shall be notified by the enforcement agency action that no violation was found within 30 days after the finding.

    Sec. 6-16.2. Prohibited entry to a licensed premises. A municipality or county may prohibit a licensee or any officer, associate, member, representative, agent, or employee of a licensee from permitting a person under the age of 21 years to enter and remain in that portion of a licensed premises that sells, gives, or delivers alcoholic liquor for consumption on the premises. No prohibition under this Section, however, shall apply to any licensed premises, such as without limitation a restaurant or food shop, where selling, giving, or delivering alcoholic liquor is not the principal business of the licensee at those premises.
    In those instances where a person under the age of 21 years is prohibited from entering and remaining on the premises, proof that the defendant-licensee, or his employee or agent, demanded, was shown, and reasonably relied upon adequate written evidence for purposes of entering and remaining on the licensed premises is an affirmative defense in any criminal prosecution therefor or to any proceedings for the suspension or revocation of any license based thereon. It shall not, however, be an affirmative defense if the defendant-licensee, or his agent or employee, accepted the written evidence knowing it to be false or fraudulent.
    Adequate written evidence of age and identity of the person is a document issued by a federal, state, county, or municipal government, or subdivision or agency thereof, including, but not limited to, a motor vehicle operator's license, a registration certificate issued under the Federal Selective Service Act, or an identification card issued to a member of the armed forces.
    If a false or fraudulent Illinois driver's license or Illinois identification card is presented by a person less than 21 years of age to a licensee or the licensee's agent or employee for the purpose of obtaining entry and remaining on a licensed premises, the law enforcement officer or agency investigating the incident shall, upon the conviction of the person who presented the fraudulent license or identification, make a report of the matter to the Secretary of State on a form provided by the Secretary of State.

    A distributor or importing distributor designated as a distributor or importing distributor for alcoholic liquor within a designated geographic area or areas under Section 6-9 of this Act shall use its best efforts to make available for sale to retail licensees, in its designated geographic area or areas, each brand of alcoholic liquor which the distributor or the importing distributor has been authorized to distribute. Nothing in this Section prohibits a distributor or importing distributor from establishing purchase requirements unless the requirements have the effect of excluding a majority of the retail licensees in the designated geographic area or areas from purchasing the alcoholic liquor.

    (a) Any person to whom the sale, gift or delivery of any alcoholic liquor is prohibited because of age shall not purchase, or accept a gift of such alcoholic liquor or have such alcoholic liquor in his possession.
    (b) If a licensee or his or her agents or employees believes or has reason to believe that a sale or delivery of any alcoholic liquor is prohibited because of the non-age of the prospective recipient, he or she shall, before making such sale or delivery demand presentation of some form of positive identification, containing proof of age, issued by a public officer in the performance of his or her official duties.
    (c) No person shall transfer, alter, or deface such an identification card; use the identification card of another; carry or use a false or forged identification card; or obtain an identification card by means of false information.

    (i) A law enforcement officer may not charge or otherwise take a person into custody based solely on the commission of an offense that involves alcohol and violates subsection (d) or (e) of this Section if the law enforcement officer, after making a reasonable determination and considering the facts and surrounding circumstances, reasonably believes that all of the following apply:

    (235 ILCS 5/6-21) (from Ch. 43, par. 135)
    Sec. 6-21. (a) Every person who is injured within this State, in person or property, by any intoxicated person has a right of action in his or her own name, severally or jointly, against any person, licensed under the laws of this State or of any other state to sell alcoholic liquor, who, by selling or giving alcoholic liquor, within or without the territorial limits of this State, causes the intoxication of such person. Any person at least 21 years of age who pays for a hotel or motel room or facility knowing that the room or facility is to be used by any person under 21 years of age for the unlawful consumption of alcoholic liquors and such consumption causes the intoxication of the person under 21 years of age, shall be liable to any person who is injured in person or property by the intoxicated person under 21 years of age. Any person owning, renting, leasing or permitting the occupation of any building or premises with knowledge that alcoholic liquors are to be sold therein, or who having leased the same for other purposes, shall knowingly permit therein the sale of any alcoholic liquors that have caused the intoxication of any person, shall be liable, severally or jointly, with the person selling or giving the liquors. However, if such building or premises belong to a minor or other person under guardianship the guardian of such person shall be held liable instead of the ward. A married woman has the same right to bring the action and to control it and the amount recovered as an unmarried woman. All damages recovered by a minor under this Act shall be paid either to the minor, or to his or her parent, guardian or next friend as the court shall direct. The unlawful sale or gift of alcoholic liquor works a forfeiture of all rights of the lessee or tenant under any lease or contract of rent upon the premises where the unlawful sale or gift takes place. All actions for damages under this Act may be by any appropriate action in the circuit court. An action shall lie for injuries to either means of support or loss of society, but not both, caused by an intoxicated person or in consequence of the intoxication of any person resulting as hereinabove set out. "Loss of society" means the mutual benefits that each family member receives from the other's continued existence, including love, affection, care, attention, companionship, comfort, guidance, and protection. "Family" includes spouse, children, parents, brothers, and sisters. The action, if the person from whom support or society was furnished is living, shall be brought by any person injured in means of support or society in his or her name for his or her benefit and the benefit of all other persons injured in means of support or society. However, any person claiming to be injured in means of support or society and not included in any action brought hereunder may join by motion made within the times herein provided for bringing such action or the personal representative of the deceased person from whom such support or society was furnished may so join. In every such action the jury shall determine the amount of damages to be recovered without regard to and with no special instructions as to the dollar limits on recovery imposed by this Section. The amount recovered in every such action is for the exclusive benefit of the person injured in loss of support or society and shall be distributed to such persons in the proportions determined by the verdict rendered or judgment entered in the action. If the right of action is settled by agreement with the personal representative of a deceased person from whom support or society was furnished, the court having jurisdiction of the estate of the deceased person shall distribute the amount of the settlement to the person injured in loss of support or society in the proportion, as determined by the court, that the percentage of dependency of each such person upon the deceased person bears to the sum of the percentages of dependency of all such persons upon the deceased person. For all causes of action involving persons injured, killed, or incurring property damage before September 12, 1985, in no event shall the judgment or recovery under this Act for injury to the person or to the property of any person as hereinabove set out exceed $15,000, and recovery under this Act for loss of means of support resulting from the death or injury of any person, as hereinabove set out, shall not exceed $20,000. For all causes of action involving persons injured, killed, or incurring property damage after September 12, 1985 but before July 1, 1998, in no event shall the judgment or recovery for injury to the person or property of any person exceed $30,000 for each person incurring damages, and recovery under this Act for loss of means of support resulting from the death or injury of any person shall not exceed $40,000. For all causes of action involving persons injured, killed, or incurring property damage on or after July 1, 1998, in no event shall the judgment or recovery for injury to the person or property of any person exceed $45,000 for each person incurring damages, and recovery under this Act for either loss of means of support or loss of society resulting from the death or injury of any person shall not exceed $55,000. Beginning in 1999, every January 20, these liability limits shall automatically be increased or decreased, as applicable, by a percentage equal to the percentage change in the consumer price index-u during the preceding 12-month calendar year. "Consumer price index-u" means the index published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics of the United States Department of Labor that measures the average change in prices of goods and services purchased by all urban consumers, United States city average, all items, 1982-84 = 100. The new amount resulting from each annual adjustment shall be determined by the Comptroller and made available via the Comptroller's official website by January 31 of every year and to the chief judge of each judicial circuit. The liability limits at the time at which damages subject to such limits are awarded by final judgment or settlement shall be utilized by the courts. Nothing in this Section bars any person from making separate claims which, in the aggregate, exceed any one limit where such person incurs more than one type of compensable damage, including personal injury, property damage, and loss to means of support or society. However, all persons claiming loss to means of support or society shall be limited to an aggregate recovery not to exceed the single limitation set forth herein for the death or injury of each person from whom support or society is claimed.
    Nothing in this Act shall be construed to confer a cause of action for injuries to the person or property of the intoxicated person himself, nor shall anything in this Act be construed to confer a cause of action for loss of means of support or society on the intoxicated person himself or on any person claiming to be supported by such intoxicated person or claiming the society of such person. In conformance with the rule of statutory construction enunciated in the general Illinois saving provision in Section 4 of "An Act to revise the law in relation to the construction of the statutes", approved March 5, 1874, as amended, no amendment of this Section purporting to abolish or having the effect of abolishing a cause of action shall be applied to invalidate a cause of action accruing before its effective date, irrespective of whether the amendment was passed before or after the effective date of this amendatory Act of 1986.
    Each action hereunder shall be barred unless commenced within one year next after the cause of action accrued.
    However, a licensed distributor or brewer whose only connection with the furnishing of alcoholic liquor which is alleged to have caused intoxication was the furnishing or maintaining of any apparatus for the dispensing or cooling of beer is not liable under this Section, and if such licensee is named as a defendant, a proper motion to dismiss shall be granted.
    (b) Any person licensed under any state or local law to sell alcoholic liquor, whether or not a citizen or resident of this State, who in person or through an agent causes the intoxication, by the sale or gift of alcoholic liquor, of any person who, while intoxicated, causes injury to any person or property in the State of Illinois thereby submits such licensed person, and, if an individual, his or her personal representative, to the jurisdiction of the courts of this State for a cause of action arising under subsection (a) above.
    Service of process upon any person who is subject to the jurisdiction of the courts of this State, as provided in this subsection, may be made by personally serving the summons upon the defendant outside this State, as provided in the Code of Civil Procedure, as now or hereafter amended, with the same force and effect as though summons had been personally served within this State.
    Only causes of action arising under subsection (a) above may be asserted against a defendant in an action in which jurisdiction over him or her is based upon this subsection.
    Nothing herein contained limits or affects the right to serve any process in any other manner now or hereafter provided by law.

    (a) The General Assembly finds that there is a need for public information about the risk of birth defects (specifically Fetal Alcohol Syndrome) when women consume alcoholic liquor during pregnancy. The United States Surgeon General has recommended abstinence from alcohol during pregnancy. Since Fetal Alcohol Syndrome and fetal alcohol effects are preventable, the General Assembly finds that it is in the public interest to provide warning about the risk of alcohol-related birth defects at places where alcoholic liquors are sold.
    (b) Every holder of a retail license, whether the licensee sells or offers for sale alcoholic liquors for use or consumption on or off the retail license premises, shall cause a sign with the message "GOVERNMENT WARNING: ACCORDING TO THE SURGEON GENERAL, WOMEN SHOULD NOT DRINK ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGES DURING PREGNANCY BECAUSE OF THE RISK OF BIRTH DEFECTS. IF YOU NEED ASSISTANCE FOR SUBSTANCE ABUSE, PLEASE CALL THE OFFICE OF ALCOHOLISM AND SUBSTANCE ABUSE (OASA) AT 1-800-843-6154." to be framed and hung in plain view. These signs shall be no larger than 8 1/2 inches by 11 inches.
    (c) In the event there is no warning sign posted on the retailer's premises, it shall be the responsibility of the Illinois Liquor Control Commission to furnish the retailer with a warning sign. The retailer shall have 30 days from receipt of the warning sign to post it on the licensed premises. Thereafter, a retailer who violates this Section is subject to a written warning for the first violation. For a second or subsequent violation, the retailer shall pay a fine of at least $20 but not more than $100 for each such violation. For the third and subsequent violations, each day the activity continues shall be a separate violation.

    Sec. 6-27.1. Responsible alcohol service server training.
    (a) Unless issued a valid server training certificate between July 1, 2012 and July 1, 2015 by a certified Beverage Alcohol Sellers and Servers Education and Training (BASSET) trainer, all alcohol servers in Cook County are required to obtain and complete training in basic responsible alcohol service as outlined in 77 Ill. Adm. Code 3500, as those provisions exist on July 1, 2015 (the effective date of Public Act 98-939), by July 1, 2015 or within 120 days after the alcohol server begins his or her employment, whichever is later. All alcohol servers in a county, other than Cook County, with a population of 200,000 inhabitants or more are required to obtain and complete training in basic responsible alcohol service as outlined in 77 Ill. Adm. Code 3500, as those provisions exist on July 1, 2015 (the effective date of Public Act 98-939), by July 1, 2016 or within 120 days after the alcohol server begins his or her employment, whichever is later. All alcohol servers in a county with a population of more than 30,000 inhabitants and less than 200,000 inhabitants are required to obtain and complete training in basic responsible alcohol service as outlined in 77 Ill. Adm. Code 3500, as those provisions exist on July 1, 2015 (the effective date of Public Act 98-939), by July 1, 2017 or within 120 days after the alcohol server begins his or her employment, whichever is later. All alcohol servers in counties with a population of 30,000 inhabitants or less are required to obtain and complete training in basic responsible alcohol service as outlined in 77 Ill. Adm.

    There is no limit to the amount of times a server may take the training. A certificate of training belongs to the server, and a server may transfer a certificate of training to a different employer, but shall not transfer a certificate of training to another server. Proof that an alcohol server has been trained must be available upon reasonable request by State law enforcement officials. For the purpose of this Section, "alcohol servers" means persons who sell or serve open containers of alcoholic beverages at retail, anyone who delivers mixed drinks under Section 6-28.8, and anyone whose job description entails the checking of identification for the purchase of open containers of alcoholic beverages at retail or for entry into the licensed premises. The definition does not include (i) a distributor or importing distributor conducting product sampling as authorized in Section 6-31 of this Act or a registered tasting representative, as provided in 11 Ill. Adm. Code 100.40, conducting a tasting, as defined in 11 Ill. Adm. Code 100.10; (ii) a volunteer serving alcoholic beverages at a charitable function; or (iii) an instructor engaged in training or educating on the proper technique for using a system that dispenses alcoholic beverages.

    (c) Beginning on the effective date of this amendatory Act of the 98th General Assembly, but no later than October 1, 2015, all existing BASSET trainers who are already BASSET certified as of the effective date of this amendatory Act of the 98th General Assembly shall be recertified by the State Commission and be required to comply with the conditions for server training set forth in this amendatory Act of the 98th General Assembly.
    (d) Training modules and certificate program plans must be approved by the State Commission. All documents, materials, or information related to responsible alcohol service training program approval that are submitted to the State Commission are confidential and shall not be open to public inspection or dissemination and are exempt from disclosure.
    The State Commission shall only approve programs that meet the following criteria:
        (1) the training course covers the content specified
    	
in 77 Ill. Adm. Code 3500.155;
        (2) if the training course is classroom-based, the
    	
classroom training is at least 4 hours, is available in English and Spanish, and includes a test;
        (3) if the training course is online or
    	
computer-based, the course is designed in a way that ensures that no content can be skipped, is interactive, has audio for content for servers that have a disability, and includes a test;
        (4) training and testing is based on a job task
    	
analysis that clearly identifies and focuses on the knowledge, skills, and abilities needed to responsibly serve alcoholic beverages and is developed using best practices in instructional design and exam development to ensure that the program is fair and legally defensible;
        (5) training and testing is conducted by any means
    	
available, including, but not limited to, online, computer, classroom, or live trainers; and
        (6) the program must provide access on a
    	
24-hour-per-day, 7-days-per-week basis for certificate verification for State Commission, State law enforcement officials, and employers to be able to verify certificate authenticity.
    (e) Nothing in subsection (d) of this Section shall be construed to require a program to use a test administrator or proctor.
    (f) A certificate issued from a BASSET-licensed training program shall be accepted as meeting the training requirements for all server license and permit laws and ordinances in the State.
    (g) A responsible alcohol service training certificate from a BASSET-licensed program shall be valid for 3 years.
    (h) The provisions of this Section shall apply beginning July 1, 2015. From July 1, 2015 through December 31, 2015, enforcement of the provisions of this Section shall be limited to education and notification of the requirements to encourage compliance.
    (i) The provisions of this Section do not apply to a special event retailer.

    (a) The General Assembly declares that the following is the intent of this Section:
        (1) To authorize direct shipment of wine by an
    	
out-of-state maker of wine on the same basis permitted an in-state maker of wine pursuant to the authority of the State under the provisions of Section 2 of the Twenty-First Amendment to the United States Constitution and in conformance with the United States Supreme Court decision decided on May 16, 2005 in Granholm v. Heald.
        (2) To reaffirm that the General Assembly's findings
    	
and declarations that selling alcoholic liquor through various direct marketing means such as catalogs, newspapers, mailings, and the Internet directly to consumers of this State poses a serious threat to the State's efforts to further temperance and prevent youth from accessing alcoholic liquor and the expansion of youth access to additional types of alcoholic liquors.
        (3) To maintain the State's broad powers granted by
    	
Section 2 of the Twenty-First Amendment to the United States Constitution to control the importation or sale of alcoholic liquor and its right to structure its alcoholic liquor distribution system.
        (4) To ensure that the General Assembly, by
    	
authorizing limited direct shipment of wine to meet the directives of the United States Supreme Court, does not intend to impair or modify the State's distribution of wine through distributors or importing distributors, but only to permit limited shipment of wine for personal use.
        (5) To provide that, in the event that a court of
    	
competent jurisdiction declares or finds that this Section, which is enacted to conform Illinois law to the United States Supreme Court decision, is invalid or unconstitutional, the Illinois General Assembly at its earliest general session shall conduct hearings and study methods to conform to any directive or order of the court consistent with the temperance and revenue collection purposes of this Act.
    (b) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, a wine shipper licensee may ship, for personal use and not for resale, not more than 12 cases of wine per year to any resident of this State who is 21 years of age or older.
    (b-3) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, sale and shipment by a winery shipper licensee pursuant to this Section shall be deemed to constitute a sale in this State.

SIGNATURE OF A PERSON 21 YEARS OF AGE OR OLDER REQUIRED FOR DELIVERY. PROOF OF AGE AND IDENTITY MUST BE SHOWN BEFORE DELIVERY.". This warning must be prominently displayed on the packaging. A licensee shall require the transporter or common carrier that delivers the wine to obtain the signature of a person 21 years of age or older at the delivery address at the time of delivery. At the expense of the licensee, the licensee shall receive a delivery confirmation from the express company, common carrier, or contract carrier indicating the location of the delivery, time of delivery, and the name and signature of the individual 21 years of age or older who accepts delivery. The Commission shall design and create a label or approve a label that must be affixed to the shipping container by the licensee.
    (c) No broker within this State shall solicit consumers to engage in direct wine shipments under this Section.

    Sec. 6-29.1. Direct shipments of alcoholic liquor.
    (a) The General Assembly makes the following findings:
        (1) The General Assembly of Illinois, having reviewed
    	
this Act in light of the United States Supreme Court's 2005 decision in Granholm v. Heald, has determined to conform that law to the constitutional principles enunciated by the Court in a manner that best preserves the temperance, revenue, and orderly distribution values of this Act.
        (2) Minimizing automobile accidents and fatalities,
    	
domestic violence, health problems, loss of productivity, unemployment, and other social problems associated with dependency and improvident use of alcoholic beverages remains the policy of Illinois.
        (3) To the maximum extent constitutionally feasible,
    	
Illinois desires to collect sufficient revenue from excise and use taxes on alcoholic beverages for the purpose of responding to such social problems.
        (4) Combined with family education and individual
    	
discipline, retail validation of age, and assessment of the capacity of the consumer remains the best pre-sale social protection against the problems associated with the abuse of alcoholic liquor.
        (5) Therefore, the paramount purpose of this
    	
amendatory Act is to continue to carefully limit direct shipment sales of wine produced by makers of wine and to continue to prohibit such direct shipment sales for spirits and beer.
    For these reasons, the Commission shall establish a system to notify the out-of-state trade of this prohibition and to detect violations. The Commission shall request the Attorney General to extradite any offender.
    (b) Pursuant to the Twenty-First Amendment of the United States Constitution allowing states to regulate the distribution and sale of alcoholic liquor and pursuant to the federal Webb-Kenyon Act declaring that alcoholic liquor shipped in interstate commerce must comply with state laws, the General Assembly hereby finds and declares that selling alcoholic liquor from a point outside this State through various direct marketing means, such as catalogs, newspapers, mailers, and the Internet, directly to residents of this State poses a serious threat to the State's efforts to prevent youths from accessing alcoholic liquor; to State revenue collections; and to the economy of this State.
    Any person manufacturing, distributing, or selling alcoholic liquor who knowingly ships or transports or causes the shipping or transportation of any alcoholic liquor from a point outside this State to a person in this State who does not hold a manufacturer's, distributor's, importing distributor's, or non-resident dealer's license issued by the Liquor Control Commission, other than a shipment of sacramental wine to a bona fide religious organization, a shipment authorized by Section 6-29, subparagraph (17) of Section 3-12, or any other shipment authorized by this Act, is in violation of this Act.
    The Commission, upon determining, after investigation, that a person has violated this Section, shall give notice to the person by certified mail to cease and desist all shipments of alcoholic liquor into this State and to withdraw from this State within 5 working days after receipt of the notice all shipments of alcoholic liquor then in transit. A person who violates the cease and desist notice is subject to the applicable penalties in subsection (a) of Section 10-1 of this Act.

    (235 ILCS 5/7-9) (from Ch. 43, par. 153)
    Sec. 7-9. Except as provided in this Section, any order or action of a local liquor control commissioner levying a fine or refusing to levy a fine on a licensee, granting or refusing to grant a license, revoking or suspending or refusing to revoke or suspend a license or refusing for more than 30 days to grant a hearing upon a complaint to revoke or suspend a license may, within 20 days after notice of such order or action, be appealed by any resident of the political subdivision under the jurisdiction of the local liquor control commissioner or any person interested, to the State Commission.
    In any case where a licensee appeals to the State Commission from an order or action of the local liquor control commission having the effect of suspending or revoking a license, denying a renewal application, or refusing to grant a license, the licensee shall resume the operation of the licensed business pending the decision of the State Commission and the expiration of the time allowed for an application for rehearing. If an application for rehearing is filed, the licensee shall continue the operation of the licensed business until the denial of the application or, if the rehearing is granted, until the decision on rehearing.
    In any case in which a licensee appeals to the State Commission a suspension or revocation by a local liquor control commissioner that is the second or subsequent such suspension or revocation placed on that licensee within the preceding 12 month period, the licensee shall consider the suspension or revocation to be in effect until a reversal of the local liquor control commissioner's action has been issued by the State Commission and shall cease all activity otherwise authorized by the license. The State Commission shall expedite, to the greatest extent possible, its consideration of any appeal that is an appeal of a second or subsequent suspension or revocation within the past 12 month period.
    The appeal shall be limited to a review of the official record of the proceedings of such local liquor control commissioner if the county board, city council or board of trustees, as the case may be, has adopted a resolution requiring that such review be on the record. If such resolution is adopted, a certified official record of the proceedings taken and prepared by a certified court reporter or certified shorthand reporter shall be filed by the local liquor control commissioner within 5 days after notice of the filing of such appeal, if the appellant licensee pays for the cost of the transcript. The State Commission shall review the propriety of the order or action of the local liquor control commissioner and shall consider the following questions:
        (a) whether the local liquor control commissioner has
    	
proceeded in the manner provided by law;
        (b) whether the order is supported by the findings;
        (c) whether the findings are supported by substantial
    	
evidence in the light of the whole record.
    The only evidence which may be considered in the review, shall be the evidence found in the certified official record of the proceedings of the local liquor control commissioner. No new or additional evidence shall be admitted or considered. The State Commission shall render a decision affirming, reversing or modifying the order or action reviewed within 30 days after the appeal was heard.
    In the event such appeal is from an order of a local liquor control commissioner of a city, village or incorporated town of 500,000 or more inhabitants, granting or refusing to grant a license or refusing for more than 30 days to grant a hearing upon a complaint to revoke or suspend a license, the matter of the propriety of such order or action shall be tried de novo by the license appeal commission as expeditiously as circumstances permit.
    In the event such appeal is from an order or action of a local liquor control commissioner of a city, village or incorporated town of 500,000 or more inhabitants, imposing a fine or refusing to impose a fine on a licensee, revoking or suspending or refusing to revoke or suspend a license, the license appeal commission shall determine the appeal by a review of the official record of the proceedings of such local liquor control commissioner. A certified record of the proceedings shall be promptly filed with the license appeal commission by such local liquor control commissioner after notice of the filing of such appeal if the appellant licensee pays for the cost of the transcript and promptly delivers the transcript to the local liquor control commission or its attorney. The review by the license appeal commission shall be limited to the questions:
        (a) whether the local liquor control commissioner has
    	
proceeded in the manner provided by law;
        (b) whether the order is supported by the findings;
        (c) whether the findings are supported by substantial
    	
evidence in the light of the whole record.
No new or additional evidence in support of or in opposition to such order or action under appeal shall be received other than that contained in such record of the proceedings. Within 30 days after such appeal was heard, the license appeal commission shall render its decision in accordance with the provisions of Section 7-5.
    In cities, villages and incorporated towns having a population of 500,000 or more inhabitants, appeals from any order or action shall lie to the license appeal commission of such city, village or incorporated town. All of the provisions of this Section and Section 7-10 relative to proceedings upon appeals before the State Commission and relative to appeals from the decisions of the State Commission shall apply also to proceedings upon appeals before any license appeal commission and appeals from the decisions of license appeal commission.
    In any trial de novo hearing before the State Commission or license appeal commission, the local liquor control commissioner shall be entitled to 10 days notice and to be heard. All such trial de novo hearings shall be open to the public and the Illinois Liquor Control Commission and the license appeal commission shall reduce all evidence offered thereto to writing.
    If after trial de novo hearing or review as provided herein, the State Commission or the license appeal commission (as the case may be) shall decide that the license has been improperly issued, denied, revoked, suspended or refused to be revoked or suspended or a hearing to revoke or suspend has been improperly refused or that the licensee has been improperly fined or not fined, it shall enter an order in conformity with such findings, which order shall be in writing.
    A certified copy of the order shall be transmitted to the particular local liquor control commissioner and it shall be the duty of the local liquor control commissioner to take such action as may be necessary to conform with the order.
    In any trial de novo hearing before the State Commission or the license appeal commission, the licensee shall submit to examination and produce books and records material to the business conducted under the license in like manner as before the local liquor control commissioner, and the failure of the licensee to submit to such an examination or to produce such books and records, or to appear at the hearing on such appeal, shall constitute an admission that he has violated the provisions of this Act. In the event the appeal is from an order of the local liquor control commissioner denying a renewal application, the licensee shall have on deposit with the local liquor control commissioner an amount sufficient to cover the license fee for the renewal period and any bond that may be required.

    (235 ILCS 5/Art. VIII heading)
ARTICLE VIII. TAXATION OF LIQUOR

    (235 ILCS 5/8-1)
    Sec. 8-1. A tax is imposed upon the privilege of engaging in business as a manufacturer or as an importing distributor of alcoholic liquor other than beer at the rate of $0.185 per gallon until September 1, 2009 and $0.231 per gallon beginning September 1, 2009 for cider containing not less than 0.5% alcohol by volume nor more than 7% alcohol by volume, $0.73 per gallon until September 1, 2009 and $1.39 per gallon beginning September 1, 2009 for wine other than cider containing less than 7% alcohol by volume, and $4.50 per gallon until September 1, 2009 and $8.55 per gallon beginning September 1, 2009 on alcohol and spirits manufactured and sold or used by such manufacturer, or as agent for any other person, or sold or used by such importing distributor, or as agent for any other person. A tax is imposed upon the privilege of engaging in business as a manufacturer of beer or as an importing distributor of beer at the rate of $0.185 per gallon until September 1, 2009 and $0.231 per gallon beginning September 1, 2009 on all beer, regardless of alcohol by volume, manufactured and sold or used by such manufacturer, or as agent for any other person, or sold or used by such importing distributor, or as agent for any other person. Any brewer manufacturing beer in this State shall be entitled to and given a credit or refund of 75% of the tax imposed on each gallon of beer up to 4.9 million gallons per year in any given calendar year for tax paid or payable on beer produced and sold in the State of Illinois.
    For purposes of this Section, "beer" means beer, ale, porter, stout, and other similar fermented beverages of any name or description containing one-half of one percent or more of alcohol by volume, brewed or produced from malt, wholly or in part, or from any substitute for malt.
    For the purpose of this Section, "cider" means any alcoholic beverage obtained by the alcohol fermentation of the juice of apples or pears including, but not limited to, flavored, sparkling, or carbonated cider.
    The credit or refund created by this Act shall apply to all beer taxes in the calendar years 1982 through 1986.
    The increases made by this amendatory Act of the 91st General Assembly in the rates of taxes imposed under this Section shall apply beginning on July 1, 1999.
    A tax at the rate of 1¢ per gallon on beer and 48¢ per gallon on alcohol and spirits is also imposed upon the privilege of engaging in business as a retailer or as a distributor who is not also an importing distributor with respect to all beer and all alcohol and spirits owned or possessed by such retailer or distributor when this amendatory Act of 1969 becomes effective, and with respect to which the additional tax imposed by this amendatory Act upon manufacturers and importing distributors does not apply. Retailers and distributors who are subject to the additional tax imposed by this paragraph of this Section shall be required to inventory such alcoholic liquor and to pay this additional tax in a manner prescribed by the Department.
    The provisions of this Section shall be construed to apply to any importing distributor engaging in business in this State, whether licensed or not.
    However, such tax is not imposed upon any such business as to any alcoholic liquor shipped outside Illinois by an Illinois licensed manufacturer or importing distributor, nor as to any alcoholic liquor delivered in Illinois by an Illinois licensed manufacturer or importing distributor to a purchaser for immediate transportation by the purchaser to another state into which the purchaser has a legal right, under the laws of such state, to import such alcoholic liquor, nor as to any alcoholic liquor other than beer sold by one Illinois licensed manufacturer or importing distributor to another Illinois licensed manufacturer or importing distributor to the extent to which the sale of alcoholic liquor other than beer by one Illinois licensed manufacturer or importing distributor to another Illinois licensed manufacturer or importing distributor is authorized by the licensing provisions of this Act, nor to alcoholic liquor whether manufactured in or imported into this State when sold to a "non-beverage user" licensed by the State for use in the manufacture of any of the following when they are unfit for beverage purposes:
    Patent and proprietary medicines and medicinal, antiseptic, culinary and toilet preparations;
    Flavoring extracts and syrups and food products;
    Scientific, industrial and chemical products, excepting denatured alcohol;
    Or for scientific, chemical, experimental or mechanical purposes;
    Nor is the tax imposed upon the privilege of engaging in any business in interstate commerce or otherwise, which business may not, under the Constitution and Statutes of the United States, be made the subject of taxation by this State.
    The tax herein imposed shall be in addition to all other occupation or privilege taxes imposed by the State of Illinois or political subdivision thereof.
    If any alcoholic liquor manufactured in or imported into this State is sold to a licensed manufacturer or importing distributor by a licensed manufacturer or importing distributor to be used solely as an ingredient in the manufacture of any beverage for human consumption, the tax imposed upon such purchasing manufacturer or importing distributor shall be reduced by the amount of the taxes which have been paid by the selling manufacturer or importing distributor under this Act as to such alcoholic liquor so used to the Department of Revenue.
    If any person received any alcoholic liquors from a manufacturer or importing distributor, with respect to which alcoholic liquors no tax is imposed under this Article, and such alcoholic liquor shall thereafter be disposed of in such manner or under such circumstances as may cause the same to become the base for the tax imposed by this Article, such person shall make the same reports and returns, pay the same taxes and be subject to all other provisions of this Article relating to manufacturers and importing distributors.
    Nothing in this Article shall be construed to require the payment to the Department of the taxes imposed by this Article more than once with respect to any quantity of alcoholic liquor sold or used within this State.
    No tax is imposed by this Act on sales of alcoholic liquor by Illinois licensed foreign importers to Illinois licensed importing distributors.
    All of the proceeds of the additional tax imposed by Public Act 96-34 shall be deposited by the Department into the Capital Projects Fund. The remainder of the tax imposed by this Act shall be deposited by the Department into the General Revenue Fund.
    A manufacturer of beer that imports or transfers beer into this State must comply with the provisions of this Section with regard to the beer imported into this State.
    The provisions of this Section 8-1 are severable under Section 1.31 of the Statute on Statutes.

    (235 ILCS 5/8-2) (from Ch. 43, par. 159)
    Sec. 8-2. Payments; reports. It is the duty of each manufacturer with respect to alcoholic liquor produced or imported by such manufacturer, or purchased tax-free by such manufacturer from another manufacturer or importing distributor, and of each importing distributor as to alcoholic liquor purchased by such importing distributor from foreign importers or from anyone from any point in the United States outside of this State or purchased tax-free from another manufacturer or importing distributor, to pay the tax imposed by Section 8-1 to the Department of Revenue on or before the 15th day of the calendar month following the calendar month in which such alcoholic liquor is sold or used by such manufacturer or by such importing distributor other than in an authorized tax-free manner or to pay that tax electronically as provided in this Section.
    Each manufacturer and each importing distributor shall make payment under one of the following methods: (1) on or before the 15th day of each calendar month, file in person or by United States first-class mail, postage pre-paid, with the Department of Revenue, on forms prescribed and furnished by the Department, a report in writing in such form as may be required by the Department in order to compute, and assure the accuracy of, the tax due on all taxable sales and uses of alcoholic liquor occurring during the preceding month. Payment of the tax in the amount disclosed by the report shall accompany the report or, (2) on or before the 15th day of each calendar month, electronically file with the Department of Revenue, on forms prescribed and furnished by the Department, an electronic report in such form as may be required by the Department in order to compute, and assure the accuracy of, the tax due on all taxable sales and uses of alcoholic liquor occurring during the preceding month. An electronic payment of the tax in the amount disclosed by the report shall accompany the report. A manufacturer or distributor who files an electronic report and electronically pays the tax imposed pursuant to Section 8-1 to the Department of Revenue on or before the 15th day of the calendar month following the calendar month in which such alcoholic liquor is sold or used by that manufacturer or importing distributor other than in an authorized tax-free manner shall pay to the Department the amount of the tax imposed pursuant to Section 8-1, less a discount which is allowed to reimburse the manufacturer or importing distributor for the expenses incurred in keeping and maintaining records, preparing and filing the electronic returns, remitting the tax, and supplying data to the Department upon request.
    The discount shall be in an amount as follows:
        (1) For original returns due on or after January 1,
    	
2003 through September 30, 2003, the discount shall be 1.75% or $1,250 per return, whichever is less;
        (2) For original returns due on or after October 1,
    	
2003 through September 30, 2004, the discount shall be 2% or $3,000 per return, whichever is less; and
        (3) For original returns due on or after October 1,
    	
2004, the discount shall be 2% or $2,000 per return, whichever is less.
    The Department may, if it deems it necessary in order to insure the payment of the tax imposed by this Article, require returns to be made more frequently than and covering periods of less than a month. Such return shall contain such further information as the Department may reasonably require.
    It shall be presumed that all alcoholic liquors acquired or made by any importing distributor or manufacturer have been sold or used by him in this State and are the basis for the tax imposed by this Article unless proven, to the satisfaction of the Department, that such alcoholic liquors are (1) still in the possession of such importing distributor or manufacturer, or (2) prior to the termination of possession have been lost by theft or through unintentional destruction, or (3) that such alcoholic liquors are otherwise exempt from taxation under this Act.
    If any payment provided for in this Section exceeds the manufacturer's or importing distributor's liabilities under this Act, as shown on an original report, the manufacturer or importing distributor may credit such excess payment against liability subsequently to be remitted to the Department under this Act, in accordance with reasonable rules adopted by the Department. If the Department subsequently determines that all or any part of the credit taken was not actually due to the manufacturer or importing distributor, the manufacturer's or importing distributor's discount shall be reduced by an amount equal to the difference between the discount as applied to the credit taken and that actually due, and the manufacturer or importing distributor shall be liable for penalties and interest on such difference.
    The Department may require any foreign importer to file monthly information returns, by the 15th day of the month following the month which any such return covers, if the Department determines this to be necessary to the proper performance of the Department's functions and duties under this Act. Such return shall contain such information as the Department may reasonably require.
    Every manufacturer and importing distributor, except for a manufacturer or importing distributor that in the preceding year had less than $50,000 of tax liability under this Article, shall also file, with the Department, a bond in an amount not less than $1,000 and not to exceed $100,000 on a form to be approved by, and with a surety or sureties satisfactory to, the Department. Such bond shall be conditioned upon the manufacturer or importing distributor paying to the Department all monies becoming due from such manufacturer or importing distributor under this Article. The Department shall fix the penalty of such bond in each case, taking into consideration the amount of alcoholic liquor expected to be sold and used by such manufacturer or importing distributor, and the penalty fixed by the Department shall be sufficient, in the Department's opinion, to protect the State of Illinois against failure to pay any amount due under this Article, but the amount of the penalty fixed by the Department shall not exceed twice the amount of tax liability of a monthly return, nor shall the amount of such penalty be less than $1,000. The Department shall notify the State Commission of the Department's approval or disapproval of any such manufacturer's or importing distributor's bond, or of the termination or cancellation of any such bond, or of the Department's direction to a manufacturer or importing distributor that he must file additional bond in order to comply with this Section. The Commission shall not issue a license to any applicant for a manufacturer's or importing distributor's license unless the Commission has received a notification from the Department showing that such applicant has filed a satisfactory bond with the Department hereunder and that such bond has been approved by the Department. Failure by any licensed manufacturer or importing distributor to keep a satisfactory bond in effect with the Department or to furnish additional bond to the Department, when required hereunder by the Department to do so, shall be grounds for the revocation or suspension of such manufacturer's or importing distributor's license by the Commission. If a manufacturer or importing distributor fails to pay any amount due under this Article, his bond with the Department shall be deemed forfeited, and the Department may institute a suit in its own name on such bond.
    After notice and opportunity for a hearing the State Commission may revoke or suspend the license of any manufacturer or importing distributor who fails to comply with the provisions of this Section. Notice of such hearing and the time and place thereof shall be in writing and shall contain a statement of the charges against the licensee. Such notice may be given by United States registered or certified mail with return receipt requested, addressed to the person concerned at his last known address and shall be given not less than 7 days prior to the date fixed for the hearing. An order revoking or suspending a license under the provisions of this Section may be reviewed in the manner provided in Section 7-10 of this Act. No new license shall be granted to a person whose license has been revoked for a violation of this Section or, in case of suspension, shall such suspension be terminated until he has paid to the Department all taxes and penalties which he owes the State under the provisions of this Act.
    Every manufacturer or importing distributor who has, as verified by the Department, continuously complied with the conditions of the bond under this Act for a period of 2 years shall be considered to be a prior continuous compliance taxpayer. In determining the consecutive period of time for qualification as a prior continuous compliance taxpayer, any consecutive period of time of qualifying compliance immediately prior to the effective date of this amendatory Act of 1987 shall be credited to any manufacturer or importing distributor.
    A manufacturer or importing distributor that is a prior continuous compliance taxpayer under this Section and becomes a successor as the result of an acquisition, merger, or consolidation of a manufacturer or importing distributor shall be deemed to be a prior continuous compliance taxpayer with respect to the acquired, merged, or consolidated entity.
    Every prior continuous compliance taxpayer shall be exempt from the bond requirements of this Act until the Department has determined the taxpayer to be delinquent in the filing of any return or deficient in the payment of any tax under this Act. Any taxpayer who fails to pay an admitted or established liability under this Act may also be required to post bond or other acceptable security with the Department guaranteeing the payment of such admitted or established liability.
    The Department shall discharge any surety and shall release and return any bond or security deposit assigned, pledged or otherwise provided to it by a taxpayer under this Section within 30 days after: (1) such taxpayer becomes a prior continuous compliance taxpayer; or (2) such taxpayer has ceased to collect receipts on which he is required to remit tax to the Department, has filed a final tax return, and has paid to the Department an amount sufficient to discharge his remaining tax liability as determined by the Department under this Act.

    (235 ILCS 5/8-3) (from Ch. 43, par. 159a)
    Sec. 8-3. If it appears, after claim therefor filed with the Department, that an amount of tax or penalty or interest has been paid which was not due under this Article, whether as the result of a mistake of fact or an error of law, except as hereinafter provided, then the Department shall issue a credit memorandum or refund to the person who made the erroneous payment or, if that person died or became a person under legal disability, to his or her legal representative, as such.
    If it is determined that the Department should issue a credit or refund under this Article, the Department may first apply the amount thereof against any amount of tax or penalty or interest due hereunder from the person entitled to such credit or refund. For this purpose, if proceedings are pending to determine whether or not any tax or penalty or interest is due under this Article from such person, the Department may withhold issuance of the credit or refund pending the final disposition of such proceedings and may apply such credit or refund against any amount found to be due to the Department as a result of such proceedings. The balance, if any, of the credit or refund shall be issued to the person entitled thereto.
    If no tax or penalty or interest is due and no proceeding is pending to determine whether such taxpayer is indebted to the Department for tax or penalty or interest the credit memorandum or refund shall be issued to the claimant; or (in the case of a credit memorandum) the credit memorandum may be assigned and set over by the lawful holder thereof, subject to reasonable rules of the Department, to any other person who is subject to this Article, and the amount thereof shall be applied by the Department against any tax or penalty or interest due or to become due under this Article from such assignee.
    As to any claim filed hereunder with the Department on and after each January 1 and July 1, no amount of tax or penalty or interest, erroneously paid (either in total or partial liquidation of a tax or penalty or interest under this Article) more than 3 years prior to such January 1 and July 1, respectively, shall be credited or refunded.
    Any credit or refund that is allowed under this Act shall bear interest at the rate and in the manner specified in the Uniform Penalty and Interest Act.
    In case the Department determines that the claimant is entitled to a refund, such refund shall be made only from such appropriation as may be available for that purpose. If it appears unlikely that the amount appropriated would permit everyone having a claim allowed during the period covered by such appropriation to elect to receive a cash refund, the Department, by rule or regulation, shall provide for the payment of refunds in hardship cases and shall define what types of cases qualify as hardship cases.

    Sec. 8-4. If a person fails to file a return as required by this Article, or having filed an incorrect or insufficient return, fails to file a corrected or sufficient return, as the case may require, within 10 days after the giving of notice to him by the Department that such corrected or sufficient return is required, the Department shall determine the amount of tax due at any time within 3 years after the making of the earliest disposition of alcoholic liquor included in such determination, and shall give written notice, by means of a notice of tax liability, of such determination to such person. Protest thereto and demand for a hearing may be made and final assessments arrived at in accordance with Section 8-5.

    (235 ILCS 5/8-5) (from Ch. 43, par. 163a)
    Sec. 8-5. As soon as practicable after any return is filed, the Department shall examine such return or amended return and shall correct such return according to its best judgment and information, which return so corrected by the Department shall be prima facie correct and shall be prima facie evidence of the correctness of the amount of tax due, as shown therein. Instead of requiring the licensee to file an amended return, the Department may simply notify the licensee of the correction or corrections it has made. Proof of such correction by the Department, or of the determination of the amount of tax due as provided in Sections 8-4 and 8-10, may be made at any hearing before the Department or in any legal proceeding by a reproduced copy of the Department's record relating thereto in the name of the Department under the certificate of the Director of Revenue. Such reproduced copy shall, without further proof, be admitted into evidence before the Department or in any legal proceeding and shall be prima facie proof of the correctness of the amount of tax due, as shown therein. If the return so corrected by the Department discloses the sale or use, by a licensed manufacturer or importing distributor, of alcoholic liquors as to which the tax provided for in this Article should have been paid, but has not been paid, in excess of the alcoholic liquors reported as being taxable by the licensee, and as to which the proper tax was paid the Department shall notify the licensee that it shall issue the taxpayer a notice of tax liability for the amount of tax claimed by the Department to be due, together with penalties at the rates prescribed by Sections 3-3, 3-5 and 3-6 of the Uniform Penalty and Interest Act, which amount of tax shall be equivalent to the amount of tax which, at the prescribed rate per gallon, should have been paid with respect to the alcoholic liquors disposed of in excess of those reported as being taxable. No earlier than 90 days after the due date of the return, the Department may compare filed returns, or any amendments thereto, against reports of sales of alcoholic liquor submitted to the Department by other manufacturers and distributors. If a return or amended return is corrected by the Department because the return or amended return failed to disclose the purchase of alcoholic liquor from manufacturers or distributors on which the tax provided for in this Article should have been paid, but has not been paid, the Department shall issue the taxpayer a notice of tax liability for the amount of tax claimed by the Department to be due, together with penalties at the rates prescribed by Sections 3-3, 3-5, and 3-6 of the Uniform Penalty and Interest Act. In a case where no return has been filed, the Department shall determine the amount of tax due according to its best judgment and information and shall issue the taxpayer a notice of tax liability for the amount of tax claimed by the Department to be due as herein provided together with penalties at the rates prescribed by Sections 3-3, 3-5 and 3-6 of the Uniform Penalty and Interest Act. If, in administering the provisions of this Act, a comparison of a licensee's return or returns with the books, records and physical inventories of such licensee discloses a deficiency which cannot be allocated by the Department to a particular month or months, the Department shall issue the taxpayer a notice of tax liability for the amount of tax claimed by the Department to be due for a given period, but without any obligation upon the Department to allocate such deficiency to any particular month or months, together with penalties at the rates prescribed by Sections 3-3, 3-5 and 3-6 of the Uniform Penalty and Interest Act, which amount of tax shall be equivalent to the amount of tax which, at the prescribed rate per gallon, should have been paid with respect to the alcoholic liquors disposed of in excess of those reported being taxable, with the tax thereon having been paid under which circumstances the aforesaid notice of tax liability shall be prima facie correct and shall be prima facie evidence of the correctness of the amount of tax due as shown therein; and proof of such correctness may be made in accordance with, and the admissibility of a reproduced copy of such notice of the Department's notice of tax liability shall be governed by, all the provisions of this Act applicable to corrected returns.
    If the licensee dies or becomes a person under legal disability at any time before the Department issues its notice of tax liability, such notice shall be issued to the administrator, executor or other legal representative, as such, of the deceased or licensee who is under legal disability.
    If such licensee or legal representative, within 60 days after such notice of tax liability, files a protest to such notice of tax liability and requests a hearing thereon, the Department shall give at least 7 days' notice to such licensee or legal representative, as the case may be, of the time and place fixed for such hearing and shall hold a hearing in conformity with the provisions of this Act, and pursuant thereto shall issue a final assessment to such licensee or legal representative for the amount found to be due as a result of such hearing.
    If a protest to the notice of tax liability and a request for a hearing thereon is not filed within 60 days after such notice of tax liability, such notice of tax liability shall become final without the necessity of a final assessment being issued and shall be deemed to be a final assessment.
    In case of failure to pay the tax, or any portion thereof, or any penalty provided for herein, when due, the Department may recover the amount of such tax, or portion thereof, or penalty in a civil action; or if the licensee dies or becomes a person under legal disability, by filing a claim therefor against his or her estate; provided that no such claim shall be filed against the estate of any deceased or of the licensee who is under legal disability for any tax or penalty or portion thereof except in the manner prescribed and within the time limited by the Probate Act of 1975, as amended.
    The collection of any such tax and penalty, or either, by any means provided for herein, shall not be a bar to any prosecution under this Act.
    In addition to any other penalty provided for in this Article, all provisions of the Uniform Penalty and Interest Act that are not inconsistent with this Act apply.

    Sec. 8-6. The Department, or any officer or employee designated in writing by the Director thereof, for the purpose of administering and enforcing the provisions of this Act, may hold investigations and hearings concerning any matters covered by this Act. In holding or conducting any hearing or investigation authorized under this Act, the Department or any officer or employee of the Department designated, in writing, by the Director thereof, may examine any books, papers, records or memoranda bearing upon the manufacture, importation, sale or use of alcoholic liquors by any licensee, and may require the attendance of such licensee or of any officer, agent or employee of such licensee, or of any person having knowledge of such facts, and may take testimony and require proof for its information. In the conduct of any investigation or hearing, neither the Department nor any officer or employee thereof shall be bound by the technical rules of evidence, and no informality in any proceeding, or in the manner of taking testimony, shall invalidate any assessment, order, decision, rule or regulation made or approved or confirmed by the Department. The Director of Revenue or any duly designated officer or employee of the Department shall have power to administer oaths to such persons; and the Department shall have the power to issue subpoenas and subpoenas duces tecum, and the Department, or any other party to a proceeding pending before the Department, may apply to the circuit court to compel the attendance and testimony of witnesses and the production of books, papers, records and memoranda, by an attachment for contempt as provided for such purposes in civil cases.
    The Department or any officer or employee thereof, or any party in an investigation or hearing before the Department, may cause the depositions of witnesses within the State to be taken in the manner prescribed by law for like depositions in civil actions in courts of this State, and to that end compel the attendance of witnesses and the production of books, papers, records and memoranda.
    The books, papers, records and memoranda of the Department, or parts thereof, may be proved in any hearing, investigation or judicial proceeding by a reproduced copy thereof under the certificate of the Director of Revenue.

    The Circuit Court of the county wherein any hearing is held by the Department shall have power to review all final administrative decisions of the Department in administering the provisions of this Act. If the administrative proceeding which is to be reviewed judicially is a claim for refund proceeding commenced in accordance with Section 8-3 of this Act and Section 2a of "An Act in relation to the payment and disposition of moneys received by officers and employees of the State of Illinois by virtue of their office or employment", approved June 9, 1911, as amended, the Circuit Court having jurisdiction of the proceeding for judicial review under this Section and under the Administrative Review Law, as amended, shall be the same court that entered the injunction which is provided for in Section 2a of "An Act in relation to the payment and disposition of moneys received by officers and employees of the State of Illinois by virtue of their office or employment", and which enables such claim proceeding to be processed and disposed of as a claim for refund proceeding rather than as a claim for credit proceeding.
    The provisions of the Administrative Review Law, and all amendments and modifications thereof, and the rules adopted pursuant thereto, shall apply to and govern all proceedings for the judicial review of final administrative decisions of the Department hereunder. The term "administrative decision" is defined as in Section 3-101 of the Code of Civil Procedure.
    Service of summons issued in such review proceeding upon the Director of Revenue or the Assistant Director of Revenue of the Department of Revenue shall be service upon the Department. The Department shall certify the record of its proceedings if the licensee shall pay to it the sum of 75¢ per page of testimony taken before the Department and 25¢ per page of all other matters contained in such record, except that these charges may be waived where the Department is satisfied that the aggrieved party is a poor person who cannot afford to pay such charges. Provided, however, before the delivery of such record to the person applying for same, the payment therefor shall be made as hereinabove provided, and in the event of nonpayment for the record as hereinabove provided within 30 days after notice that such record is available, the complaint may be dismissed by the court upon motion of the Department.
    No stay order shall be entered by the Circuit Court unless the plaintiff in the review proceedings shall file with the court a bond in an amount fixed and approved by the court to indemnify the State against all loss and injury which may be sustained by it on account of the review proceedings and to secure all costs which may be occasioned by such proceedings.
    Whenever notice is required by this Act, such notice may be given by United States registered or certified mail with return receipt requested, addressed to the person concerned at his or her last known address, and proof of such mailing shall be sufficient for the purposes of this Act.
    Whenever any proceeding provided by this Act is commenced before the Department, either by the Department or by a person subject to this Act, and such person thereafter dies or becomes a person under legal disability before such proceeding is concluded, the legal representative of the deceased or the guardian of the person under legal disability shall notify the Department of such death or legal disability. The legal representative, as such, shall then be substituted by the Department for such person. If the legal representative fails to notify the Department of his or her appointment as such legal representative, the Department may, upon its own motion, substitute such legal representative in the proceeding pending before the Department for the person who died or became a person under legal disability.

    Sec. 8-10. It is the duty of each manufacturer, importing distributor and foreign importer to keep, at his licensed address or place of business, complete and accurate records of all sales or other dispositions of alcoholic liquor, and complete and accurate records of all alcoholic liquor produced, manufactured, compounded or imported, whether for himself or for another, together with a physical inventory made as of the close of each period for which a return is required, covering all alcoholic liquors on hand.

The central business location shall be located at a licensed importing distributor's premises. The Department of Revenue may in its discretion prescribe reasonable and uniform methods for keeping such records by manufacturers and importing distributors and foreign importers.
    In case of failure by manufacturers and importing distributors to keep such records or to make them available to the Department on demand, the Department shall determine the amount of tax due according to its best judgment and information, which amount so determined by the Department shall be prima facie correct, and the Department's notice of tax liability shall be given, and protest thereto and demand for a hearing may be made and final assessments arrived at, in accordance with the provisions of Section 8-5 hereof.

    (235 ILCS 5/9-2) (from Ch. 43, par. 167)
    Sec. 9-2. When any legal voters of a precinct in any city, village or incorporated town of more than 200,000 inhabitants, as determined by the last preceding Federal census, desire to pass upon the question of whether the sale at retail of alcoholic liquor shall be prohibited in the precinct or at a particular street address within the precinct, they shall, at least 104 days before an election, file in the office of the clerk of such city, village or incorporated town, a petition directed to the clerk, containing the signatures of not less than 25% of the legal voters registered with the board of election commissioners or county clerk, as the case may be, from the precinct. Provided, however, that when the petition seeks to prohibit the sale at retail of alcoholic liquor at a particular street address of a licensed establishment within the precinct the petition shall contain the signatures of not less than 40% of the legal voters requested from that precinct. The petition shall request that the proposition "Shall the sale at retail of alcoholic liquor be prohibited in (or at) ....?" be submitted to the voters of the precinct at the next ensuing election at which such proposition may be voted upon. The submission of the question to the voters of such precinct at such election shall be mandatory when the petition has been filed in proper form with the clerk. If more than one set of petitions are presented to the clerk for submission at the same election, the petition presented first shall be given preference; however, the clerk shall provisionally accept any other set of petitions setting forth the same (or substantially the same) proposition. If the first set of petitions for a proposition is found to be in proper form and is not found to be invalid, it shall be accepted by the clerk and all provisionally accepted sets of petitions setting forth the same (or substantially the same) proposition shall be rejected by the clerk. If the first set of petitions for a proposition is found not to be in proper form or is found to be invalid, the clerk shall (i) reject the first set of petitions, (ii) accept the first provisionally accepted set of petitions that is in proper form and is not found to be invalid, and (iii) reject all other provisionally accepted sets of petitions setting forth the same (or substantially the same) proposition. Notice of the filing of the petition and the result of the election shall be given to the Secretary of State at his offices in both, Chicago and Springfield, Illinois. A return of the result of the election shall be made to the clerk of the city, village or incorporated town in which the precinct is located. If a majority of the voters voting upon such proposition vote "YES", the sale at retail of alcoholic liquor shall be prohibited in the precinct or at the street address. If the sale at retail of alcoholic liquor at a particular street address is prohibited pursuant to this Section, the license for any establishment at that street address shall be void, and no person may apply for a license for the sale at retail of alcoholic liquor at an establishment at that street address unless such prohibition is discontinued pursuant to Section 9-10.
    In cities, villages and incorporated towns of 200,000 or less population, as determined by the last preceding Federal census, the vote upon the question of prohibiting the sale at retail of alcoholic liquor, or alcoholic liquor other than beer containing not more than 4% of alcohol by volume, or alcoholic liquor containing more than 4% of alcohol by weight in the original package and not for consumption on the premises, shall be by the voters of the political subdivision as a unit. When any legal voters of such a city, village or incorporated town desire to pass upon the question of whether the sale at retail of alcoholic liquor shall be prohibited in the municipality, they shall, at least 104 days before an election, file in the office of the clerk of the municipality, a petition directed to the clerk, containing the signatures of not less than 25% of the legal voters registered with the board of election commissioners or county clerk, as the case may be, from the municipality. The petition shall request that the proposition, "Shall the sale at retail of alcoholic liquor be prohibited in....?" be submitted to the voters of the municipality at the next ensuing election at which the proposition may be voted upon. The submission of the question to the voters of the municipality at such election shall be mandatory when the petition has been filed in proper form with the clerk. If more than one set of petitions are presented to the clerk for submission at the same election, setting forth the same or different propositions, the petition presented first shall be given preference and the clerk shall refuse to accept any other set of petitions. Notice of the filing of the petition and the result of the election shall be given to the Secretary of State at his offices in both Chicago and Springfield, Illinois. A return of the result of the election shall be made to the clerk of the city, village or incorporated town. If a majority of the voters voting upon the proposition vote "Yes", the sale at retail of alcoholic liquor shall be prohibited in the municipality.
    In the event a municipality does not vote to prohibit the sale at retail of alcoholic liquor, the council or governing body shall ascertain and determine what portions of the municipality are predominantly residence districts. No license permitting the sale of alcoholic liquors shall be issued by the local liquor commissioner or licensing officer permitting the sale of alcoholic liquors at any place within the residence district so determined, unless the owner or owners of at least two-thirds of the frontage, 200 feet in each direction along the street and streets adjacent to the place of business for which a license is sought, file with the local liquor commissioner or licensing officer, his or their written consent to the use of such place for the sale of alcoholic liquors.
    In each township or road district lying outside the corporate limits of a city, village or incorporated town, or in a part of a township or road district lying partly within and partly outside a city, village or incorporated town, the vote of such township, road district or part thereof, shall be as a unit. When any legal voters of any such township, or part thereof, in counties under township organization, or any legal voters of such road district or part thereof, in counties not under township organization, desire to vote upon the proposition as to whether the sale at retail of alcoholic liquor shall be prohibited in such township or road district or part thereof, they shall, at least 90 days before an election, file in the office of the township or road district clerk, of the township or road district within which the election is to be held, a petition directed to the clerk and containing the signatures of not less than 25% of the legal voters registered with the county clerk from such township or road district or part thereof. The submission of the question to the voters of the township, road district or part thereof, at the next ensuing election shall be mandatory when the petition has been filed in proper form with the clerk. If more than one set of petitions are presented to the clerk for submission at the same election, setting forth the same or different propositions, the petition presented first shall be given preference and the clerk shall refuse to accept any other set of petitions. A return of the result of such election shall be made to the clerk of the township or road district in which the territory is situated, and shall also be made to the Secretary of State at his offices in both Chicago and Springfield, Illinois.

In the event the boundaries of such political subdivision or precinct have been altered or the numbers of any precincts have been changed subsequent to the original election making the territory prohibited territory and prior to the filing of such petition for resubmission of the question, only those voters actually residing in the prohibited territory shall be eligible as signers of such resubmission petition, except that this limitation shall not apply in the case of a resubmission petition signed by at least 25% of the legal voters of a municipality in which the prohibited territory is located.
