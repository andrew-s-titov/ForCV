    Sec. 1A-4. Powers and duties of the Board.
    A. (Blank).
    B. The Board shall determine the qualifications of and appoint a chief education officer, to be known as the State Superintendent of Education, who may be proposed by the Governor and who shall serve at the pleasure of the Board and pursuant to a performance-based contract linked to statewide student performance and academic improvement within Illinois schools. Upon expiration or buyout of the contract of the State Superintendent of Education in office on the effective date of this amendatory Act of the 93rd General Assembly, a State Superintendent of Education shall be appointed by a State Board of Education that includes the 7 new Board members who were appointed to fill seats of members whose terms were terminated on the effective date of this amendatory Act of the 93rd General Assembly. Thereafter, a State Superintendent of Education must, at a minimum, be appointed at the beginning of each term of a Governor after that Governor has made appointments to the Board. A performance-based contract issued for the employment of a State Superintendent of Education entered into on or after the effective date of this amendatory Act of the 93rd General Assembly must expire no later than February 1, 2007, and subsequent contracts must expire no later than February 1 each 4 years thereafter. No contract shall be extended or renewed beyond February 1, 2007 and February 1 each 4 years thereafter, but a State Superintendent of Education shall serve until his or her successor is appointed. Each contract entered into on or before January 8, 2007 with a State Superintendent of Education must provide that the State Board of Education may terminate the contract for cause, and the State Board of Education shall not thereafter be liable for further payments under the contract. With regard to this amendatory Act of the 93rd General Assembly, it is the intent of the General Assembly that, beginning with the Governor who takes office on the second Monday of January, 2007, a State Superintendent of Education be appointed at the beginning of each term of a Governor after that Governor has made appointments to the Board. The State Superintendent of Education shall not serve as a member of the State Board of Education. The Board shall set the compensation of the State Superintendent of Education who shall serve as the Board's chief executive officer. The Board shall also establish the duties, powers and responsibilities of the State Superintendent, which shall be included in the State Superintendent's performance-based contract along with the goals and indicators of student performance and academic improvement used to measure the performance and effectiveness of the State Superintendent. The State Board of Education may delegate to the State Superintendent of Education the authority to act on the Board's behalf, provided such delegation is made pursuant to adopted board policy or the powers delegated are ministerial in nature. The State Board may not delegate authority under this Section to the State Superintendent to (1) nonrecognize school districts, (2) withhold State payments as a penalty, or (3) make final decisions under the contested case provisions of the Illinois Administrative Procedure Act unless otherwise provided by law.
    C. The powers and duties of the State Board of Education shall encompass all duties delegated to the Office of Superintendent of Public Instruction on January 12, 1975, except as the law providing for such powers and duties is thereafter amended, and such other powers and duties as the General Assembly shall designate. The Board shall be responsible for the educational policies and guidelines for public schools, pre-school through grade 12 and Vocational Education in the State of Illinois. The Board shall analyze the present and future aims, needs, and requirements of education in the State of Illinois and recommend to the General Assembly the powers which should be exercised by the Board. The Board shall recommend the passage and the legislation necessary to determine the appropriate relationship between the Board and local boards of education and the various State agencies and shall recommend desirable modifications in the laws which affect schools.
    D. Two members of the Board shall be appointed by the chairperson to serve on a standing joint Education Committee, 2 others shall be appointed from the Board of Higher Education, 2 others shall be appointed by the chairperson of the Illinois Community College Board, and 2 others shall be appointed by the chairperson of the Human Resource Investment Council. The Committee shall be responsible for making recommendations concerning the submission of any workforce development plan or workforce training program required by federal law or under any block grant authority. The Committee will be responsible for developing policy on matters of mutual concern to elementary, secondary and higher education such as Occupational and Career Education, Teacher Preparation and Certification, Educational Finance, Articulation between Elementary, Secondary and Higher Education and Research and Planning. The joint Education Committee shall meet at least quarterly and submit an annual report of its findings, conclusions, and recommendations to the State Board of Education, the Board of Higher Education, the Illinois Community College Board, the Human Resource Investment Council, the Governor, and the General Assembly. All meetings of this Committee shall be official meetings for reimbursement under this Act. On the effective date of this amendatory Act of the 95th General Assembly, the Joint Education Committee is abolished.
    E. Five members of the Board shall constitute a quorum. A majority vote of the members appointed, confirmed and serving on the Board is required to approve any action, except that the 7 new Board members who were appointed to fill seats of members whose terms were terminated on the effective date of this amendatory act of the 93rd General Assembly may vote to approve actions when appointed and serving.
    Using the most recently available data, the Board shall prepare and submit to the General Assembly and the Governor on or before January 14, 1976 and annually thereafter a report or reports of its findings and recommendations. Such annual report shall contain a separate section which provides a critique and analysis of the status of education in Illinois and which identifies its specific problems and recommends express solutions therefor. Such annual report also shall contain the following information for the preceding year ending on June 30: each act or omission of a school district of which the State Board of Education has knowledge as a consequence of scheduled, approved visits and which constituted a failure by the district to comply with applicable State or federal laws or regulations relating to public education, the name of such district, the date or dates on which the State Board of Education notified the school district of such act or omission, and what action, if any, the school district took with respect thereto after being notified thereof by the State Board of Education. The report shall also include the statewide high school dropout rate by grade level, sex and race and the annual student dropout rate of and the number of students who graduate from, transfer from or otherwise leave bilingual programs. The Auditor General shall annually perform a compliance audit of the State Board of Education's performance of the reporting duty imposed by this amendatory Act of 1986. A regular system of communication with other directly related State agencies shall be implemented.
    The requirement for reporting to the General Assembly shall be satisfied by filing copies of the report with the Speaker, the Minority Leader and the Clerk of the House of Representatives and the President, the Minority Leader and the Secretary of the Senate and the Legislative Council, as required by Section 3.1 of the General Assembly Organization Act, and filing such additional copies with the State Government Report Distribution Center for the General Assembly as is required under paragraph (t) of Section 7 of the State Library Act.
    F. Upon appointment of the 7 new Board members who were appointed to fill seats of members whose terms were terminated on the effective date of this amendatory Act of the 93rd General Assembly, the Board shall review all of its current rules in an effort to streamline procedures, improve efficiency, and eliminate unnecessary forms and paperwork.

    Sec. 1A-8. Powers of the Board in Assisting Districts Deemed in Financial Difficulties. To promote the financial integrity of school districts, the State Board of Education shall be provided the necessary powers to promote sound financial management and continue operation of the public schools.
    (a) The State Superintendent of Education may require a school district, including any district subject to Article 34A of this Code, to share financial information relevant to a proper investigation of the district's financial condition and the delivery of appropriate State financial, technical, and consulting services to the district if the district (i) has been designated, through the State Board of Education's School District Financial Profile System, as on financial warning or financial watch status, (ii) has failed to file an annual financial report, annual budget, deficit reduction plan, or other financial information as required by law, (iii) has been identified, through the district's annual audit or other financial and management information, as in serious financial difficulty in the current or next school year, or (iv) is determined to be likely to fail to fully meet any regularly scheduled, payroll-period obligations when due or any debt service payments when due or both. In addition to financial, technical, and consulting services provided by the State Board of Education, at the request of a school district, the State Superintendent may provide for an independent financial consultant to assist the district review its financial condition and options.
    (b) The State Board of Education, after proper investigation of a district's financial condition, may certify that a district, including any district subject to Article 34A, is in financial difficulty when any of the following conditions occur:
        (1) The district has issued school or teacher orders
    	
for wages as permitted in Sections 8-16, 32-7.2 and 34-76 of this Code.
        (2) The district has issued tax anticipation warrants
    	
or tax anticipation notes in anticipation of a second year's taxes when warrants or notes in anticipation of current year taxes are still outstanding, as authorized by Sections 17-16, 34-23, 34-59 and 34-63 of this Code, or has issued short-term debt against 2 future revenue sources, such as, but not limited to, tax anticipation warrants and general State aid or evidence-based funding certificates or tax anticipation warrants and revenue anticipation notes.
        (3) The district has for 2 consecutive years shown an
    	
excess of expenditures and other financing uses over revenues and other financing sources and beginning fund balances on its annual financial report for the aggregate totals of the Educational, Operations and Maintenance, Transportation, and Working Cash Funds.
        (4) The district refuses to provide financial
    	
information or cooperate with the State Superintendent in an investigation of the district's financial condition.
        (5) The district is likely to fail to fully meet any
    	
regularly scheduled, payroll-period obligations when due or any debt service payments when due or both.
    No school district shall be certified by the State Board of Education to be in financial difficulty solely by reason of any of the above circumstances arising as a result of (i) the failure of the county to make any distribution of property tax money due the district at the time such distribution is due or (ii) the failure of this State to make timely payments of general State aid, evidence-based funding, or any of the mandated categoricals; or if the district clearly demonstrates to the satisfaction of the State Board of Education at the time of its determination that such condition no longer exists. If the State Board of Education certifies that a district in a city with 500,000 inhabitants or more is in financial difficulty, the State Board shall so notify the Governor and the Mayor of the city in which the district is located. The State Board of Education may require school districts certified in financial difficulty, except those districts subject to Article 34A, to develop, adopt and submit a financial plan within 45 days after certification of financial difficulty. The financial plan shall be developed according to guidelines presented to the district by the State Board of Education within 14 days of certification. Such guidelines shall address the specific nature of each district's financial difficulties. Any proposed budget of the district shall be consistent with the financial plan submitted to and approved by the State Board of Education.
    A district certified to be in financial difficulty, other than a district subject to Article 34A, shall report to the State Board of Education at such times and in such manner as the State Board may direct, concerning the district's compliance with each financial plan. The State Board may review the district's operations, obtain budgetary data and financial statements, require the district to produce reports, and have access to any other information in the possession of the district that it deems relevant. The State Board may issue recommendations or directives within its powers to the district to assist in compliance with the financial plan. The district shall produce such budgetary data, financial statements, reports and other information and comply with such directives. If the State Board of Education determines that a district has failed to comply with its financial plan, the State Board of Education may rescind approval of the plan and appoint a Financial Oversight Panel for the district as provided in Section 1B-4. This action shall be taken only after the district has been given notice and an opportunity to appear before the State Board of Education to discuss its failure to comply with its financial plan.
    No bonds, notes, teachers orders, tax anticipation warrants or other evidences of indebtedness shall be issued or sold by a school district or be legally binding upon or enforceable against a local board of education of a district certified to be in financial difficulty unless and until the financial plan required under this Section has been approved by the State Board of Education.
    Any financial profile compiled and distributed by the State Board of Education in Fiscal Year 2009 or any fiscal year thereafter shall incorporate such adjustments as may be needed in the profile scores to reflect the financial effects of the inability or refusal of the State of Illinois to make timely disbursements of any general State aid, evidence-based funding, or mandated categorical aid payments due school districts or to fully reimburse school districts for mandated categorical programs pursuant to reimbursement formulas provided in this School Code.

    Sec. 1B-2. Findings and purpose.
    (a) The General Assembly finds:
        (1) A fundamental goal of the people of the State, as
    	
expressed in Section 1 of Article X of the Illinois Constitution, is the educational development of all persons to the limits of their capacities. When a board of education faces financial difficulties, continued operation of the public school system is threatened.
        (2) A sound financial structure is essential to the
    	
continued operation of any school system. It is vital to commercial, educational and cultural interests that the public schools remain in operation. To achieve that goal, public school systems must have effective access to the private market to borrow short and long term funds.
        (3) To promote the financial integrity of boards of
    	
education of school districts with a population of less than 500,000, it is necessary to provide for emergency State financial assistance and the creation of financial oversight panels with the powers necessary to promote sound financial management to assure the continued availability of educational opportunities.
    (b) It is the purpose of this Article to provide financial oversight panels and emergency State financial assistance to school districts and establish a secure financial basis for their continued existence. The intention of the General Assembly, in enacting this legislation, is to establish procedures, provide powers and impose restrictions to assure the financial and educational integrity of the public schools while leaving principal responsibility for the educational policies of the public schools to the boards of education within the State, consistent with the requirements for satisfying the public policy and purpose herein set forth.

    Sec. 1B-4. Establishment of Emergency Financial Assistance and Financial Oversight Panel. When approved by the State Board under this Article there is established a body both corporate and politic to be known as the "(Name of School District) Financial Oversight Panel" which, in such name, shall exercise all authority vested in such Panels by this Article.
    Upon the affirmative vote of not less than a majority of its full membership, a local board of education of a school district that has been certified to be in financial difficulty under Section 1A-8 may petition the State Board of Education for emergency financial assistance and the establishment of a Financial Oversight Panel for the district as provided under this Article. In addition, the State Superintendent of Education may petition the State Board of Education for the establishment of a Financial Oversight Panel, with or without emergency financial assistance, for any district that has failed to comply with its financial plan and has had the plan rescinded by the State Board as provided in Section 1A-8. No petition for emergency financial assistance shall be approved by the State Board unless there is also established a Financial Oversight Panel.
    In determining whether to allow the petition the State Board shall consider the following factors among others that it deems relevant:
    (a) whether the petition is in the best educational interests of the pupils of the district;
    (b) whether the petition is in the near and long term best financial interests of the district;
    (c) whether the district has sufficient pupil enrollment and assessed valuation to provide and maintain recognized schools;
    (d) whether the petition is in the best interests of the other schools of the area and the educational welfare of all of the pupils therein; and
    (e) whether the board of education has complied with the requirements of Section 1A-8.
    The State Board may vote to either grant or deny the petition based upon the recommendation of the State Superintendent of Education and any other testimony or documentary evidence the State Board deems relevant. The decision of the State Board whether to grant or deny the petition shall be final.

    (105 ILCS 5/1B-5) (from Ch. 122, par. 1B-5)
    Sec. 1B-5. When a petition for emergency financial assistance for a school district is allowed by the State Board under Section 1B-4, the State Superintendent shall within 10 days thereafter appoint 3 members to serve at the State Superintendent's pleasure on a Financial Oversight Panel for the district. The State Superintendent shall designate one of the members of the Panel to serve as its Chairman. In the event of vacancy or resignation the State Superintendent shall appoint a successor within 10 days of receiving notice thereof.
    Members of the Panel shall be selected primarily on the basis of their experience and education in financial management, with consideration given to persons knowledgeable in education finance. A member of the Panel may not be a board member or employee of the district for which the Panel is constituted, nor may a member have a direct financial interest in that district.
    Panel members shall serve without compensation, but may be reimbursed for travel and other necessary expenses incurred in the performance of their official duties by the State Board. The amount reimbursed Panel members for their expenses shall be charged to the school district as part of any emergency financial assistance and incorporated as a part of the terms and conditions for repayment of such assistance or shall be deducted from the district's general State aid or evidence-based funding as provided in Section 1B-8.
    The first meeting of the Panel shall be held at the call of the Chairman. The Panel may elect such other officers as it deems appropriate. The Panel shall prescribe the times and places for its meetings and the manner in which regular and special meetings may be called, and shall comply with the Open Meetings Act.
    Two members of the Panel shall constitute a quorum, and the affirmative vote of 2 members shall be necessary for any decision or action to be taken by the Panel.
    The Panel and the State Superintendent shall cooperate with each other in the exercise of their respective powers. The Panel shall report not later than September 1 annually to the State Board and the State Superintendent with respect to its activities and the condition of the school district for the previous fiscal year.
    Any Financial Oversight Panel established under this Article shall remain in existence for not less than 3 years nor more than 10 years from the date the State Board grants the petition under Section 1B-4. If after 3 years the school district has repaid all of its obligations resulting from emergency State financial assistance provided under this Article and has improved its financial situation, the board of education may, not more frequently than once in any 12 month period, petition the State Board to dissolve the Financial Oversight Panel, terminate the oversight responsibility, and remove the district's certification under Section 1A-8 as a district in financial difficulty. In acting on such a petition the State Board shall give additional weight to the recommendations of the State Superintendent and the Financial Oversight Panel.

    (105 ILCS 5/1B-8) (from Ch. 122, par. 1B-8)
    Sec. 1B-8. There is created in the State Treasury a special fund to be known as the School District Emergency Financial Assistance Fund (the "Fund"). The School District Emergency Financial Assistance Fund shall consist of appropriations, loan repayments, grants from the federal government, and donations from any public or private source. Moneys in the Fund may be appropriated only to the Illinois Finance Authority and the State Board for those purposes authorized under this Article and Articles 1F and 1H of this Code. The appropriation may be allocated and expended by the State Board for contractual services to provide technical assistance or consultation to school districts to assess their financial condition and to Financial Oversight Panels that petition for emergency financial assistance grants. The Illinois Finance Authority may provide loans to school districts which are the subject of an approved petition for emergency financial assistance under Section 1B-4, 1F-62, or 1H-65 of this Code. Neither the State Board of Education nor the Illinois Finance Authority may collect any fees for providing these services.
    From the amount allocated to each such school district under this Article the State Board shall identify a sum sufficient to cover all approved costs of the Financial Oversight Panel established for the respective school district. If the State Board and State Superintendent of Education have not approved emergency financial assistance in conjunction with the appointment of a Financial Oversight Panel, the Panel's approved costs shall be paid from deductions from the district's general State aid or evidence-based funding.
    The Financial Oversight Panel may prepare and file with the State Superintendent a proposal for emergency financial assistance for the school district and for its operations budget. No expenditures from the Fund shall be authorized by the State Superintendent until he or she has approved the request of the Panel, either as submitted or in such lesser amount determined by the State Superintendent.
    The maximum amount of an emergency financial assistance loan which may be allocated to any school district under this Article, including moneys necessary for the operations of the Panel, shall not exceed $4,000 times the number of pupils enrolled in the school district during the school year ending June 30 prior to the date of approval by the State Board of the petition for emergency financial assistance, as certified to the local board and the Panel by the State Superintendent. An emergency financial assistance grant shall not exceed $1,000 times the number of such pupils. A district may receive both a loan and a grant.
    The payment of an emergency State financial assistance grant or loan shall be subject to appropriation by the General Assembly. Payment of the emergency State financial assistance loan is subject to the applicable provisions of the Illinois Finance Authority Act. Emergency State financial assistance allocated and paid to a school district under this Article may be applied to any fund or funds from which the local board of education of that district is authorized to make expenditures by law.
    Any emergency financial assistance grant proposed by the Financial Oversight Panel and approved by the State Superintendent may be paid in its entirety during the initial year of the Panel's existence or spread in equal or declining amounts over a period of years not to exceed the period of the Panel's existence. An emergency financial assistance loan proposed by the Financial Oversight Panel and approved by the Illinois Finance Authority may be paid in its entirety during the initial year of the Panel's existence or spread in equal or declining amounts over a period of years not to exceed the period of the Panel's existence. All loans made by the Illinois Finance Authority for a school district shall be required to be repaid, with simple interest over the term of the loan at a rate equal to 50% of the one-year Constant Maturity Treasury (CMT) yield as last published by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System before the date on which the district's loan is approved by the Illinois Finance Authority, not later than the date the Financial Oversight Panel ceases to exist. The Panel shall establish and the Illinois Finance Authority shall approve the terms and conditions, including the schedule, of repayments. The schedule shall provide for repayments commencing July 1 of each year or upon each fiscal year's receipt of moneys from a tax levy for emergency financial assistance. Repayment shall be incorporated into the annual budget of the school district and may be made from any fund or funds of the district in which there are moneys available. An emergency financial assistance loan to the Panel or district shall not be considered part of the calculation of a district's debt for purposes of the limitation specified in Section 19-1 of this Code. Default on repayment is subject to the Illinois Grant Funds Recovery Act. When moneys are repaid as provided herein they shall not be made available to the local board for further use as emergency financial assistance under this Article at any time thereafter. All repayments required to be made by a school district shall be received by the State Board and deposited in the School District Emergency Financial Assistance Fund.
    In establishing the terms and conditions for the repayment obligation of the school district the Panel shall annually determine whether a separate local property tax levy is required. The board of any school district with a tax rate for educational purposes for the prior year of less than 120% of the maximum rate for educational purposes authorized by Section 17-2 shall provide for a separate tax levy for emergency financial assistance repayment purposes. Such tax levy shall not be subject to referendum approval. The amount of the levy shall be equal to the amount necessary to meet the annual repayment obligations of the district as established by the Panel, or 20% of the amount levied for educational purposes for the prior year, whichever is less. However, no district shall be required to levy the tax if the district's operating tax rate as determined under Section 18-8, 18-8.05, or 18-8.15 exceeds 200% of the district's tax rate for educational purposes for the prior year.

The financial plan submitted by the board shall be based upon revenue estimates approved or prepared by the Panel. As soon as practicable following the establishment of the Panel, the president of the board shall, at the request of the Chairman of the Panel, make available to the Panel copies of the audited financial statements and of the books and records of account of the board for the preceding 5 fiscal years of the board.
    (b) Each financial plan for each fiscal year or part thereof to which it relates, shall contain (1) a description of revenues and expenditures, provision for debt service, cash resources and uses, capital improvements, and a building utilization component requiring maximum efficient use of all classrooms and buildings, in such manner and detail as the Panel shall prescribe, (2) a description of the means by which the budget will be brought into balance, and (3) such other matters that the Panel, in its discretion, requires. For Panels established under Section 1B-4 for a district that had its financial plan rescinded by the State Board for violating that plan as provided in Section 1A-8, the financial plan required under this Section shall also include the staffing plan required pursuant to subsection (e) of Section 1B-22, provisions for addressing findings or violations identified by the Inspector General or the school district audit, provisions for implementing directives of the Panel, and the plan of action to be followed by the district to maintain long-term financial stability, provide for transition of the Panel's authority, and analyze the need for additional State funding for the district. The initial financial plan shall also include a description of the means by which any outstanding short-term indebtedness shall be paid or refunded by the board. The Panel may prescribe any reasonable time, standards, procedures or forms for preparation and submission of the financial plan.

Otherwise, the Panel shall reject the financial plan. In the event of rejection, the Panel may prescribe a procedure and standards for revision of the financial plan by the board.
    (d) The board shall report to the Panel, at such times and in such manner as the Panel may direct, concerning the board's compliance with each financial plan. The Panel may review the board's operations, obtain budgetary data and financial statements, require the board to produce reports, and have access to any other information in the possession of the board that it deems relevant.

The board shall produce such budgetary data, financial statements, reports and other information and comply with such directives.

The board shall promptly notify the Panel of any material change in the revenue or expenditure estimates in the financial plan. The board may submit to the Panel, or the Panel may require the board to submit, modified financial plans based upon revised revenue or expenditure estimates or for any other good reason. The Panel shall approve or reject each modified financial plan.

    Sec. 1B-18. Limitations of actions after abolition; indemnification. (a) Termination of the Financial Oversight Panel shall bar any remedy available against the Panel, its members, employees, or agents, for any right or claim existing, or any liability incurred, prior to such abolition unless the action or other proceeding thereon is commenced prior to the expiration of 2 years after the date of such termination.
    (b) The Panel may indemnify any member, officer, employee, or agent who was or is a party, or is threatened to be made a party, to any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, by reason of the fact that he was a member, officer, employee or agent of the Panel, against expenses (including attorneys' fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by him in connection with such action, suit or proceeding, if he acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in, or not opposed to, the best interests of the Panel and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe his conduct was unlawful. The termination of any action, suit or proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction, or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent, shall not, of itself, create a presumption that the person did not act in good faith in a manner which he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Panel, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had reasonable cause to believe that his conduct was unlawful.
    To the extent that a member, officer, employee or agent of the Panel has been successful, on the merits or otherwise, in the defense of any such action, suit or proceeding referred to in this subsection or in defense of any claim, issue or matter therein, he shall be indemnified against expenses (including attorneys' fees) actually and reasonably incurred by him in connection therewith. Any such indemnification shall be made by the Panel only as authorized in the specific case, upon a determination that indemnification of the member, officer, employee or agent is proper in the circumstances because he has met the applicable standard of conduct. The determination shall be made by the Panel by a majority vote of a quorum consisting of members who are not parties to such action, suit or proceeding, or if such a quorum is not obtainable, or, even if obtainable, a quorum of disinterested members so directs, by independent legal counsel in a written opinion.
    Reasonable expenses incurred in defending an action, suit or proceeding shall be paid by the Panel in advance of the final disposition of such action, suit or proceeding, as authorized by the Panel in the specific case, upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of the member, officer, employee or agent to repay such amount, unless it shall ultimately be determined that he is entitled to be indemnified by the Panel as authorized in this Section.
    Any member, officer, employee or agent against whom any action, suit or proceeding is brought may employ his or her own attorney to appear on his or her behalf.
    The right to indemnification accorded by this Section shall not limit any other right to indemnification to which the member, officer, employee or agent may be entitled. Any rights hereunder shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors and administrators of any member, officer, employee or agent of the Panel.
    The Panel may purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any person who is or was a member, officer, employee or agent of the Panel against any liability asserted against him and incurred by him in any such capacity, or arising out of his status as such, whether or not the Panel would have the power to indemnify him against such liability under the provisions of this Section.

    Sec. 1B-22. Additional Powers of the Panel. For Panels established under Section 1B-4 for a district which had its financial plan rescinded by the State Board for violating that plan as provided in Section 1A-8, the Panel shall have the following additional powers:
    (a) As necessary to carry out its purposes when district resources are not readily available or appropriate for use by the Panel, the Panel may make and execute contracts, leases, subleases and all other instruments or agreements necessary or convenient for the exercise of the powers and functions granted by this Article.
    (b) As necessary to carry out its purposes when district resources are not readily available or appropriate for use by the Panel, the Panel may purchase personal property necessary or convenient for its purposes; mortgage, pledge or otherwise grant security interests in such properties; and convey to the district such of its property as, in the judgment of the Panel, is no longer necessary for its purposes.
    (c) As necessary to carry out its purposes when district resources are not readily available or appropriate for use by the Panel, the Panel may appoint officers, agents, and employees of the Panel, define their duties and qualifications, and fix their compensation and employee benefits.
    (d) In order to investigate allegations of or incidents of waste, fraud, or financial mismanagement which the Board is unable or unwilling to properly investigate as requested by the Panel, the Panel may appoint an Inspector General who shall have the authority to conduct investigations into such allegations or incidents. The Inspector General shall make recommendations to the Panel about its investigations. The Inspector General shall be independent of the operations of the Panel and the Board and perform other duties requested by the Panel. The Inspector General shall have access to all information and personnel necessary to perform the duties of the office. If the Inspector General determines that a possible criminal act has been committed or that special expertise is required in the investigation, he shall immediately notify the State's Attorney in the county in which the district is located. All investigations conducted by the Inspector General shall be conducted in a manner that ensures the preservation of evidence for use in criminal prosecutions. At all times the Inspector General shall be granted access to any building or facility that is owned, operated, or leased by the Panel or the Board. The Inspector General shall have the power to subpoena witnesses and compel the production of books and papers pertinent to an investigation authorized by this Code. Any person who (1) fails to appear in response to a subpoena; (2) fails to answer any question; (3) fails to produce any books or papers pertinent to an investigation under this Code; or (4) knowingly gives false testimony during an investigation under this Code is guilty of a Class A misdemeanor. The Inspector General shall provide to the Panel and the State Board of Education a summary of reports and investigations made under this Section for the previous fiscal year no later than January 1 of each year. The summaries shall detail the final disposition of those recommendations. The summaries shall not contain any confidential or identifying information concerning the subjects of the reports and investigations. The summaries shall also include detailed recommended administrative actions and matters for consideration by the State Board of Education or the General Assembly.
    (e) No hiring or appointment of any person in any position by the Board, the superintendent, or any other officer or employee of the Board shall be made or entered into unless it is consistent with the Financial Plan and Budget in effect and the staffing plan approved by the Panel under this Section. The hiring or appointment of any person shall not be binding on the Board unless and until it is in compliance with this Section. The Board shall submit to the Panel for approval by the Panel a staffing plan for the upcoming school year at the same time as the submission of the Budget, except that the staffing plan for the fiscal year ending in 1997 shall be submitted to the Panel within 90 days after the effective date of this amendatory Act of 1996. The staffing plan shall be accompanied by a cost analysis and such other information as the Panel may require. The Panel may prescribe standards, procedures, and forms for submission of the staffing plan. The Panel shall approve the staffing plan if the information required to be submitted is complete and the staffing plan is consistent with the Budget and Financial Plan in effect. Otherwise, the Panel shall reject the staffing plan. In the event of rejection, the Panel shall prescribe a procedure and standards for revision of the staffing plan. The Panel shall act on the staffing plan at the same time as the approval of the Budget, except that the staffing plan for the fiscal year ending in 1997 shall be acted upon within 60 days of the submission of the staffing plan by the Board. The Board shall report to the Panel, at such times and in such manner as the Panel may direct, concerning the Board's compliance with each staffing plan. The Panel may review the Board's operations, obtaining budgetary data and financial statements, may require the Board to produce reports, and shall have access to any other information in the possession of the Board that it deems relevant. The Panel may issue directives to the Board to assure compliance with the staffing plan, including the issuance of reduction in force notices, non-renewal of employment contracts, or any other notices or actions required by contract or law. The Board shall produce such budgetary data, financial statements, reports, and other information and shall comply with such directives. After approval of each staffing plan, the Board shall regularly reexamine the estimates on which it was based and revise them as necessary. The Board shall promptly notify the Panel of any material change in the estimates in the staffing plan. The Board may submit to the Panel, or the Panel may require the Board to submit, modifications to the staffing plan based upon revised revenue or expenditure estimates or for any other good reason. The Panel shall approve or reject each modified staffing plan within 60 days of its submission in a manner similar to the provisions of this subsection for the approval or rejection of the initial staffing plan.
    (f) The Panel shall examine the business records and audit the accounts of the Board or require that the Board examine its business records and audit its accounts at such time and in such manner as the Panel may prescribe. The Board shall appoint a certified public accountant annually, approved by the Panel, to audit its financial statements. The audit conducted pursuant to this paragraph shall be in lieu of the audit that the Board is required to undertake pursuant to Section 3-7.
    (g) The Panel shall initiate and direct financial management assessments and similar analyses of the operations of the Board as may, in the judgment of the Panel, assure sound and efficient financial management of the Board. Upon the completion of these assessments, the Panel shall give directives to the Board regarding improvements and changes that derive from these assessments, which the Board shall implement. In conjunction with its budgetary submission to the Panel for each fiscal year, the Board shall demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Panel that the directives of the Panel have been implemented in whole or in part or, in the alternative, are not capable of being implemented. In consideration of whether to approve or reject the budget for a fiscal year, the Panel shall adjudge whether the Board has fully considered and responsibly proposed implementation of the Panel's directives.
    (h) The Panel shall initiate and direct a management audit of the Board at least once every 2 years. The audit shall review the personnel, organization, contracts, leases, and physical properties of the Board to determine whether the Board is managing and utilizing its resources in an economical and efficient manner. The audit shall determine the causes of any inefficiencies or uneconomical practices, including inadequacies in internal and administrative procedures, organizational structure, uses of resources, utilization of real property, allocation of personnel, purchasing policies, and equipment.
    (i) In the event that the Board refuses or fails to follow a directive of the Panel to issue notices of non-renewal of contracts, to issue notices of reduction in force to employees, to issue requests for bids or proposals, or to obtain financial or other information that the Panel finds necessary for the implementation of its responsibilities under this Article, the Panel may take such action in the name of the district, and such action shall be binding the same as if the action had been taken by the Board. The powers established by this paragraph do not authorize the Panel to enter into contracts in the name of the Board.
    (j) The Panel shall meet with the Board or its designees in closed session prior to the Board commencing any collective bargaining negotiations to discuss the financial issues relevant to the bargaining and for the purpose of the Panel approving the budget limitations for the potential collective bargaining agreement. The Board shall not make or consider any proposal which does not comply with the collective bargaining budget approved by the Panel. The Board shall keep the Panel apprised as to the status of the bargaining. The Board shall present any proposed change in the approved collective bargaining budget to the Panel in closed session for approval. Prior to the Board taking a final vote on any tentative agreement approved by the employee organization, the Board shall discuss the tentative agreement with the Panel in closed session. Upon final approval of a collective bargaining agreement by both the Board and the employee organization, the Board shall submit the final collective bargaining agreement to the Panel for approval. At the same time that the Board submits the final agreement to the Panel, the Board shall notify the employee organization that the final agreement has been submitted and the date of the Panel meeting at which the final agreement will be considered. The employee organization shall be provided an opportunity to discuss the final agreement with the Panel prior to the Panel taking action on the agreement. No collective bargaining agreement shall be binding upon the district unless the Board has followed the requirements of this paragraph and the final agreement has been approved by the Panel.
    (k) The budget of the Panel or any revisions to the budget, including any costs to the Panel associated with the appointment of an Inspector General, shall be approved by the State Superintendent upon request of the Panel and after opportunity for response by the Board.

The State Board of Education may adopt rules and regulations necessary to implement this Section. In accordance with Section 2-3.32, all state block grants are subject to an audit. Therefore, block grant receipts and block grant expenditures shall be recorded to the appropriate fund code.
    (b) (Blank).
    (c) An Early Childhood Education Block Grant shall be created by combining the following programs: Preschool Education, Parental Training and Prevention Initiative. These funds shall be distributed to school districts and other entities on a competitive basis, except that the State Board of Education shall award to a school district having a population exceeding 500,000 inhabitants 37% of the funds in each fiscal year. Not less than 14% of the Early Childhood Education Block Grant allocation of funds shall be used to fund programs for children ages 0-3. Beginning in Fiscal Year 2016, at least 25% of any additional Early Childhood Education Block Grant funding over and above the previous fiscal year's allocation shall be used to fund programs for children ages 0-3. Once the percentage of Early Childhood Education Block Grant funding allocated to programs for children ages 0-3 reaches 20% of the overall Early Childhood Education Block Grant allocation for a full fiscal year, thereafter in subsequent fiscal years the percentage of Early Childhood Education Block Grant funding allocated to programs for children ages 0-3 each fiscal year shall remain at least 20% of the overall Early Childhood Education Block Grant allocation. However, if, in a given fiscal year, the amount appropriated for the Early Childhood Education Block Grant is insufficient to increase the percentage of the grant to fund programs for children ages 0-3 without reducing the amount of the grant for existing providers of preschool education programs, then the percentage of the grant to fund programs for children ages 0-3 may be held steady instead of increased.

ARTICLE 1D. BLOCK GRANTS FOR DISTRICTS
WITH OVER 500,000 INHABITANTS

    (105 ILCS 5/1D-1)
    (Text of Section from P.A. 100-55)
    Sec. 1D-1. Block grant funding.
    (a) For fiscal year 1996 and each fiscal year thereafter, the State Board of Education shall award to a school district having a population exceeding 500,000 inhabitants a general education block grant and an educational services block grant, determined as provided in this Section, in lieu of distributing to the district separate State funding for the programs described in subsections (b) and (c). The provisions of this Section, however, do not apply to any federal funds that the district is entitled to receive. In accordance with Section 2-3.32, all block grants are subject to an audit. Therefore, block grant receipts and block grant expenditures shall be recorded to the appropriate fund code for the designated block grant.
    (b) The general education block grant shall include the following programs: REI Initiative, Summer Bridges, Preschool Education, K-6 Comprehensive Arts, School Improvement Support, Urban Education, Scientific Literacy, Substance Abuse Prevention, Second Language Planning, Staff Development, Outcomes and Assessment, K-6 Reading Improvement, 7-12 Continued Reading Improvement, Truants' Optional Education, Hispanic Programs, Agriculture Education, Parental Training, Prevention Initiative, Report Cards, and Criminal Background Investigations. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, all amounts paid under the general education block grant from State appropriations to a school district in a city having a population exceeding 500,000 inhabitants shall be appropriated and expended by the board of that district for any of the programs included in the block grant or any of the board's lawful purposes. Beginning in Fiscal Year 2018, at least 25% of any additional Preschool Education, Parental Training, and Prevention Initiative program funding over and above the previous fiscal year's allocation shall be used to fund programs for children ages 0-3. Beginning in Fiscal Year 2018, funding for Preschool Education, Parental Training, and Prevention Initiative programs above the allocation for these programs in Fiscal Year 2017 must be used solely as a supplement for these programs and may not supplant funds received from other sources.
    (c) The educational services block grant shall include the following programs: Regular and Vocational Transportation, State Lunch and Free Breakfast Program, Special Education (Personnel, Transportation, Orphanage, Private Tuition), funding for children requiring special education services, Summer School, Educational Service Centers, and Administrator's Academy. This subsection (c) does not relieve the district of its obligation to provide the services required under a program that is included within the educational services block grant. It is the intention of the General Assembly in enacting the provisions of this subsection (c) to relieve the district of the administrative burdens that impede efficiency and accompany single-program funding. The General Assembly encourages the board to pursue mandate waivers pursuant to Section 2-3.25g.
    The funding program included in the educational services block grant for funding for children requiring special education services in each fiscal year shall be treated in that fiscal year as a payment to the school district in respect of services provided or costs incurred in the prior fiscal year, calculated in each case as provided in this Section. Nothing in this Section shall change the nature of payments for any program that, apart from this Section, would be or, prior to adoption or amendment of this Section, was on the basis of a payment in a fiscal year in respect of services provided or costs incurred in the prior fiscal year, calculated in each case as provided in this Section.
    (d) For fiscal year 1996 and each fiscal year thereafter, the amount of the district's block grants shall be determined as follows: (i) with respect to each program that is included within each block grant, the district shall receive an amount equal to the same percentage of the current fiscal year appropriation made for that program as the percentage of the appropriation received by the district from the 1995 fiscal year appropriation made for that program, and (ii) the total amount that is due the district under the block grant shall be the aggregate of the amounts that the district is entitled to receive for the fiscal year with respect to each program that is included within the block grant that the State Board of Education shall award the district under this Section for that fiscal year. In the case of the Summer Bridges program, the amount of the district's block grant shall be equal to 44% of the amount of the current fiscal year appropriation made for that program.
    (e) The district is not required to file any application or other claim in order to receive the block grants to which it is entitled under this Section. The State Board of Education shall make payments to the district of amounts due under the district's block grants on a schedule determined by the State Board of Education.
    (f) A school district to which this Section applies shall report to the State Board of Education on its use of the block grants in such form and detail as the State Board of Education may specify. In addition, the report must include the following description for the district, which must also be reported to the General Assembly: block grant allocation and expenditures by program; population and service levels by program; and administrative expenditures by program. The State Board of Education shall ensure that the reporting requirements for the district are the same as for all other school districts in this State.
    (g) This paragraph provides for the treatment of block grants under Article 1C for purposes of calculating the amount of block grants for a district under this Section. Those block grants under Article 1C are, for this purpose, treated as included in the amount of appropriation for the various programs set forth in paragraph (b) above. The appropriation in each current fiscal year for each block grant under Article 1C shall be treated for these purposes as appropriations for the individual program included in that block grant. The proportion of each block grant so allocated to each such program included in it shall be the proportion which the appropriation for that program was of all appropriations for such purposes now in that block grant, in fiscal 1995.
    Payments to the school district under this Section with respect to each program for which payments to school districts generally, as of the date of this amendatory Act of the 92nd General Assembly, are on a reimbursement basis shall continue to be made to the district on a reimbursement basis, pursuant to the provisions of this Code governing those programs.
    (h) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, any school district receiving a block grant under this Section may classify all or a portion of the funds that it receives in a particular fiscal year from any block grant authorized under this Code or from general State aid pursuant to Section 18-8.05 of this Code (other than supplemental general State aid) as funds received in connection with any funding program for which it is entitled to receive funds from the State in that fiscal year (including, without limitation, any funding program referred to in subsection (c) of this Section), regardless of the source or timing of the receipt. The district may not classify more funds as funds received in connection with the funding program than the district is entitled to receive in that fiscal year for that program. Any classification by a district must be made by a resolution of its board of education. The resolution must identify the amount of any block grant or general State aid to be classified under this subsection (h) and must specify the funding program to which the funds are to be treated as received in connection therewith. This resolution is controlling as to the classification of funds referenced therein. A certified copy of the resolution must be sent to the State Superintendent of Education. The resolution shall still take effect even though a copy of the resolution has not been sent to the State Superintendent of Education in a timely manner. No classification under this subsection (h) by a district shall affect the total amount or timing of money the district is entitled to receive under this Code. No classification under this subsection (h) by a district shall in any way relieve the district from or affect any requirements that otherwise would apply with respect to the block grant as provided in this Section, including any accounting of funds by source, reporting expenditures by original source and purpose, reporting requirements, or requirements of provision of services.

    Sec. 1D-1. Block grant funding.
    (a) For fiscal year 1996 through fiscal year 2017, the State Board of Education shall award to a school district having a population exceeding 500,000 inhabitants a general education block grant and an educational services block grant, determined as provided in this Section, in lieu of distributing to the district separate State funding for the programs described in subsections (b) and (c). The provisions of this Section, however, do not apply to any federal funds that the district is entitled to receive. In accordance with Section 2-3.32, all block grants are subject to an audit. Therefore, block grant receipts and block grant expenditures shall be recorded to the appropriate fund code for the designated block grant.
    (b) The general education block grant shall include the following programs: REI Initiative, Summer Bridges, Preschool At Risk, K-6 Comprehensive Arts, School Improvement Support, Urban Education, Scientific Literacy, Substance Abuse Prevention, Second Language Planning, Staff Development, Outcomes and Assessment, K-6 Reading Improvement, 7-12 Continued Reading Improvement, Truants' Optional Education, Hispanic Programs, Agriculture Education, Parental Education, Prevention Initiative, Report Cards, and Criminal Background Investigations. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, all amounts paid under the general education block grant from State appropriations to a school district in a city having a population exceeding 500,000 inhabitants shall be appropriated and expended by the board of that district for any of the programs included in the block grant or any of the board's lawful purposes.
    (c) The educational services block grant shall include the following programs: Regular and Vocational Transportation, State Lunch and Free Breakfast Program, Special Education (Personnel, Transportation, Orphanage, Private Tuition), funding for children requiring special education services, Summer School, Educational Service Centers, and Administrator's Academy. This subsection (c) does not relieve the district of its obligation to provide the services required under a program that is included within the educational services block grant. It is the intention of the General Assembly in enacting the provisions of this subsection (c) to relieve the district of the administrative burdens that impede efficiency and accompany single-program funding. The General Assembly encourages the board to pursue mandate waivers pursuant to Section 2-3.25g.
    The funding program included in the educational services block grant for funding for children requiring special education services in each fiscal year shall be treated in that fiscal year as a payment to the school district in respect of services provided or costs incurred in the prior fiscal year, calculated in each case as provided in this Section. Nothing in this Section shall change the nature of payments for any program that, apart from this Section, would be or, prior to adoption or amendment of this Section, was on the basis of a payment in a fiscal year in respect of services provided or costs incurred in the prior fiscal year, calculated in each case as provided in this Section.
    (d) For fiscal year 1996 through fiscal year 2017, the amount of the district's block grants shall be determined as follows: (i) with respect to each program that is included within each block grant, the district shall receive an amount equal to the same percentage of the current fiscal year appropriation made for that program as the percentage of the appropriation received by the district from the 1995 fiscal year appropriation made for that program, and (ii) the total amount that is due the district under the block grant shall be the aggregate of the amounts that the district is entitled to receive for the fiscal year with respect to each program that is included within the block grant that the State Board of Education shall award the district under this Section for that fiscal year. In the case of the Summer Bridges program, the amount of the district's block grant shall be equal to 44% of the amount of the current fiscal year appropriation made for that program.
    (e) The district is not required to file any application or other claim in order to receive the block grants to which it is entitled under this Section. The State Board of Education shall make payments to the district of amounts due under the district's block grants on a schedule determined by the State Board of Education.
    (f) A school district to which this Section applies shall report to the State Board of Education on its use of the block grants in such form and detail as the State Board of Education may specify. In addition, the report must include the following description for the district, which must also be reported to the General Assembly: block grant allocation and expenditures by program; population and service levels by program; and administrative expenditures by program. The State Board of Education shall ensure that the reporting requirements for the district are the same as for all other school districts in this State.
    (g) Through fiscal year 2017, this paragraph provides for the treatment of block grants under Article 1C for purposes of calculating the amount of block grants for a district under this Section. Those block grants under Article 1C are, for this purpose, treated as included in the amount of appropriation for the various programs set forth in paragraph (b) above. The appropriation in each current fiscal year for each block grant under Article 1C shall be treated for these purposes as appropriations for the individual program included in that block grant. The proportion of each block grant so allocated to each such program included in it shall be the proportion which the appropriation for that program was of all appropriations for such purposes now in that block grant, in fiscal 1995.
    Payments to the school district under this Section with respect to each program for which payments to school districts generally, as of the date of this amendatory Act of the 92nd General Assembly, are on a reimbursement basis shall continue to be made to the district on a reimbursement basis, pursuant to the provisions of this Code governing those programs.
    (h) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, any school district receiving a block grant under this Section may classify all or a portion of the funds that it receives in a particular fiscal year from any block grant authorized under this Code or from general State aid pursuant to Section 18-8.05 of this Code (other than supplemental general State aid) as funds received in connection with any funding program for which it is entitled to receive funds from the State in that fiscal year (including, without limitation, any funding program referred to in subsection (c) of this Section), regardless of the source or timing of the receipt. The district may not classify more funds as funds received in connection with the funding program than the district is entitled to receive in that fiscal year for that program. Any classification by a district must be made by a resolution of its board of education. The resolution must identify the amount of any block grant or general State aid to be classified under this subsection (h) and must specify the funding program to which the funds are to be treated as received in connection therewith. This resolution is controlling as to the classification of funds referenced therein. A certified copy of the resolution must be sent to the State Superintendent of Education.

    Sec. 1E-5. Findings; purpose; intent.
    (a) The General Assembly finds all of the following:
        (1) A fundamental goal of the people of this State,
    	
as expressed in Section 1 of Article X of the Illinois Constitution, is the educational development of all persons to the limits of their capacities. When a board of education faces financial difficulties, continued operation of the public school system is threatened.
        (2) A sound financial structure is essential to the
    	
continued operation of any school system. It is vital to commercial, educational, and cultural interests that public schools remain in operation. To achieve that goal, public school systems must have effective access to the private market to borrow short and long term funds.
        (3) To promote the financial integrity of districts,
    	
as defined in this Article, it is necessary to provide for the creation of school finance authorities with the powers necessary to promote sound financial management and to ensure the continued operation of the public schools.
    (b) It is the purpose of this Article to provide a secure financial basis for the continued operation of public schools. The intention of the General Assembly, in creating this Article, is to establish procedures, provide powers, and impose restrictions to ensure the financial and educational integrity of the public schools, while leaving principal responsibility for the educational policies of public schools to the boards of education within the State, consistent with the requirements for satisfying the public policy and purpose set forth in this Article.

    Sec. 1E-70. Terms of bonds.
    (a) Whenever the Authority desires or is required to issue Bonds as provided in this Article, it shall adopt a resolution designating the amount of the Bonds to be issued, the purposes for which the proceeds of the Bonds are to be used, and the manner in which the proceeds shall be held pending the application thereof. The Bonds shall be issued in the corporate name of the Authority and shall bear such date or dates and shall mature at such time or times, not exceeding 20 years from their date, as the resolution may provide. The Bonds may be issued as serial bonds payable in installments, as term bonds with sinking fund installments, or as a combination of these as the Authority may determine in the resolution. The Bonds shall be in such denominations as the Authority may determine. The Bonds shall be in such form, carry such registration privileges, be executed in such manner, be payable at such place or places, and be subject to such terms of redemption at such redemption prices, including premium, as the resolution may provide. The Bonds shall be sold by the Authority at public or private sale, as determined by the Authority.
    (b) In connection with the issuance of its Bonds, the Authority may enter into arrangements to provide additional security and liquidity for the Bonds. These may include without limitation municipal bond insurance, letters of credit, lines of credit by which the Authority may borrow funds to pay or redeem its Bonds, and purchase or remarketing arrangements for ensuring the ability of owners of the Authority's Bonds to sell their Bonds or to have their Bonds redeemed. The Authority may enter into contracts and may agree to pay fees to persons providing the arrangements, including from Bond proceeds, but only under circumstances in which the total interest paid or to be paid on the Bonds, together with the fees for the arrangements (being treated as if interest), would not, taken together, cause the Bonds to bear interest, calculated to their absolute maturity, at a rate in excess of the maximum rate allowed by law.
    The resolution of the Authority authorizing the issuance of its Bonds may provide that interest rates may vary from time to time depending upon criteria established by the Authority, which may include without limitation a variation in interest rates as may be necessary to cause the Bonds to be remarketable from time to time at a price equal to their principal amount, and may provide for appointment of a national banking association, bank, trust company, investment banker, or other financial institution to serve as a remarketing agent in that connection. The resolution of the Authority authorizing the issuance of its Bonds may provide that alternative interest rates or provisions shall apply during such times as the Bonds are held by a person providing a letter of credit or other credit enhancement arrangement for those Bonds.

    (b) The levy shall be for the sole benefit of the holders of the Bonds, and the holders of the Bonds shall have a security interest in and lien upon all rights, claims, and interests of the Authority arising pursuant to the levy and all present and future proceeds of the levy until the principal of and sinking fund installments and interest on the Bonds are paid in full. All proceeds from the levy shall be deposited by each county collector directly in the debt service fund established pursuant to Section 1E-80 of this Code, shall be applied solely for the payment of principal of and sinking fund installments and interest on the Bonds, and shall not be used for any other purpose.

The tax shall be separate and apart from all other taxes of the Authority or the district and shall be separately identified by the collectors.

    (a) Abolition of the Authority pursuant to Section 1E-155 of this Code shall bar any remedy available against the Authority, its members, employees, or agents for any right or claim existing or any liability incurred prior to the abolition unless the action or other proceeding is commenced prior to the expiration of 2 years after the date of the abolition.
    (b) The Authority may indemnify any member, officer, employee, or agent who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending, or completed action, suit, or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative, or investigative, by reason of the fact that he or she was a member, officer, employee, or agent of the Authority, against expenses (including attorney's fees, judgments, fines, and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by him or her in connection with the action, suit, or proceeding) if he or she acted in good faith and in a manner that he or she reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Authority and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe his or her conduct was unlawful. The termination of any action, suit, or proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, or conviction or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent, shall not, of itself, create a presumption that the person did not act in good faith in a manner that he or she reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interest of the Authority and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had reasonable cause to believe that his or her conduct was unlawful.
    To the extent that a member, officer, employee, or agent of the Authority has been successful, on the merits or otherwise, in the defense of any such action, suit, or proceeding referred to in this subsection (b) or in defense of any claim, issue, or matter therein, he or she shall be indemnified against expenses, including attorney's fees, actually and reasonably incurred by him or her in connection therewith. Any such indemnification shall be made by the Authority only as authorized in the specific case, upon a determination that indemnification of the member, officer, employee, or agent is proper in the circumstances because he or she has met the applicable standard of conduct. The determination shall be made (i) by the Authority by a majority vote of a quorum consisting of members who are not parties to the action, suit, or proceeding or (ii) if such a quorum is not obtainable or, even if obtainable, a quorum of disinterested members so directs, by independent legal counsel in a written opinion.
    Reasonable expenses incurred in defending an action, suit, or proceeding shall be paid by the Authority in advance of the final disposition of the action, suit, or proceeding, as authorized by the Authority in the specific case, upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of the member, officer, employee, or agent to repay the amount, unless it is ultimately determined that he or she is entitled to be indemnified by the Authority as authorized in this Section.
    Any member, officer, employee, or agent against whom any action, suit, or proceeding is brought may employ his or her own attorney to appear on his or her behalf.
    The right to indemnification accorded by this Section shall not limit any other right to indemnification to which the member, officer, employee, or agent may be entitled. Any rights under this Section shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors, and administrators of any member, officer, employee, or agent of the Authority.
    The Authority may purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any person who is or was a member, officer, employee, or agent of the Authority against any liability asserted against him or her and incurred by him or her in any such capacity or arising out of his or her status as such, whether or not the Authority would have the power to indemnify him or her against the liability under the provisions of this Section.
    The Authority shall be considered a State agency for purposes of receiving representation by the Attorney General. Members, officers, employees, and agents of the Authority shall be entitled to representation and indemnification under the State Employee Indemnification Act.

        (1) A fundamental goal of the people of this State,
    	
as expressed in Section 1 of Article X of the Illinois Constitution, is the educational development of all persons to the limits of their capacities. When a board of education faces financial difficulties, continued operation of the public school system is threatened.
        (2) A sound financial structure is essential to the
    	
continued operation of any school system. It is vital to commercial, educational, and cultural interests that public schools remain in operation. To achieve that goal, public school systems must have effective access to the private market to borrow short and long term funds.
        (3) To promote the financial integrity of districts,
    	
as defined in this Article, it is necessary to provide for the creation of school finance authorities with the powers necessary to promote sound financial management and to ensure the continued operation of the public schools.
    (b) It is the purpose of this Article to provide a secure financial basis for the continued operation of public schools. The intention of the General Assembly, in creating this Article, is to establish procedures, provide powers, and impose restrictions to ensure the financial and educational integrity of the public schools, while leaving principal responsibility for the educational policies of public schools to the boards of education within the State, consistent with the requirements for satisfying the public policy and purpose set forth in this Article.

The status of all teachers in contractual continued service transferred to an annexing district shall not be lost, and the board of the annexing district is subject to this Code with respect to teachers in contractual continued service who are transferred in the same manner as if the person were the annexing district's employee and had been its employee during the time the person was actually employed by the board of the dissolving district from which the position was transferred.

(This Section scheduled to be repealed in accordance with 105 ILCS 5/1F-165)
    Sec. 1F-62. School District Emergency Financial Assistance Fund; grants and loans.
    (a) Moneys in the School District Emergency Financial Assistance Fund established under Section 1B-8 of this Code may be allocated and expended by the State Board as grants to provide technical and consulting services to school districts to assess their financial condition and by the Illinois Finance Authority for emergency financial assistance loans to a School Finance Authority that petitions for emergency financial assistance. An emergency financial assistance loan to a School Finance Authority or borrowing from sources other than the State shall not be considered as part of the calculation of a district's debt for purposes of the limitation specified in Section 19-1 of this Code. From the amount allocated to each School Finance Authority, the State Board shall identify a sum sufficient to cover all approved costs of the School Finance Authority. If the State Board and State Superintendent have not approved emergency financial assistance in conjunction with the appointment of a School Finance Authority, the Authority's approved costs shall be paid from deductions from the district's general State aid or evidence-based funding.
    The School Finance Authority may prepare and file with the State Superintendent a proposal for emergency financial assistance for the school district and for its operations budget. No expenditures shall be authorized by the State Superintendent until he or she has approved the proposal of the School Finance Authority, either as submitted or in such lesser amount determined by the State Superintendent.
    (b) The amount of an emergency financial assistance loan that may be allocated to a School Finance Authority under this Article, including moneys necessary for the operations of the School Finance Authority, and borrowing from sources other than the State shall not exceed, in the aggregate, $4,000 times the number of pupils enrolled in the district during the school year ending June 30 prior to the date of approval by the State Board of the petition for emergency financial assistance, as certified to the school board and the School Finance Authority by the State Superintendent. However, this limitation does not apply to borrowing by the district secured by amounts levied by the district prior to establishment of the School Finance Authority. An emergency financial assistance grant shall not exceed $1,000 times the number of such pupils. A district may receive both a loan and a grant.
    (c) The payment of a State emergency financial assistance grant or loan shall be subject to appropriation by the General Assembly. State emergency financial assistance allocated and paid to a School Finance Authority under this Article may be applied to any fund or funds from which the School Finance Authority is authorized to make expenditures by law.
    (d) Any State emergency financial assistance proposed by the School Finance Authority and approved by the State Superintendent may be paid in its entirety during the initial year of the School Finance Authority's existence or spread in equal or declining amounts over a period of years not to exceed the period of the School Finance Authority's existence. The State Superintendent shall not approve any loan to the School Finance Authority unless the School Finance Authority has been unable to borrow sufficient funds to operate the district.
    All loan payments made from the School District Emergency Financial Assistance Fund to a School Finance Authority shall be required to be repaid not later than the date the School Finance Authority ceases to exist, with simple interest over the term of the loan at a rate equal to 50% of the one-year Constant Maturity Treasury (CMT) yield as last published by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System before the date on which the School Finance Authority's loan is approved by the State Board.
    The School Finance Authority shall establish and the Illinois Finance Authority shall approve the terms and conditions of the loan, including the schedule of repayments. The schedule shall provide for repayments commencing July 1 of each year or upon each fiscal year's receipt of moneys from a tax levy for emergency financial assistance. Repayment shall be incorporated into the annual budget of the district and may be made from any fund or funds of the district in which there are moneys available. Default on repayment is subject to the Illinois Grant Funds Recovery Act. When moneys are repaid as provided in this Section, they shall not be made available to the School Finance Authority for further use as emergency financial assistance under this Article at any time thereafter. All repayments required to be made by a School Finance Authority shall be received by the State Board and deposited in the School District Emergency Financial Assistance Fund.
    In establishing the terms and conditions for the repayment obligation of the School Finance Authority, the School Finance Authority shall annually determine whether a separate local property tax levy is required to meet that obligation. The School Finance Authority shall provide for a separate tax levy for emergency financial assistance repayment purposes. This tax levy shall not be subject to referendum approval. The amount of the levy shall not exceed the amount necessary to meet the annual emergency financial repayment obligations of the district, including principal and interest, as established by the School Finance Authority.

    (a) Abolition of the Authority pursuant to Section 1F-155 of this Code shall bar any remedy available against the Authority, its members, employees, or agents for any right or claim existing or any liability incurred prior to the abolition unless the action or other proceeding is commenced prior to the expiration of 2 years after the date of the abolition.
    (b) The Authority may indemnify any member, officer, employee, or agent who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending, or completed action, suit, or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative, or investigative, by reason of the fact that he or she was a member, officer, employee, or agent of the Authority, against expenses (including attorney's fees, judgments, fines, and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by him or her in connection with the action, suit, or proceeding) if he or she acted in good faith and in a manner that he or she reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Authority and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe his or her conduct was unlawful. The termination of any action, suit, or proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, or conviction or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent, shall not, of itself, create a presumption that the person did not act in good faith in a manner that he or she reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interest of the Authority and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had reasonable cause to believe that his or her conduct was unlawful.
    To the extent that a member, officer, employee, or agent of the Authority has been successful, on the merits or otherwise, in the defense of any such action, suit, or proceeding referred to in this subsection (b) or in defense of any claim, issue, or matter therein, he or she shall be indemnified against expenses, including attorney's fees, actually and reasonably incurred by him or her in connection therewith. Any such indemnification shall be made by the Authority only as authorized in the specific case, upon a determination that indemnification of the member, officer, employee, or agent is proper in the circumstances because he or she has met the applicable standard of conduct. The determination shall be made (i) by the Authority by a majority vote of a quorum consisting of members who are not parties to the action, suit, or proceeding or (ii) if such a quorum is not obtainable or, even if obtainable, a quorum of disinterested members so directs, by independent legal counsel in a written opinion.
    Reasonable expenses incurred in defending an action, suit, or proceeding shall be paid by the Authority in advance of the final disposition of the action, suit, or proceeding, as authorized by the Authority in the specific case, upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of the member, officer, employee, or agent to repay the amount, unless it is ultimately determined that he or she is entitled to be indemnified by the Authority as authorized in this Section.
    Any member, officer, employee, or agent against whom any action, suit, or proceeding is brought may employ his or her own attorney to appear on his or her behalf.
    The right to indemnification accorded by this Section shall not limit any other right to indemnification to which the member, officer, employee, or agent may be entitled. Any rights under this Section shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors, and administrators of any member, officer, employee, or agent of the Authority.
    The Authority may purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any person who is or was a member, officer, employee, or agent of the Authority against any liability asserted against him or her and incurred by him or her in any such capacity or arising out of his or her status as such, whether or not the Authority would have the power to indemnify him or her against the liability under the provisions of this Section.
    The Authority shall be considered a State agency for purposes of receiving representation by the Attorney General. Members, officers, employees, and agents of the Authority shall be entitled to representation and indemnification under the State Employee Indemnification Act.

    (a) The General Assembly finds all of the following:
        (1) A fundamental goal of the people of this State,
    	
as expressed in Section 1 of Article X of the Illinois Constitution, is the educational development of all persons to the limits of their capacities. When a board of education faces financial difficulties, continued operation of the public school system is threatened.
        (2) A sound financial structure is essential to the
    	
continued operation of any school system. It is vital to commercial, educational, and cultural interests that public schools remain in operation. To achieve that goal, public school systems must have effective access to the private market to borrow short and long term funds.
        (3) To promote the financial integrity of districts,
    	
as defined in this Article, it is necessary to provide for the creation of financial oversight panels with the powers necessary to promote sound financial management and to ensure the continued operation of the public schools.
    (b) It is the purpose of this Article to provide a secure financial basis for the continued operation of public schools. The intention of the General Assembly, in creating this Article, is to establish procedures, provide powers, and impose restrictions to ensure the financial and educational integrity of public school districts, while leaving principal responsibility for the educational policies of public schools to their boards of education, consistent with the requirements for satisfying the public policy and purpose set forth in this Article.

        (2) The powers and duties of a Financial Oversight
    	
Panel established pursuant to this Article shall include the duties and obligations of financial oversight panels established under Article 1B of this Code, in addition to any duties and obligations established under this Article. However, if there is any conflict between the provisions of this Article and the provisions of Article 1B of this Code, the provisions of this Article control.
        (3) The Financial Oversight Panel, the school board,

The goals and objectives must be formally reviewed at agreed to intervals, but at least one time per year. Review shall include progress made and recommendations and modifications needed to achieve abolition of financial oversight provided for under Section 1H-115 of this Code.
    (c) Any school district having a Financial Oversight Panel established under Article 1B of this Code or any Financial Oversight Panel established under Article 1B may petition the State Board for the establishment of a Financial Oversight Panel under this Article and concurrent dissolution of the Article 1B Panel. All records, papers, books, funds, or other assets or liabilities belonging to the dissolving Financial Oversight Panel shall be transferred to the newly established Financial Oversight Panel.

    (a) The Panel may indemnify any member, officer, employee, or agent who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending, or completed action, suit, or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative, or investigative, by reason of the fact that he or she was a member, officer, employee, or agent of the Panel, against expenses (including attorney's fees, judgments, fines, and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by him or her in connection with the action, suit, or proceeding) if he or she acted in good faith and in a manner that he or she reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Panel and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe his or her conduct was unlawful. The termination of any action, suit, or proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, or conviction or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent, shall not, of itself, create a presumption that the person did not act in good faith in a manner that he or she reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Panel and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had reasonable cause to believe that his or her conduct was unlawful.
    To the extent that a member, officer, employee, or agent of the Panel has been successful, on the merits or otherwise, in the defense of any such action, suit, or proceeding referred to in this subsection (b) or in defense of any claim, issue, or matter therein, he or she shall be indemnified against expenses, including attorney's fees, actually and reasonably incurred by him or her in connection therewith. Any such indemnification shall be made by the Panel only as authorized in the specific case, upon a determination that indemnification of the member, officer, employee, or agent is proper in the circumstances because he or she has met the applicable standard of conduct. The determination shall be made (i) by the Panel by a majority vote of a quorum consisting of members who are not parties to the action, suit, or proceeding or (ii) if such a quorum is not obtainable or, even if obtainable, a quorum of disinterested members so directs, by independent legal counsel in a written opinion.
    Reasonable expenses incurred in defending an action, suit, or proceeding shall be paid by the Panel in advance of the final disposition of the action, suit, or proceeding, as authorized by the Panel in the specific case, upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of the member, officer, employee, or agent to repay the amount, unless it is ultimately determined that he or she is entitled to be indemnified by the Panel as authorized in this Section.
    Any member, officer, employee, or agent against whom any action, suit, or proceeding is brought may employ his or her own attorney to appear on his or her behalf.
    The right to indemnification accorded by this Section shall not limit any other right to indemnification to which the member, officer, employee, or agent may be entitled. Any rights under this Section shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors, and administrators of any member, officer, employee, or agent of the Panel.
    The Panel may purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any person who is or was a member, officer, employee, or agent of the Panel against any liability asserted against him or her and incurred by him or her in any such capacity or arising out of his or her status as such, whether or not the Panel could have the power to indemnify him or her against liability under the provisions of this Section.
    (b) The Panel shall be considered a State agency for purposes of receiving representation by the Attorney General. Members, officers, employees, and agents of the Panel shall be entitled to representation and indemnification under the State Employee Indemnification Act.
    (c) Abolition of the Panel pursuant to Section 1H-115 of this Code shall bar any remedy available against the Panel, its members, employees, or agents for any right or claim existing or any liability incurred prior to the abolition, unless the action or other proceeding is commenced prior to the expiration of 2 years after the date of the abolition.

    Sec. 2-3.13a. School records; transferring students.
    (a) The State Board of Education shall establish and implement rules requiring all of the public schools and all private or nonpublic elementary and secondary schools located in this State, whenever any such school has a student who is transferring to any other public elementary or secondary school located in this or in any other state, to forward within 10 days of notice of the student's transfer an unofficial record of that student's grades to the school to which such student is transferring. Each public school at the same time also shall forward to the school to which the student is transferring the remainder of the student's school student records as required by the Illinois School Student Records Act. In addition, if a student is transferring from a public school, whether located in this or any other state, from which the student has been suspended or expelled for knowingly possessing in a school building or on school grounds a weapon as defined in the Gun Free Schools Act (20 U.S.C. 8921 et seq.), for knowingly possessing, selling, or delivering in a school building or on school grounds a controlled substance or cannabis, or for battering a staff member of the school, and if the period of suspension or expulsion has not expired at the time the student attempts to transfer into another public school in the same or any other school district: (i) any school student records required to be transferred shall include the date and duration of the period of suspension or expulsion; and (ii) with the exception of transfers into the Department of Juvenile Justice school district, the student shall not be permitted to attend class in the public school into which he or she is transferring until the student has served the entire period of the suspension or expulsion imposed by the school from which the student is transferring, provided that the school board may approve the placement of the student in an alternative school program established under Article 13A of this Code. A school district may adopt a policy providing that if a student is suspended or expelled for any reason from any public or private school in this or any other state, the student must complete the entire term of the suspension or expulsion before being admitted into the school district. This policy may allow placement of the student in an alternative school program established under Article 13A of this Code, if available, for the remainder of the suspension or expulsion. Each public school and each private or nonpublic elementary or secondary school in this State shall within 10 days after the student has paid all of his or her outstanding fines and fees and at its own expense forward an official transcript of the scholastic records of each student transferring from that school in strict accordance with the provisions of this Section and the rules established by the State Board of Education as herein provided.
    (b) The State Board of Education shall develop a one-page standard form that Illinois school districts are required to provide to any student who is moving out of the school district and that contains the information about whether or not the student is "in good standing" and whether or not his or her medical records are up-to-date and complete. As used in this Section, "in good standing" means that the student is not being disciplined by a suspension or expulsion, but is entitled to attend classes. No school district is required to admit a new student who is transferring from another Illinois school district unless he or she can produce the standard form from the student's previous school district enrollment. No school district is required to admit a new student who is transferring from an out-of-state public school unless the parent or guardian of the student certifies in writing that the student is not currently serving a suspension or expulsion imposed by the school from which the student is transferring.
    (c) The State Board of Education shall, by rule, establish a system to provide for the accurate tracking of transfer students. This system shall, at a minimum, require that a student be counted as a dropout in the calculation of a school's or school district's annual student dropout rate unless the school or school district to which the student transferred (known hereafter in this subsection (c) as the transferee school or school district) sends notification to the school or school district from which the student transferred (known hereafter in this subsection (c) as the transferor school or school district) documenting that the student has enrolled in the transferee school or school district. This notification must occur on or before July 31 following the school year during which the student withdraws from the transferor school or school district or the student shall be counted in the calculation of the transferor school's or school district's annual student dropout rate. A request by the transferee school or school district to the transferor school or school district seeking the student's academic transcripts or medical records shall be considered without limitation adequate documentation of enrollment. Each transferor school or school district shall keep documentation of such transfer students for the minimum period provided in the Illinois School Student Records Act. All records indicating the school or school district to which a student transferred are subject to the Illinois School Student Records Act.

    Sec. 2-3.25f. State interventions.
    (a) The State Board of Education shall provide technical assistance to assist with the development and implementation of School and District Improvement Plans.
    Schools or school districts that fail to make reasonable efforts to implement an approved Improvement Plan may suffer loss of State funds by school district, attendance center, or program as the State Board of Education deems appropriate.
    (a-5) (Blank).
    (b) Beginning in 2017, if, after 3 years following its identification as a priority district under Section 2-3.25d-5 of this Code, a district does not make progress as measured by a reduction in achievement gaps commensurate with the targets in this State's approved accountability plan with the U.S. Department of Education, then the State Board of Education may (i) change the recognition status of the school district or school to nonrecognized or (ii) authorize the State Superintendent of Education to direct the reassignment of pupils or direct the reassignment or replacement of school district personnel. If a school district is nonrecognized in its entirety, it shall automatically be dissolved on July 1 following that nonrecognition and its territory realigned with another school district or districts by the regional board of school trustees in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 7-11 of the School Code. The effective date of the nonrecognition of a school shall be July 1 following the nonrecognition.
    (b-5) The State Board of Education shall also develop a system to provide assistance and resources to lower performing school districts. At a minimum, the State Board shall identify school districts to receive priority services, to be known as priority districts under Section 2-3.25d-5 of this Code. The school district shall provide the exclusive bargaining representative with a 5-day notice that the district has been identified as a priority district. In addition, the State Board may, by rule, develop other categories of low-performing schools and school districts to receive services.
    Based on the results of the district needs assessment under Section 2-3.25d-5 of this Code, the State Board of Education shall work with the district to provide technical assistance and professional development, in partnership with the district, to implement a continuous improvement plan that would increase outcomes for students.

    (105 ILCS 5/2-3.25f-5)
    Sec. 2-3.25f-5. Independent Authority.
    (a) The General Assembly finds all of the following:
        (1) A fundamental goal of the people of this State,
    	
as expressed in Section 1 of Article X of the Illinois Constitution, is the educational development of all persons to the limits of their capacities. When a school board faces governance difficulties, continued operation of the public school system is threatened.
        (2) Sound school board governance, academic
    	
achievement, and sound financial structure are essential to the continued operation of any school system. It is vital to commercial, educational, and cultural interests that public schools remain in operation. To achieve that goal, public school systems must have effective leadership.
        (3) To promote the sound operation of districts, as
    	
defined in this Section, it may be necessary to provide for the creation of independent authorities with the powers necessary to promote sound governance, sound academic planning, and sound financial management and to ensure the continued operation of the public schools.
        (4) It is the purpose of this Section to provide for
    	
a sound basis for the continued operation of public schools. The intention of the General Assembly, in creating this Section, is to establish procedures, provide powers, and impose restrictions to ensure the educational integrity of public school districts.
    (b) As used in this Section:
    "Board" means a school board of a district.
    "Chairperson" means the Chairperson of the Independent Authority.
    "District" means any school district having a population of not more than 500,000.
    "State Board" means the State Board of Education.
    "State Superintendent" means the State Superintendent of Education.
    (c) The State Board has the power to direct the State Superintendent to remove a board. Boards may be removed when the criteria provided for in subsection (d) of this Section are met. At no one time may the State Board remove more than 4 school boards and establish Independent Authorities pursuant to subsection (e) of this Section.
    If the State Board proposes to direct the State Superintendent to remove a board from a district, board members shall receive individual written notice of the intended removal. Written notice must be provided at least 30 calendar days before a hearing is held by the State Board. This notice shall identify the basis for proposed removal.
    Board members are entitled to a hearing, during which time each board member shall have the opportunity to respond individually, both orally and through written comments, to the basis laid out in the notice. Written comments must be submitted to the State Board on or before the hearing.
    Board members are entitled to be represented by counsel at the hearing, but counsel must not be paid with district funds, unless the State Board decides that the board will not be removed and then the board members may be reimbursed for all reasonable attorney's fees by the district.
    The State Board shall make a final decision on removal immediately following the hearing or at its next regularly scheduled or special meeting. In no event may the decision be made later than the next regularly scheduled meeting.
    The State Board shall issue a final written decision. If the State Board directs the State Superintendent to remove the board, the State Superintendent shall do so within 30 days after the written decision. Following the removal of the board, the State Superintendent shall establish an Independent Authority pursuant to subsection (e) of this Section.
    If there is a financial oversight panel operating in the district pursuant to Article 1B or 1H of this Code, the State Board may, at its discretion, abolish the panel.
    (d) The State Board may require priority districts, as defined in subsection (b-5) of Section 2-3.25f of this Code, to seek accreditation through an independent accreditation organization chosen by the State Board and paid for by the State. The State Board may direct the State Superintendent to remove board members pursuant to subsection (c) of this Section in any district in which the district is unable to obtain accreditation in whole or in part due to reasons specifically related to school board governance. When determining if a district has failed to meet the standards for accreditation specifically related to school board governance, the accreditation entity shall take into account the overall academic, fiscal, and operational condition of the district and consider whether the board has failed to protect district assets, to direct sound administrative and academic policy, to abide by basic governance principles, including those set forth in district policies, and to conduct itself with professionalism and care and in a legally, ethically, and financially responsible manner. When considering if a board has failed in these areas, the accreditation entity shall consider some or all of the following factors:
        (1) Failure to protect district assets by, without
    	
limitation, incidents of fiscal fraud or misappropriation of district funds; acts of neglecting the district's building conditions; a failure to meet regularly scheduled, payroll-period obligations when due; a failure to abide by competitive bidding laws; a failure to prevent an audit finding of material internal control weaknesses; a failure to comply with required accounting principles; a failure to develop and implement a comprehensive, risk-management plan; a failure to provide financial information or cooperate with the State Superintendent; or a failure to file an annual financial report, an annual budget, a deficit reduction plan, or other financial information as required by law.
        (2) Failure to direct sound administrative and
    	
academic policy by, without limitation, hiring staff who do not meet minimal certification requirements for the positions being filled or who do not meet the customary qualifications held by those occupying similar positions in other school districts; a failure to avoid conflicts of interest as it relates to hiring or other contractual obligations; a failure to provide minimum graduation requirements and curricular requirements of the School Code and regulations; a failure to provide a minimum school term as required by law; or a failure to adopt and implement policies and practices that promote conditions that support student learning, effective instruction, and assessment that produce equitable and challenging learning experiences for all students.
        (3) Failure to abide by basic governance principles
    	
by, without limitation, a failure to comply with the mandated oath of office; a failure to adopt and abide by sound local governance policies; a failure to abide by the principle that official action by the board occurs only through a duly-called and legally conducted meeting of the board; a failure to abide by majority decisions of the board; a failure to protect the privacy of students; a failure to ensure that board decisions and actions are in accordance with defined roles and responsibilities; or a failure of the board to protect, support, and respect the autonomy of a system to accomplish goals for improvement in student learning and instruction and to manage day-to-day operations of the school system and its schools, including maintaining the distinction between the board's roles and responsibilities and those of administrative leadership.
        (4) Failure to conduct itself in a legally,
    	
ethically, and financially responsible manner by, without limitation, a failure to act in accordance with the Constitution of the United States of America and the Constitution of the State of Illinois and within the scope of State and federal laws; laws, including a failure to comply with provisions of the School Code, the Open Meetings Act, and the Freedom of Information Act and federal and State laws that protect the rights of protected categories of students; a failure to comply with all district policies and procedures and all State rules; or a failure to comply with the governmental entities provisions of the State Officials and Employees Ethics Act, including the gift ban and prohibited political activities provisions.
    (e) Upon removal of the board, the State Superintendent shall establish an Independent Authority. Upon establishment of an Independent Authority, there is established a body both corporate and politic to be known as the "(Name of the School District) Independent Authority", which in this name shall exercise all of the authority vested in an Independent Authority by this Section and by the name may sue and be sued in all courts and places where judicial proceedings are had.
    (f) Upon establishment of an Independent Authority under subsection (e) of this Section, the State Superintendent shall, within 30 working days thereafter and in consultation with State and locally elected officials, appoint 5 or 7 members to serve on an Independent Authority for the district. Members appointed to the Independent Authority shall serve at the pleasure of the State Superintendent. The State Superintendent shall designate one of the members of the Independent Authority to serve as its chairperson. In the event of vacancy or resignation, the State Superintendent shall, within 15 working days after receiving notice, appoint a successor to serve out that member's term. If the State Board has abolished a financial oversight panel pursuant to subsection (c) of this Section, the State Superintendent may appoint former members of the panel to the Independent Authority. These members may serve as part of the 5 or 7 members or may be appointed in addition to the 5 or 7 members, with the Independent Authority not to exceed 9 members in total.
    Members of the Independent Authority must be selected primarily on the basis of their experience and knowledge in education policy and governance, with consideration given to persons knowledgeable in the operation of a school district. A member of the Independent Authority must be a registered voter as provided in the general election law, must not be a school trustee, and must not be a child sex offender as defined in Section 11-9.3 of the Criminal Code of 2012. A majority of the members of the Independent Authority must be residents of the district that the Independent Authority serves. A member of the Independent Authority may not be an employee of the district, nor may a member have a direct financial interest in the district.
    Independent Authority members may be reimbursed by the district for travel if they live more than 25 miles away from the district's headquarters and other necessary expenses incurred in the performance of their official duties. The amount reimbursed members for their expenses must be charged to the school district.
    With the exception of the Chairperson, the Independent Authority may elect such officers as it deems appropriate.
    The first meeting of the Independent Authority must be held at the call of the Chairperson. The Independent Authority shall prescribe the times and places for its meetings and the manner in which regular and special meetings may be called and shall comply with the Open Meetings Act.
    All Independent Authority members must complete the training required of school board members under Section 10-16a of this Code.
    (g) The purpose of the Independent Authority is to operate the district. The Independent Authority shall have all of the powers and duties of a board and all other powers necessary to meet its responsibilities and to carry out its purpose and the purposes of this Section and that may be requisite or proper for the maintenance, operation, and development of any school or schools under the jurisdiction of the Independent Authority. This grant of powers does not release an Independent Authority from any duty imposed upon it by this Code or any other law.
    The Independent Authority shall have no power to unilaterally cancel or modify any collective bargaining agreement in force upon the date of creation of the Independent Authority.
    (h) The Independent Authority may prepare and file with the State Superintendent a proposal for emergency financial assistance for the school district and for the operations budget of the Independent Authority, in accordance with Section 1B-8 of this Code. A district may receive both a loan and a grant.
    (i) An election for board members must not be held in a district upon the establishment of an Independent Authority and is suspended until the next regularly scheduled school board election that takes place no less than 2 years following the establishment of the Independent Authority. For this first election, 3 school board members must be elected to serve out terms of 4 years and until successors are elected and have qualified. Members of the Independent Authority are eligible to run for election in the district, provided that they meet all other eligibility requirements of Section 10-10 of this Code. Following this election, the school board shall consist of the newly elected members and any remaining members of the Independent Authority. The majority of this board must be residents of the district. The State Superintendent must appoint new members who are residents to the Independent Authority if necessary to maintain this majority. At the next school board election, 4 school board members must be elected to serve out terms of 4 years and until successors are elected and have qualified. For purposes of these first 2 elections, the school board members must be elected at-large. In districts where board members were previously elected using an alternative format pursuant to Article 9 of this Code, following these first 2 elections, the voting shall automatically revert back to the original form. Following the election, any remaining Independent Authority members shall serve in the district as an oversight panel until such time as the district meets the governance standards necessary to achieve accreditation. If some or all of the Independent Authority members have been elected to the board, the State Superintendent may, in his or her discretion, appoint new members to the Independent Authority pursuant to subsection (f) of this Section. The school board shall get approval of all actions by the Independent Authority during the time the Independent Authority serves as an oversight panel.
    Board members who were removed pursuant to subsection (c) of this Section are ineligible to run for school board in the district for 10 years following the abolition of the Independent Authority pursuant to subsection (l) of this Section. However, board members who were removed pursuant to subsection (c) of this Section and were appointed to the Independent Authority by the State Superintendent are eligible to run for school board in the district.
    (j) The Independent Authority, upon its members taking office and annually thereafter and upon request, shall prepare and submit to the State Superintendent a report on the state of the district, including without limitation the academic improvement and financial situation of the district. This report must be submitted annually on or before March 1 of each year. The State Superintendent shall provide copies of any and all reports to the regional office of education for the district and to the State Senator and Representative representing the area where the district is located.
    (k) The district shall render such services to and permit the use of its facilities and resources by the Independent Authority at no charge as may be requested by the Independent Authority. Any State agency, unit of local government, or school district may, within its lawful powers and duties, render such services to the Independent Authority as may be requested by the Independent Authority.
    (l) An Independent Authority must be abolished when the district, following the election of the full board, meets the governance standards necessary to achieve accreditation status by an independent accreditation agency chosen by the State Board. The abolition of the Independent Authority shall be done by the State Board and take place within 30 days after the determination of the accreditation agency.
    Upon abolition of the Independent Authority, all powers and duties allowed by this Code to be exercised by a school board shall be transferred to the elected school board.
    (m) The Independent Authority must be indemnified through insurance purchased by the district. The district shall purchase insurance through which the Independent Authority is to be indemnified.
    The district retains the duty to represent and to indemnify Independent Authority members following the abolition of the Independent Authority for any cause of action or remedy available against the Independent Authority, its members, its employees, or its agents for any right or claim existing or any liability incurred prior to the abolition.
    The insurance shall indemnify and protect districts, Independent Authority members, employees, volunteer personnel authorized in Sections 10-22.34, 10-22.34a, and 10-22.34b of this Code, mentors of certified or licensed staff as authorized in Article 21A and Sections 2-3.53a, 2-3.53b, and 34-18.33 of this Code, and student teachers against civil rights damage claims and suits, constitutional rights damage claims and suits, and death and bodily injury and property damage claims and suits, including defense thereof, when damages are sought for negligent or wrongful acts alleged to have been committed in the scope of employment, under the direction of the Independent Authority, or related to any mentoring services provided to certified or licensed staff of the district. Such indemnification and protection shall extend to persons who were members of an Independent Authority, employees of an Independent Authority, authorized volunteer personnel, mentors of certified or licensed staff, or student teachers at the time of the incident from which a claim arises. No agent may be afforded indemnification or protection unless he or she was a member of an Independent Authority, an employee of an Independent Authority, an authorized volunteer, a mentor of certified or licensed staff, or a student teacher at the time of the incident from which the claim arises.
    (n) The State Board may adopt rules as may be necessary for the administration of this Section.

On September 1, 2014, any previously authorized waiver or modification from such requirements shall terminate.
    (c) Eligible applicants, as a matter of inherent managerial policy, and any Independent Authority established under Section 2-3.25f-5 of this Code may submit an application for a waiver or modification authorized under this Section. Each application must include a written request by the eligible applicant or Independent Authority and must demonstrate that the intent of the mandate can be addressed in a more effective, efficient, or economical manner or be based upon a specific plan for improved student performance and school improvement. Any eligible applicant requesting a waiver or modification for the reason that intent of the mandate can be addressed in a more economical manner shall include in the application a fiscal analysis showing current expenditures on the mandate and projected savings resulting from the waiver or modification. Applications and plans developed by eligible applicants must be approved by the board or regional superintendent of schools applying on behalf of schools or programs operated by the regional office of education following a public hearing on the application and plan and the opportunity for the board or regional superintendent to hear testimony from staff directly involved in its implementation, parents, and students. The time period for such testimony shall be separate from the time period established by the eligible applicant for public comment on other matters.
    (c-5) If the applicant is a school district, then the district shall post information that sets forth the time, date, place, and general subject matter of the public hearing on its Internet website at least 14 days prior to the hearing. If the district is requesting to increase the fee charged for driver education authorized pursuant to Section 27-24.2 of this Code, the website information shall include the proposed amount of the fee the district will request. All school districts must publish a notice of the public hearing at least 7 days prior to the hearing in a newspaper of general circulation within the school district that sets forth the time, date, place, and general subject matter of the hearing. Districts requesting to increase the fee charged for driver education shall include in the published notice the proposed amount of the fee the district will request. If the applicant is a joint agreement or regional superintendent, then the joint agreement or regional superintendent shall post information that sets forth the time, date, place, and general subject matter of the public hearing on its Internet website at least 14 days prior to the hearing. If the joint agreement or regional superintendent is requesting to increase the fee charged for driver education authorized pursuant to Section 27-24.2 of this Code, the website information shall include the proposed amount of the fee the applicant will request. All joint agreements and regional superintendents must publish a notice of the public hearing at least 7 days prior to the hearing in a newspaper of general circulation in each school district that is a member of the joint agreement or that is served by the educational service region that sets forth the time, date, place, and general subject matter of the hearing, provided that a notice appearing in a newspaper generally circulated in more than one school district shall be deemed to fulfill this requirement with respect to all of the affected districts. Joint agreements or regional superintendents requesting to increase the fee charged for driver education shall include in the published notice the proposed amount of the fee the applicant will request. The eligible applicant must notify either electronically or in writing the affected exclusive collective bargaining agent and those State legislators representing the eligible applicant's territory of its intent to seek approval of a waiver or modification and of the hearing to be held to take testimony from staff. The affected exclusive collective bargaining agents shall be notified of such public hearing at least 7 days prior to the date of the hearing and shall be allowed to attend such public hearing. The eligible applicant shall attest to compliance with all of the notification and procedural requirements set forth in this Section.
    (d) A request for a waiver or modification of administrative rules and regulations or for a modification of mandates contained in this School Code shall be submitted to the State Board of Education within 15 days after approval by the board or regional superintendent of schools. The application as submitted to the State Board of Education shall include a description of the public hearing. Following receipt of the waiver or modification request, the State Board shall have 45 days to review the application and request. If the State Board fails to disapprove the application within that 45-day period, the waiver or modification shall be deemed granted. The State Board may disapprove any request if it is not based upon sound educational practices, endangers the health or safety of students or staff, compromises equal opportunities for learning, or fails to demonstrate that the intent of the rule or mandate can be addressed in a more effective, efficient, or economical manner or have improved student performance as a primary goal. Any request disapproved by the State Board may be appealed to the General Assembly by the eligible applicant as outlined in this Section.
    A request for a waiver from mandates contained in this School Code shall be submitted to the State Board within 15 days after approval by the board or regional superintendent of schools. The application as submitted to the State Board of Education shall include a description of the public hearing. The description shall include, but need not be limited to, the means of notice, the number of people in attendance, the number of people who spoke as proponents or opponents of the waiver, a brief description of their comments, and whether there were any written statements submitted. The State Board shall review the applications and requests for completeness and shall compile the requests in reports to be filed with the General Assembly. The State Board shall file reports outlining the waivers requested by eligible applicants and appeals by eligible applicants of requests disapproved by the State Board with the Senate and the House of Representatives before each March 1 and October 1.
    The report shall be reviewed by a panel of 4 members consisting of:
        (1) the Speaker of the House of Representatives;
        (2) the Minority Leader of the House of
    	
Representatives;
        (3) the President of the Senate; and
        (4) the Minority Leader of the Senate.
The State Board of Education may provide the panel recommendations on waiver requests. The members of the panel shall review the report submitted by the State Board of Education and submit to the State Board of Education any notice of further consideration to any waiver request within 14 days after the member receives the report. If 3 or more of the panel members submit a notice of further consideration to any waiver request contained within the report, the State Board of Education shall submit the waiver request to the General Assembly for consideration. If less than 3 panel members submit a notice of further consideration to a waiver request, the waiver may be approved, denied, or modified by the State Board. If the State Board does not act on a waiver request within 10 days, then the waiver request is approved. If the waiver request is denied by the State Board, it shall submit the waiver request to the General Assembly for consideration.
    The General Assembly may disapprove any waiver request submitted to the General Assembly pursuant to this subsection (d) in whole or in part within 60 calendar days after each house of the General Assembly next convenes after the waiver request is submitted by adoption of a resolution by a record vote of the majority of members elected in each house. If the General Assembly fails to disapprove any waiver request or appealed request within such 60-day period, the waiver or modification shall be deemed granted. Any resolution adopted by the General Assembly disapproving a report of the State Board in whole or in part shall be binding on the State Board.
    (e) An approved waiver or modification may remain in effect for a period not to exceed 5 school years and may be renewed upon application by the eligible applicant. However, such waiver or modification may be changed within that 5-year period by a board or regional superintendent of schools applying on behalf of schools or programs operated by the regional office of education following the procedure as set forth in this Section for the initial waiver or modification request. If neither the State Board of Education nor the General Assembly disapproves, the change is deemed granted.

    (105 ILCS 5/2-3.25o)
    Sec. 2-3.25o. Registration and recognition of non-public elementary and secondary schools.
    (a) Findings. The General Assembly finds and declares (i) that the Constitution of the State of Illinois provides that a "fundamental goal of the People of the State is the educational development of all persons to the limits of their capacities" and (ii) that the educational development of every school student serves the public purposes of the State. In order to ensure that all Illinois students and teachers have the opportunity to enroll and work in State-approved educational institutions and programs, the State Board of Education shall provide for the voluntary registration and recognition of non-public elementary and secondary schools.
    (b) Registration. All non-public elementary and secondary schools in the State of Illinois may voluntarily register with the State Board of Education on an annual basis. Registration shall be completed in conformance with procedures prescribed by the State Board of Education. Information required for registration shall include assurances of compliance (i) with federal and State laws regarding health examination and immunization, attendance, length of term, and nondiscrimination and (ii) with applicable fire and health safety requirements.
    (c) Recognition. All non-public elementary and secondary schools in the State of Illinois may voluntarily seek the status of "Non-public School Recognition" from the State Board of Education. This status may be obtained by compliance with administrative guidelines and review procedures as prescribed by the State Board of Education. The guidelines and procedures must recognize that some of the aims and the financial bases of non-public schools are different from public schools and will not be identical to those for public schools, nor will they be more burdensome. The guidelines and procedures must also recognize the diversity of non-public schools and shall not impinge upon the noneducational relationships between those schools and their clientele.
    (c-5) Prohibition against recognition. A non-public elementary or secondary school may not obtain "Non-public School Recognition" status unless the school requires all certified and non-certified applicants for employment with the school, after July 1, 2007, to authorize a fingerprint-based criminal history records check as a condition of employment to determine if such applicants have been convicted of any of the enumerated criminal or drug offenses set forth in Section 21B-80 of this Code or have been convicted, within 7 years of the application for employment, of any other felony under the laws of this State or of any offense committed or attempted in any other state or against the laws of the United States that, if committed or attempted in this State, would have been punishable as a felony under the laws of this State.
    Authorization for the check shall be furnished by the applicant to the school, except that if the applicant is a substitute teacher seeking employment in more than one non-public school, a teacher seeking concurrent part-time employment positions with more than one non-public school (as a reading specialist, special education teacher, or otherwise), or an educational support personnel employee seeking employment positions with more than one non-public school, then only one of the non-public schools employing the individual shall request the authorization. Upon receipt of this authorization, the non-public school shall submit the applicant's name, sex, race, date of birth, social security number, fingerprint images, and other identifiers, as prescribed by the Department of State Police, to the Department of State Police.
    The Department of State Police and Federal Bureau of Investigation shall furnish, pursuant to a fingerprint-based criminal history records check, records of convictions, forever and hereafter, until expunged, to the president or principal of the non-public school that requested the check. The Department of State Police shall charge that school a fee for conducting such check, which fee must be deposited into the State Police Services Fund and must not exceed the cost of the inquiry. Subject to appropriations for these purposes, the State Superintendent of Education shall reimburse non-public schools for fees paid to obtain criminal history records checks under this Section.
    A non-public school may not obtain recognition status unless the school also performs a check of the Statewide Sex Offender Database, as authorized by the Sex Offender Community Notification Law, for each applicant for employment, after July 1, 2007, to determine whether the applicant has been adjudicated a sex offender.
    Any information concerning the record of convictions obtained by a non-public school's president or principal under this Section is confidential and may be disseminated only to the governing body of the non-public school or any other person necessary to the decision of hiring the applicant for employment. A copy of the record of convictions obtained from the Department of State Police shall be provided to the applicant for employment. Upon a check of the Statewide Sex Offender Database, the non-public school shall notify the applicant as to whether or not the applicant has been identified in the Sex Offender Database as a sex offender. Any information concerning the records of conviction obtained by the non-public school's president or principal under this Section for a substitute teacher seeking employment in more than one non-public school, a teacher seeking concurrent part-time employment positions with more than one non-public school (as a reading specialist, special education teacher, or otherwise), or an educational support personnel employee seeking employment positions with more than one non-public school may be shared with another non-public school's principal or president to which the applicant seeks employment. Any unauthorized release of confidential information may be a violation of Section 7 of the Criminal Identification Act.
    No non-public school may obtain recognition status that knowingly employs a person, hired after July 1, 2007, for whom a Department of State Police and Federal Bureau of Investigation fingerprint-based criminal history records check and a Statewide Sex Offender Database check has not been initiated or who has been convicted of any offense enumerated in Section 21B-80 of this Code or any offense committed or attempted in any other state or against the laws of the United States that, if committed or attempted in this State, would have been punishable as one or more of those offenses. No non-public school may obtain recognition status under this Section that knowingly employs a person who has been found to be the perpetrator of sexual or physical abuse of a minor under 18 years of age pursuant to proceedings under Article II of the Juvenile Court Act of 1987.
    In order to obtain recognition status under this Section, a non-public school must require compliance with the provisions of this subsection (c-5) from all employees of persons or firms holding contracts with the school, including, but not limited to, food service workers, school bus drivers, and other transportation employees, who have direct, daily contact with pupils. Any information concerning the records of conviction or identification as a sex offender of any such employee obtained by the non-public school principal or president must be promptly reported to the school's governing body.
    Prior to the commencement of any student teaching experience or required internship (which is referred to as student teaching in this Section) in any non-public elementary or secondary school that has obtained or seeks to obtain recognition status under this Section, a student teacher is required to authorize a fingerprint-based criminal history records check. Authorization for and payment of the costs of the check must be furnished by the student teacher to the chief administrative officer of the non-public school where the student teaching is to be completed. Upon receipt of this authorization and payment, the chief administrative officer of the non-public school shall submit the student teacher's name, sex, race, date of birth, social security number, fingerprint images, and other identifiers, as prescribed by the Department of State Police, to the Department of State Police. The Department of State Police and the Federal Bureau of Investigation shall furnish, pursuant to a fingerprint-based criminal history records check, records of convictions, forever and hereinafter, until expunged, to the chief administrative officer of the non-public school that requested the check. The Department of State Police shall charge the school a fee for conducting the check, which fee must be passed on to the student teacher, must not exceed the cost of the inquiry, and must be deposited into the State Police Services Fund. The school shall further perform a check of the Statewide Sex Offender Database, as authorized by the Sex Offender Community Notification Law, and of the Statewide Murderer and Violent Offender Against Youth Database, as authorized by the Murderer and Violent Offender Against Youth Registration Act, for each student teacher. No school that has obtained or seeks to obtain recognition status under this Section may knowingly allow a person to student teach for whom a criminal history records check, a Statewide Sex Offender Database check, and a Statewide Murderer and Violent Offender Against Youth Database check have not been completed and reviewed by the chief administrative officer of the non-public school.
    A copy of the record of convictions obtained from the Department of State Police must be provided to the student teacher. Any information concerning the record of convictions obtained by the chief administrative officer of the non-public school is confidential and may be transmitted only to the chief administrative officer of the non-public school or his or her designee, the State Superintendent of Education, the State Educator Preparation and Licensure Board, or, for clarification purposes, the Department of State Police or the Statewide Sex Offender Database or Statewide Murderer and Violent Offender Against Youth Database. Any unauthorized release of confidential information may be a violation of Section 7 of the Criminal Identification Act.
    No school that has obtained or seeks to obtain recognition status under this Section may knowingly allow a person to student teach who has been convicted of any offense that would subject him or her to license suspension or revocation pursuant to Section 21B-80 of this Code or who has been found to be the perpetrator of sexual or physical abuse of a minor under 18 years of age pursuant to proceedings under Article II of the Juvenile Court Act of 1987.
    (d) Public purposes. The provisions of this Section are in the public interest, for the public benefit, and serve secular public purposes.
    (e) Definition. For purposes of this Section, a non-public school means any non-profit, non-home-based, and non-public elementary or secondary school that is in compliance with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and attendance at which satisfies the requirements of Section 26-1 of this Code.

    (105 ILCS 5/2-3.33) (from Ch. 122, par. 2-3.33)
    Sec. 2-3.33. Recomputation of claims. To recompute within 3 years from the final date for filing of a claim any claim for general State aid reimbursement to any school district and one year from the final date for filing of a claim for evidence-based funding if the claim has been found to be incorrect and to adjust subsequent claims accordingly, and to recompute and adjust any such claims within 6 years from the final date for filing when there has been an adverse court or administrative agency decision on the merits affecting the tax revenues of the school district. However, no such adjustment shall be made regarding equalized assessed valuation unless the district's equalized assessed valuation is changed by greater than $250,000 or 2%. Any adjustments for claims recomputed for the 2016-2017 school year and prior school years shall be applied to the apportionment of evidence-based funding in Section 18-8.15 of this Code beginning in the 2017-2018 school year and thereafter. However, the recomputation of a claim for evidence-based funding for a school district shall not require the recomputation of claims for all districts, and the State Board of Education shall only make recomputations of evidence-based funding for those districts where an adjustment is required.
    Except in the case of an adverse court or administrative agency decision, no recomputation of a State aid claim shall be made pursuant to this Section as a result of a reduction in the assessed valuation of a school district from the assessed valuation of the district reported to the State Board of Education by the Department of Revenue under Section 18-8.05 or 18-8.15 of this Code unless the requirements of Section 16-15 of the Property Tax Code and Section 2-3.84 of this Code are complied with in all respects.
    This paragraph applies to all requests for recomputation of a general State aid or evidence-based funding claim received after June 30, 2003. In recomputing a general State aid or evidence-based funding claim that was originally calculated using an extension limitation equalized assessed valuation under paragraph (3) of subsection (G) of Section 18-8.05 of this Code or Section 18-8.15 of this Code, a qualifying reduction in equalized assessed valuation shall be deducted from the extension limitation equalized assessed valuation that was used in calculating the original claim.
    From the total amount of general State aid or evidence-based funding to be provided to districts, adjustments as a result of recomputation under this Section together with adjustments under Section 2-3.84 must not exceed $25 million, in the aggregate for all districts under both Sections combined, of the general State aid or evidence-based funding appropriation in any fiscal year; if necessary, amounts shall be prorated among districts. If it is necessary to prorate claims under this paragraph, then that portion of each prorated claim that is approved but not paid in the current fiscal year may be resubmitted as a valid claim in the following fiscal year.

    Sec. 2-3.64a-5. State goals and assessment.
    (a) For the assessment and accountability purposes of this Section, "students" includes those students enrolled in a public or State-operated elementary school, secondary school, or cooperative or joint agreement with a governing body or board of control, a charter school operating in compliance with the Charter Schools Law, a school operated by a regional office of education under Section 13A-3 of this Code, or a public school administered by a local public agency or the Department of Human Services.
    (b) The State Board of Education shall establish the academic standards that are to be applicable to students who are subject to State assessments under this Section. The State Board of Education shall not establish any such standards in final form without first providing opportunities for public participation and local input in the development of the final academic standards. Those opportunities shall include a well-publicized period of public comment and opportunities to file written comments.
    (c) Beginning no later than the 2014-2015 school year, the State Board of Education shall annually assess all students enrolled in grades 3 through 8 in English language arts and mathematics.
    Beginning no later than the 2017-2018 school year, the State Board of Education shall annually assess all students in science at one grade in grades 3 through 5, at one grade in grades 6 through 8, and at one grade in grades 9 through 12.
    The State Board of Education shall annually assess schools that operate a secondary education program, as defined in Section 22-22 of this Code, in English language arts and mathematics. The State Board of Education shall administer no more than 3 assessments, per student, of English language arts and mathematics for students in a secondary education program. One of these assessments shall be recognized by this State's public institutions of higher education, as defined in the Board of Higher Education Act, for the purpose of student application or admissions consideration. The assessment administered by the State Board of Education for the purpose of student application to or admissions consideration by institutions of higher education must be administered on a school day during regular student attendance hours.
    Students who do not take the State's final accountability assessment or its approved alternate assessment may not receive a regular high school diploma unless the student is exempted from taking the State assessments under subsection (d) of this Section because the student is enrolled in a program of adult and continuing education, as defined in the Adult Education Act, or the student is identified by the State Board of Education, through rules, as being exempt from the assessment.
    The State Board of Education shall not assess students under this Section in subjects not required by this Section.
    Districts shall inform their students of the timelines and procedures applicable to their participation in every yearly administration of the State assessments. The State Board of Education shall establish periods of time in each school year during which State assessments shall occur to meet the objectives of this Section.
    The requirements of this subsection do not apply if the State Board of Education has received a waiver from the administration of assessments from the U.S. Department of Education.
    (d) Every individualized educational program as described in Article 14 shall identify if the State assessment or components thereof require accommodation for the student. The State Board of Education shall develop rules governing the administration of an alternate assessment that may be available to students for whom participation in this State's regular assessments is not appropriate, even with accommodations as allowed under this Section.
    Students receiving special education services whose individualized educational programs identify them as eligible for the alternative State assessments nevertheless shall have the option of also taking this State's regular final accountability assessment, which shall be administered in accordance with the eligible accommodations appropriate for meeting these students' respective needs.
    All students determined to be English learners shall participate in the State assessments. The scores of those students who have been enrolled in schools in the United States for less than 12 months may not be used for the purposes of accountability. Any student determined to be an English learner shall receive appropriate assessment accommodations, including language supports, which shall be established by rule. Approved assessment accommodations must be provided until the student's English language skills develop to the extent that the student is no longer considered to be an English learner, as demonstrated through a State-identified English language proficiency assessment.
    (e) The results or scores of each assessment taken under this Section shall be made available to the parents of each student.
    In each school year, the scores attained by a student on the final accountability assessment must be placed in the student's permanent record pursuant to rules that the State Board of Education shall adopt for that purpose in accordance with Section 3 of the Illinois School Student Records Act. In each school year, the scores attained by a student on the State assessments administered in grades 3 through 8 must be placed in the student's temporary record.
    (f) All schools shall administer the State's academic assessment of English language proficiency to all children determined to be English learners.
    (g) All schools in this State that are part of the sample drawn by the National Center for Education Statistics, in collaboration with their school districts and the State Board of Education, shall administer the academic assessments under the National Assessment of Educational Progress carried out under Section 411(b)(2) of the federal National Education Statistics Act of 1994 (20 U.S.C. 9010) if the U.S. Secretary of Education pays the costs of administering the assessments.
    (h) (Blank).
    (i) For the purposes of this subsection (i), "academically based assessments" means assessments consisting of questions and answers that are measurable and quantifiable to measure the knowledge, skills, and ability of students in the subject matters covered by the assessments. All assessments administered pursuant to this Section must be academically based assessments. The scoring of academically based assessments shall be reliable, valid, and fair and shall meet the guidelines for assessment development and use prescribed by the American Psychological Association, the National Council on Measurement in Education, and the American Educational Research Association.
    The State Board of Education shall review the use of all assessment item types in order to ensure that they are valid and reliable indicators of student performance aligned to the learning standards being assessed and that the development, administration, and scoring of these item types are justifiable in terms of cost.
    (j) The State Superintendent of Education shall appoint a committee of no more than 21 members, consisting of parents, teachers, school administrators, school board members, assessment experts, regional superintendents of schools, and citizens, to review the State assessments administered by the State Board of Education. The Committee shall select one of its members as its chairperson. The Committee shall meet on an ongoing basis to review the content and design of the assessments (including whether the requirements of subsection (i) of this Section have been met), the time and money expended at the local and State levels to prepare for and administer the assessments, the collective results of the assessments as measured against the stated purpose of assessing student performance, and other issues involving the assessments identified by the Committee.

    (a) For the purposes of this Section, "kindergarten" includes both full-day and half-day kindergarten programs.
    (b) Beginning no later than the 2021-2022 school year, the State Board of Education shall annually assess all public school students entering kindergarten using a common assessment tool, unless the State Board determines that a student is otherwise exempt. The common assessment tool must assess multiple developmental domains, including literacy, language, mathematics, and social and emotional development. The assessment must be valid, reliable, and developmentally appropriate to formatively assess a child's development and readiness for kindergarten.
    (c) Results from the assessment may be used by the school to understand the child's development and readiness for kindergarten, to tailor instruction, and to measure the child's progress over time. Assessment results may also be used to identify a need for the professional development of teachers and early childhood educators and to inform State-level and district-level policies and resource allocation.
    The school shall make the assessment results available to the child's parent or guardian.
    The assessment results may not be used (i) to prevent a child from enrolling in kindergarten or (ii) as the sole measure used in determining the grade promotion or retention of a student.
    (d) On an annual basis, the State Board shall report publicly, at a minimum, data from the assessment for the State overall and for each school district. The State Board's report must disaggregate data by race and ethnicity, household income, students who are English learners, and students who have an individualized education program.
    (e) The State Superintendent of Education shall appoint a committee of no more than 21 members, consisting of parents, teachers, school administrators, assessment experts, and regional superintendents of schools, to review, on an ongoing basis, the content and design of the assessment, the collective results of the assessment as measured against kindergarten-readiness standards, and other issues involving the assessment as identified by the committee.
    The committee shall make periodic recommendations to the State Superintendent of Education and the General Assembly concerning the assessments.

To establish projects to offer modified instructional programs or other services designed to prevent students from dropping out of school, including programs pursuant to Section 2-3.41, and to serve as a part time or full time option in lieu of regular school attendance and to award grants to local school districts, educational service regions or community college districts from appropriated funds to assist districts in establishing such projects. The education agency may operate its own program or enter into a contract with another not-for-profit entity to implement the program. The projects shall allow dropouts, up to and including age 21, potential dropouts, including truants, uninvolved, unmotivated and disaffected students, as defined by State Board of Education rules and regulations, to enroll, as an alternative to regular school attendance, in an optional education program which may be established by school board policy and is in conformance with rules adopted by the State Board of Education. Truants' Alternative and Optional Education programs funded pursuant to this Section shall be planned by a student, the student's parents or legal guardians, unless the student is 18 years or older, and school officials and shall culminate in an individualized optional education plan. Such plan shall focus on academic or vocational skills, or both, and may include, but not be limited to, evening school, summer school, community college courses, adult education, preparation courses for high school equivalency testing, vocational training, work experience, programs to enhance self concept and parenting courses. School districts which are awarded grants pursuant to this Section shall be authorized to provide day care services to children of students who are eligible and desire to enroll in programs established and funded under this Section, but only if and to the extent that such day care is necessary to enable those eligible students to attend and participate in the programs and courses which are conducted pursuant to this Section. School districts and regional offices of education may claim general State aid under Section 18-8.05 or evidence-based funding under Section 18-8.15 for students enrolled in truants' alternative and optional education programs, provided that such students are receiving services that are supplemental to a program leading to a high school diploma and are otherwise eligible to be claimed for general State aid under Section 18-8.05 or evidence-based funding under Section 18-8.15, as applicable.

Such program, if established as authorized by this Section shall be designed to provide career related classroom instruction and cooperative work experience for 14 and 15 year old potential dropouts who are full time students in the regular school program. Participation in any work experience and career exploration program established under this Section shall provide school credit for successful completion of the class and paid work experience. The purpose of the program shall be to help academically disadvantaged students with the following special services: (1) basic education development and enrichment leading to improved self-image; (2) career education coupled with work training experiences, not exceeding 23 hours per week, provided by the private sector; and (3) motivation leading to continuation in school after age 16.
    The State Board of Education is authorized to fund school district work experience and career exploration programs, with priority being given to those school districts which have annual dropout rate data and unemployment rates greater than the Statewide average for the previous year.
    Funds for a work experience and career exploration program established under this Section shall be distributed to eligible school districts based on relative ability to pay factors and upon the number of economically disadvantaged students (E.C.I.A.

The State Board of Education shall promulgate rules and regulations necessary for implementation and continuation of any work experience and career exploration program established as authorized by this Section.
    From funds distributed for purposes of this Section, the State Board of Education is authorized to approve applications from qualifying school districts to help meet each such district's costs of employing teacher coordinators, teacher coordinators' travel expenses, student transportation costs and added training costs to employers.
    Each person employed as a teacher coordinator pursuant to this Section shall possess one year (2,000 hours) of employment in an occupation or occupations directly related to those career or employment areas with respect to which classroom instruction or cooperative work experience is to be provided under the program, and 6 semester hours of formal coursework in the area of organization and administration of work experience and career exploration education, including techniques of coordinating on-the-job experiences and individualized instructional methodology.
    Each work experience and career exploration program shall be limited to a minimum of 12 students and a maximum of 25 students per full-time teacher coordinator. Student limitation is based on the need for individual instruction and supervision time equivalent to one-half hour or more per week per student. Also, each qualified teacher coordinator shall be required to provide a minimum of 200 minutes of instruction per week on general and specific topics related to careers and employment.
    School district applications for participation in a work experience and career exploration program established under this Section shall be approved by the State Board of Education.

    Sec. 2-3.66b. IHOPE Program.
    (a) There is established the Illinois Hope and Opportunity Pathways through Education (IHOPE) Program. The State Board of Education shall implement and administer the IHOPE Program. The goal of the IHOPE Program is to develop a comprehensive system in this State to re-enroll significant numbers of high school dropouts in programs that will enable them to earn their high school diploma.
    (b) The IHOPE Program shall award grants, subject to appropriation for this purpose, to educational service regions and a school district organized under Article 34 of this Code from appropriated funds to assist in establishing instructional programs and other services designed to re-enroll high school dropouts. From any funds appropriated for the IHOPE Program, the State Board of Education may use up to 5% for administrative costs, including the performance of a program evaluation and the hiring of staff to implement and administer the program.
    The IHOPE Program shall provide incentive grant funds for regional offices of education and a school district organized under Article 34 of this Code to develop partnerships with school districts, public community colleges, and community groups to build comprehensive plans to re-enroll high school dropouts in their regions or districts.
    Programs funded through the IHOPE Program shall allow high school dropouts, up to and including age 21 notwithstanding Section 26-2 of this Code, to re-enroll in an educational program in conformance with rules adopted by the State Board of Education. Programs may include without limitation comprehensive year-round programming, evening school, summer school, community college courses, adult education, vocational training, work experience, programs to enhance self-concept, and parenting courses. Any student in the IHOPE Program who wishes to earn a high school diploma must meet the prerequisites to receiving a high school diploma specified in Section 27-22 of this Code and any other graduation requirements of the student's district of residence. Any student who successfully completes the requirements for his or her graduation shall receive a diploma identifying the student as graduating from his or her district of residence.
    (c) In order to be eligible for funding under the IHOPE Program, an interested regional office of education or a school district organized under Article 34 of this Code shall develop an IHOPE Plan to be approved by the State Board of Education. The State Board of Education shall develop rules for the IHOPE Program that shall set forth the requirements for the development of the IHOPE Plan. Each Plan shall involve school districts, public community colleges, and key community programs that work with high school dropouts located in an educational service region or the City of Chicago before the Plan is sent to the State Board for approval. No funds may be distributed to a regional office of education or a school district organized under Article 34 of this Code until the State Board has approved the Plan.
    (d) A regional office of education or a school district organized under Article 34 of this Code may operate its own program funded by the IHOPE Program or enter into a contract with other not-for-profit entities, including school districts, public community colleges, and not-for-profit community-based organizations, to operate a program.
    A regional office of education or a school district organized under Article 34 of this Code that receives an IHOPE grant from the State Board of Education may provide funds under a sub-grant, as specified in the IHOPE Plan, to other not-for-profit entities to provide services according to the IHOPE Plan that was developed. These other entities may include school districts, public community colleges, or not-for-profit community-based organizations or a cooperative partnership among these entities.
    (e) In order to distribute funding based upon the need to ensure delivery of programs that will have the greatest impact, IHOPE Program funding must be distributed based upon the proportion of dropouts in the educational service region or school district, in the case of a school district organized under Article 34 of this Code, to the total number of dropouts in this State. This formula shall employ the dropout data provided by school districts to the State Board of Education.
    A regional office of education or a school district organized under Article 34 of this Code may claim State aid under Section 18-8.05 or 18-8.15 of this Code for students enrolled in a program funded by the IHOPE Program, provided that the State Board of Education has approved the IHOPE Plan and that these students are receiving services that are meeting the requirements of Section 27-22 of this Code for receipt of a high school diploma and are otherwise eligible to be claimed for general State aid under Section 18-8.05 of this Code or evidence-based funding under Section 18-8.15 of this Code, including provisions related to the minimum number of days of pupil attendance pursuant to Section 10-19 of this Code and the minimum number of daily hours of school work required under Section 10-19.05 and any exceptions thereto as defined by the State Board of Education in rules.
    (f) IHOPE categories of programming may include the following:
        (1) Full-time programs that are comprehensive,
    	
year-round programs.
        (2) Part-time programs combining work and study
    	
scheduled at various times that are flexible to the needs of students.
        (3) Online programs and courses in which students
    	
take courses and complete on-site, supervised tests that measure the student's mastery of a specific course needed for graduation. Students may take courses online and earn credit or students may prepare to take supervised tests for specific courses for credit leading to receipt of a high school diploma.
        (4) Dual enrollment in which students attend high
    	
school classes in combination with community college classes or students attend community college classes while simultaneously earning high school credit and eventually a high school diploma.
    (g) In order to have successful comprehensive programs re-enrolling and graduating low-skilled high school dropouts, programs funded through the IHOPE Program shall include all of the following components:
        (1) Small programs (70 to 100 students) at a
    	
separate school site with a distinct identity. Programs may be larger with specific need and justification, keeping in mind that it is crucial to keep programs small to be effective.
        (2) Specific performance-based goals and outcomes
    	
and measures of enrollment, attendance, skills, credits, graduation, and the transition to college, training, and employment.
        (3) Strong, experienced leadership and teaching
    	
staff who are provided with ongoing professional development.
        (4) Voluntary enrollment.
        (5) High standards for student learning, integrating
    	
work experience, and education, including during the school year and after school, and summer school programs that link internships, work, and learning.
        (6) Comprehensive programs providing extensive
    	
support services.
        (7) Small teams of students supported by full-time
    	
paid mentors who work to retain and help those students graduate.
        (8) A comprehensive technology learning center with
    	
Internet access and broad-based curriculum focusing on academic and career subject areas.
        (9) Learning opportunities that incorporate action
    	
into study.
    (h) Programs funded through the IHOPE Program must report data to the State Board of Education as requested. This information shall include, but is not limited to, student enrollment figures, attendance information, course completion data, graduation information, and post-graduation information, as available.
    (i) Rules must be developed by the State Board of Education to set forth the fund distribution process to regional offices of education and a school district organized under Article 34 of this Code, the planning and the conditions upon which an IHOPE Plan would be approved by State Board, and other rules to develop the IHOPE Program.

    Sec. 2-3.71. Grants for preschool educational programs.
    (a) Preschool program.
        (1) The State Board of Education shall implement and
    	
administer a grant program under the provisions of this subsection which shall consist of grants to public school districts and other eligible entities, as defined by the State Board of Education, to conduct voluntary preschool educational programs for children ages 3 to 5 which include a parent education component. A public school district which receives grants under this subsection may subcontract with other entities that are eligible to conduct a preschool educational program. These grants must be used to supplement, not supplant, funds received from any other source.
        (2) (Blank).
        (3) Except as otherwise provided under this
    	
subsection (a), any teacher of preschool children in the program authorized by this subsection shall hold a Professional Educator License with an early childhood education endorsement.
        (3.5) Beginning with the 2018-2019 school year and
    	
until the 2023-2024 school year, an individual may teach preschool children in an early childhood program under this Section if he or she holds a Professional Educator License with an early childhood education endorsement or with short-term approval for early childhood education or he or she pursues a Professional Educator License and holds any of the following:
            (A) An ECE Credential Level of 5 awarded by the
        	
Department of Human Services under the Gateways to Opportunity Program developed under Section 10-70 of the Department of Human Services Act.
            (B) An Educator License with Stipulations with a
        	
transitional bilingual educator endorsement and he or she has (i) passed an early childhood education content test or (ii) completed no less than 9 semester hours of postsecondary coursework in the area of early childhood education.
        (4) (Blank).
        (4.5) The State Board of Education shall provide the
    	
primary source of funding through appropriations for the program. Such funds shall be distributed to achieve a goal of "Preschool for All Children" for the benefit of all children whose families choose to participate in the program. Based on available appropriations, newly funded programs shall be selected through a process giving first priority to qualified programs serving primarily at-risk children and second priority to qualified programs serving primarily children with a family income of less than 4 times the poverty guidelines updated periodically in the Federal Register by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services under the authority of 42 U.S.C. 9902(2). For purposes of this paragraph (4.5), at-risk children are those who because of their home and community environment are subject to such language, cultural, economic and like disadvantages to cause them to have been determined as a result of screening procedures to be at risk of academic failure. Such screening procedures shall be based on criteria established by the State Board of Education.
        Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (4.5),
    	
grantees under the program must enter into a memorandum of understanding with the appropriate local Head Start agency. This memorandum must be entered into no later than 3 months after the award of a grantee's grant under the program, except that, in the case of the 2009-2010 program year, the memorandum must be entered into no later than the deadline set by the State Board of Education for applications to participate in the program in fiscal year 2011, and must address collaboration between the grantee's program and the local Head Start agency on certain issues, which shall include without limitation the following:
            (A) educational activities, curricular
        	
objectives, and instruction;
            (B) public information dissemination and access
        	
to programs for families contacting programs;
            (C) service areas;
            (D) selection priorities for eligible children to
        	
be served by programs;
            (E) maximizing the impact of federal and State
        	
funding to benefit young children;
            (F) staff training, including opportunities for
        	
joint staff training;
            (G) technical assistance;
            (H) communication and parent outreach for smooth
        	
transitions to kindergarten;
            (I) provision and use of facilities,
        	
transportation, and other program elements;
            (J) facilitating each program's fulfillment of
        	
its statutory and regulatory requirements;
            (K) improving local planning and collaboration;
        	
and
            (L) providing comprehensive services for the
        	
neediest Illinois children and families.
    If the appropriate local Head Start agency is unable or
    	
unwilling to enter into a memorandum of understanding as required under this paragraph (4.5), the memorandum of understanding requirement shall not apply and the grantee under the program must notify the State Board of Education in writing of the Head Start agency's inability or unwillingness. The State Board of Education shall compile all such written notices and make them available to the public.
        (5) The State Board of Education shall develop and
    	
provide evaluation tools, including tests, that school districts and other eligible entities may use to evaluate children for school readiness prior to age 5. The State Board of Education shall require school districts and other eligible entities to obtain consent from the parents or guardians of children before any evaluations are conducted. The State Board of Education shall encourage local school districts and other eligible entities to evaluate the population of preschool children in their communities and provide preschool programs, pursuant to this subsection, where appropriate.
        (6) The State Board of Education shall report to the
    	
General Assembly by November 1, 2018 and every 2 years thereafter on the results and progress of students who were enrolled in preschool educational programs, including an assessment of which programs have been most successful in promoting academic excellence and alleviating academic failure. The State Board of Education shall assess the academic progress of all students who have been enrolled in preschool educational programs.
        On or before November 1 of each fiscal year in which
    	
the General Assembly provides funding for new programs under paragraph (4.5) of this Section, the State Board of Education shall report to the General Assembly on what percentage of new funding was provided to programs serving primarily at-risk children, what percentage of new funding was provided to programs serving primarily children with a family income of less than 4 times the federal poverty level, and what percentage of new funding was provided to other programs.
        (7) Due to evidence that expulsion practices in the
    	
preschool years are linked to poor child outcomes and are employed inconsistently across racial and gender groups, early childhood programs receiving State funds under this subsection (a) shall prohibit expulsions. Planned transitions to settings that are able to better meet a child's needs are not considered expulsion under this paragraph (7).
            (A) When persistent and serious challenging
        	
behaviors emerge, the early childhood program shall document steps taken to ensure that the child can participate safely in the program; including observations of initial and ongoing challenging behaviors, strategies for remediation and intervention plans to address the behaviors, and communication with the parent or legal guardian, including participation of the parent or legal guardian in planning and decision-making.
            (B) The early childhood program shall, with
        	
parental or legal guardian consent as required, utilize a range of community resources, if available and deemed necessary, including, but not limited to, developmental screenings, referrals to programs and services administered by a local educational agency or early intervention agency under Parts B and C of the federal Individual with Disabilities Education Act, and consultation with infant and early childhood mental health consultants and the child's health care provider. The program shall document attempts to engage these resources, including parent or legal guardian participation and consent attempted and obtained. Communication with the parent or legal guardian shall take place in a culturally and linguistically competent manner.
            (C) If there is documented evidence that all
        	
available interventions and supports recommended by a qualified professional have been exhausted and the program determines in its professional judgment that transitioning a child to another program is necessary for the well-being of the child or his or her peers and staff, with parent or legal guardian permission, both the current and pending programs shall create a transition plan designed to ensure continuity of services and the comprehensive development of the child. Communication with families shall occur in a culturally and linguistically competent manner.
            (D) Nothing in this paragraph (7) shall preclude
        	
a parent's or legal guardian's right to voluntarily withdraw his or her child from an early childhood program. Early childhood programs shall request and keep on file, when received, a written statement from the parent or legal guardian stating the reason for his or her decision to withdraw his or her child.
            (E) In the case of the determination of a serious
        	
safety threat to a child or others or in the case of behaviors listed in subsection (d) of Section 10-22.6 of this Code, the temporary removal of a child from attendance in group settings may be used. Temporary removal of a child from attendance in a group setting shall trigger the process detailed in subparagraphs (A), (B), and (C) of this paragraph (7), with the child placed back in a group setting as quickly as possible.
            (F) Early childhood programs may utilize and the
        	
State Board of Education, the Department of Human Services, and the Department of Children and Family Services shall recommend training, technical support, and professional development resources to improve the ability of teachers, administrators, program directors, and other staff to promote social-emotional development and behavioral health, to address challenging behaviors, and to understand trauma and trauma-informed care, cultural competence, family engagement with diverse populations, the impact of implicit bias on adult behavior, and the use of reflective practice techniques. Support shall include the availability of resources to contract with infant and early childhood mental health consultants.
            (G) Beginning on July 1, 2018, early childhood
        	
programs shall annually report to the State Board of Education, and, beginning in fiscal year 2020, the State Board of Education shall make available on a biennial basis, in an existing report, all of the following data for children from birth to age 5 who are served by the program:
                (i) Total number served over the course of
            	
the program year and the total number of children who left the program during the program year.
                (ii) Number of planned transitions to another
            	
program due to children's behavior, by children's race, gender, disability, language, class/group size, teacher-child ratio, and length of program day.
                (iii) Number of temporary removals of a child
            	
from attendance in group settings due to a serious safety threat under subparagraph (E) of this paragraph (7), by children's race, gender, disability, language, class/group size, teacher-child ratio, and length of program day.
                (iv) Hours of infant and early childhood
            	
mental health consultant contact with program leaders, staff, and families over the program year.
            (H) Changes to services for children with an
        	
individualized education program or individual family service plan shall be construed in a manner consistent with the federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act.
        The State Board of Education, in consultation with
    	
the Governor's Office of Early Childhood Development and the Department of Children and Family Services, shall adopt rules to administer this paragraph (7).
    (b) (Blank).
    (c) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Section, grantees may serve children ages 0 to 12 of essential workers if the Governor has declared a disaster due to a public health emergency pursuant to Section 7 of the Illinois Emergency Management Agency Act. For the purposes of this subsection, essential workers include those outlined in Executive Order 20-8 and school employees. The State Board of Education shall adopt rules to administer this subsection.

    (b) The Board shall annually award funds through a grant approval process established by the State Board of Education, providing that an annual appropriation is made for this purpose from State, federal or private funds. Nothing in this Section shall preclude school districts from applying for or accepting private funds to establish and implement programs.
    (c) The State Board of Education shall assist those districts and other eligible entities offering early childhood parental training programs, upon request, in developing instructional materials, training teachers and staff, and establishing appropriate time allotments for each of the areas included in such instruction.
    (d) School districts and other eligible entities may offer early childhood parental training courses during that period of the day which is not part of the regular school day.

    (a) The State Board of Education may distribute loan or grant moneys appropriated for temporary relocation expenses incurred by school districts as a result of fires, earthquakes, tornados, mine subsidence, or other natural or man-made disasters which destroy school buildings, or as a result of the condemnation of a school building under Section 3-14.22. The State Board of Education shall by rule prescribe those expenses which qualify as temporary relocation expenses and the manner of determining and reporting the same, provided that such expenses shall be deemed to include amounts reasonably required to be expended for the lease, rental, and renovation of educational facilities and for additional transportation and other expenses directly associated with the temporary relocation and housing of the normal operations, activities, and affairs of a school district.
    (b) Except as provided in subsection (c), no moneys appropriated to the State Board of Education for purposes of distribution in accordance with the provisions of this Section shall be distributed to any school district unless the school board of such district, as an express condition of any such distribution, agrees to levy the tax provided for by Section 17-2.2c at the maximum rate permitted thereunder and to pay to the State of Illinois for deposit in the Temporary Relocation Expenses Revolving Grant Fund (i) all proceeds of such tax attributable to the first year and succeeding years for which the tax is levied after moneys appropriated for purposes of this Section have been distributed to the school district, and (ii) all insurance proceeds which become payable to the district under those provisions of any contract or policy of insurance which provide reimbursement for or other coverage against loss with respect to any temporary relocation expenses of the school district; provided, that the aggregate of any tax and insurance proceeds paid by the school district to the State pursuant to this Section shall not exceed in amount the moneys distributed to the school district pursuant to this Section.
    (c) The State Board of Education may, from appropriations made for this purpose from the Temporary Relocation Expenses Revolving Grant Fund, make grants that do not require repayment to school districts that qualify for temporary relocation assistance under this Section to the extent that the amount of temporary relocation expenses incurred by a district exceeds the amount that the district is able to repay to the State through insurance proceeds and the tax levy authorized in Section 17-2.2c.
    (d) The Temporary Relocation Expenses Revolving Grant Fund is hereby established as a special fund within the State treasury.

(a) The General Assembly recognizes that agriculture is the most basic and singularly important industry in the State, that agriculture is of central importance to the welfare and economic stability of the State, and that the maintenance of this vital industry requires a continued source of trained and qualified individuals for employment in agriculture and agribusiness. The General Assembly hereby declares that it is in the best interests of the people of the State of Illinois that a comprehensive education program in agriculture be created and maintained by the State's public school system in order to ensure an adequate supply of trained and skilled individuals and to ensure appropriate representation of racial and ethnic groups in all phases of the industry. It is the intent of the General Assembly that a State program for agricultural education shall be a part of the curriculum of the public school system K through adult, and made readily available to all school districts which may, at their option, include programs in education in agriculture as a part of the curriculum of that district.
    (b) The State Board of Education shall adopt such rules and regulations as are necessary to implement the provisions of this Section. The rules and regulations shall not create any new State mandates on school districts as a condition of receiving federal, State, and local funds by those entities. It is in the intent of the General Assembly that, although this Section does not create any new mandates, school districts are strongly advised to follow the guidelines set forth in this Section.
    (c) The State Superintendent of Education shall assume responsibility for the administration of the State program adopted under this Section throughout the public school system as well as the articulation of the State program to the requirements and mandates of federally assisted education. There is currently within the State Board of Education an agricultural education unit to assist school districts in the establishment and maintenance of educational programs pursuant to the provisions of this Section. The staffing of the unit shall at all times be comprised of an appropriate number of full-time employees who shall serve as program consultants in agricultural education and shall be available to provide assistance to school districts. At least one consultant shall be responsible for the coordination of the State program, as Head Consultant. At least one consultant shall be responsible for the coordination of the activities of student and agricultural organizations and associations.
    (d) A committee of 13 agriculturalists representative of the various and diverse areas of the agricultural industry in Illinois shall be established to at least develop a curriculum and overview the implementation of the Build Illinois through Quality Agricultural Education plans of the Illinois Leadership Council for Agricultural Education and to advise the State Board of Education on vocational agricultural education. The Committee shall be composed of the following: (6) agriculturalists representing the Illinois Leadership Council for Agricultural Education; (2) Secondary Agriculture Teachers; (1) "Ag In The Classroom" Teacher; (1) Community College Agriculture Teacher; (1) Adult Agriculture Education Teacher; (1) University Agriculture Teacher Educator; and (1) FFA Representative. All members of the Committee shall be appointed by the Governor by and with the advice and consent of the Senate. The terms of all members so appointed shall be for 3 years, except that of the members initially appointed, 5 shall be appointed to serve for terms of 1 year, 4 shall be appointed to serve for terms of 2 years and 4 shall be appointed to serve for terms of 3 years. All members of the Committee shall serve until their successors are appointed and qualified. Vacancies in terms shall be filled by appointment of the Governor with the advice and consent of the Senate for the extent of the unexpired term. The State Board of Education shall implement a Build Illinois through Quality Agricultural Education plan following receipt of these recommendations which shall be made available on or before March 31, 1987. Recommendations shall include, but not be limited to, the development of a curriculum and a strategy for the purpose of establishing a source of trained and qualified individuals in agriculture, a strategy for articulating the State program in agricultural education throughout the public school system, and a consumer education outreach strategy regarding the importance of agriculture in Illinois. The committee of agriculturalists shall serve without compensation.
    (e) A school district that offers a secondary agricultural education program that is approved for State and federal funding must ensure that, at a minimum, all of the following are available to its secondary agricultural education students:
        (1) An instructional sequence of courses approved by
    	
the State Board of Education.
        (2) A State and nationally affiliated FFA (Future
    	
Farmers of America) chapter that is integral to instruction and is not treated solely as an extracurricular activity.
        (3) A mechanism for ensuring the involvement of all
    	
secondary agricultural education students in formal, supervised, agricultural-experience activities and programs.
    (f) Nothing in this Section may prevent those secondary agricultural education programs that are in operation before the effective date of this amendatory Act of the 94th General Assembly and that do not have an active State and nationally affiliated FFA chapter from continuing to operate or from continuing to receive funding from the State Board of Education.

    Sec. 2-3.152. Community schools.
    (a) This Section applies beginning with the 2009-2010 school year.
    (b) The General Assembly finds all of the following:
        (1) All children are capable of success.
        (2) Schools are the centers of vibrant communities.
        (3) Strong families build strong educational
    	
communities.
        (4) Children succeed when adults work together to
    	
foster positive educational outcomes.
        (5) Schools work best when families take active roles
    	
in the education of children.
        (6) Schools today are limited in their ability to
    	
dedicate time and resources to provide a wide range of educational opportunities to students because of the focus on standardized test outcomes.
        (7) By providing learning opportunities outside of
    	
normal school hours, including programs on life skills and health, students are more successful academically, more engaged in their communities, safer, and better prepared to make a successful transition from school to adulthood.
        (8) A community school is a traditional school that
    	
actively partners with its community to leverage existing resources and identify new resources to support the transformation of the school to provide enrichment and additional life skill opportunities for students, parents, and community members at-large. Each community school is unique because its programming is designed by and for the school staff, in partnership with parents, community stakeholders, and students.
        (9) Community schools currently exist in this State
    	
in urban, rural, and suburban communities.
        (10) Research shows that community schools have a
    	
powerful positive impact on students, as demonstrated by increased academic success, a positive change in attitudes toward school and learning, and decreased behavioral problems.
        (11) After-school and evening programs offered by
    	
community schools provide academic enrichment consistent with the Illinois Learning Standards and general school curriculum; an opportunity for physical fitness activities for students, fine arts programs, structured learning "play" time, and other recreational opportunities; a safe haven for students; and work supports for working families.
        (12) Community schools are cost-effective because
    	
they leverage existing resources provided by local, State, federal, and private sources and bring programs to the schools, where the students are already congregated. Community schools have been shown to leverage between $5 to $8 in existing programming for every $1 spent on a community school.
    (c) Subject to an appropriation or the availability of funding for such purposes, the State Board of Education shall make grants available to fund community schools and to enhance programs at community schools. A request-for-proposal process must be used in awarding grants under this subsection (c). Proposals may be submitted on behalf of a school, a school district, or a consortium of 2 or more schools or school districts. Proposals must be evaluated and scored on the basis of criteria consistent with this Section and other factors developed and adopted by the State Board of Education. Technical assistance in grant writing must be made available to schools, school districts, or consortia of school districts through the State Board of Education directly or through a resource and referral directory established and maintained by the State Board of Education.
    (d) In order to qualify for a community school grant under this Section, a school must, at a minimum, have the following components:
        (1) Before and after-school programming each school
    	
day to meet the identified needs of students.
        (2) Weekend programming.
        (3) At least 4 weeks of summer programming.
        (4) A local advisory group comprised of school
    	
leadership, parents, and community stakeholders that establishes school-specific programming goals, assesses program needs, and oversees the process of implementing expanded programming.
        (5) A program director or resource coordinator who is
    	
responsible for establishing a local advisory group, assessing the needs of students and community members, identifying programs to meet those needs, developing the before and after-school, weekend, and summer programming and overseeing the implementation of programming to ensure high quality, efficiency, and robust participation.
        (6) Programming that includes academic excellence
    	
aligned with the Illinois Learning Standards, life skills, healthy minds and bodies, parental support, and community engagement and that promotes staying in school and non-violent behavior and non-violent conflict resolution.
        (7) Maintenance of attendance records in all
    	
programming components.
        (8) Maintenance of measurable data showing annual
    	
participation and the impact of programming on the participating children and adults.
        (9) Documentation of true collaboration between the
    	
school and community stakeholders, including local governmental units, civic organizations, families, businesses, and social service providers.
        (10) A non-discrimination policy ensuring that the
    	
community school does not condition participation upon race, ethnic origin, religion, sex, or disability.

Each school district shall annually administer the climate survey in every public school attendance center by a date specified by the State Superintendent of Education, and data resulting from the instrument's administration must be provided to the State Board of Education. The survey component that requires completion by the teachers must be administered during teacher meetings or professional development days or at other times that would not interfere with the teachers' regular classroom and direct instructional duties. The State Superintendent shall publicly report on the survey indicators of learning conditions resulting from administration of the instrument at the individual school, district, and State levels and shall identify whether the indicators result from an anonymous administration of the instrument.
    (b) A school district may elect to use, on a district-wide basis and at the school district's sole cost and expense, an alternate climate survey of learning conditions instrument pre-approved by the State Superintendent under subsection (c) of this Section in lieu of the State-adopted climate survey, provided that:
        (1) the school district notifies the State Board of
    	
Education, on a form provided by the State Superintendent, of its intent to administer an alternate climate survey on or before a date established by the State Superintendent for each school;
        (2) the notification submitted to the State Board
    	
under paragraph (1) of this subsection (b) must be accompanied by a certification signed by the president of the local teachers' exclusive bargaining representative and president of the school board indicating that the alternate survey has been agreed to by the teachers' exclusive bargaining representative and the school board;
        (3) the school district's administration of the
    	
alternate instrument, including providing to the State Board of Education data and reports suitable to be published on school report cards and the State School Report Card Internet website, is performed in accordance with the requirements of subsection (a) of this Section; and
        (4) the alternate instrument is administered each
    	
school year.
    (c) The State Superintendent, in consultation with teachers, principals, superintendents, and other appropriate stakeholders, shall administer an approval process through which at least 2, but not more than 3, alternate survey of learning conditions instruments will be approved by the State Superintendent following a determination by the State Superintendent that each approved instrument:
        (1) meets all requirements of subsection (a) of this
    	
Section;
        (2) provides a summation of indicator results of the
    	
alternative survey by a date established by the State Superintendent in a manner that allows the indicator results to be included on school report cards pursuant to Section 10-17a of this Code by October 31 of the school year following the instrument's administration;
        (3) provides summary reports for each district and
    	
attendance center intended for parents and community stakeholders;
        (4) meets scale reliability requirements using
    	
accepted testing measures;
        (5) provides research-based evidence linking
    	
instrument content to one or more improved student outcomes; and
        (6) has undergone and documented testing to prove
    	
validity and reliability.
The State Superintendent shall periodically review and update the list of approved alternate survey instruments, provided that at least 2, but no more than 3, alternate survey instruments shall be approved for use during any school year.

        (1) guidelines for teachers and parents or guardians
    	
on how to identify signs of dyslexia;
        (2) a description of educational strategies that have
    	
been shown to improve the academic performance of pupils with dyslexia; and
        (3) a description of resources and services available
    	
to pupils with dyslexia, parents or guardians of pupils with dyslexia, and teachers.

    (a) On or before October 31, 2015 and on or before October 31 of each subsequent year, the State Board of Education, through the State Superintendent of Education, shall prepare a report on student discipline in all school districts in this State, including State-authorized charter schools. This report shall include data from all public schools within school districts, including district-authorized charter schools. This report must be posted on the Internet website of the State Board of Education. The report shall include data on the issuance of out-of-school suspensions, expulsions, and removals to alternative settings in lieu of another disciplinary action, disaggregated by race and ethnicity, gender, age, grade level, whether a student is an English learner, incident type, and discipline duration.
    (b) The State Board of Education shall analyze the data under subsection (a) of this Section on an annual basis and determine the top 20% of school districts for the following metrics:
        (1) Total number of out-of-school suspensions divided
    	
by the total district enrollment by the last school day in September for the year in which the data was collected, multiplied by 100.
        (2) Total number of out-of-school expulsions divided
    	
by the total district enrollment by the last school day in September for the year in which the data was collected, multiplied by 100.
        (3) Racial disproportionality, defined as the
    	
overrepresentation of students of color or white students in comparison to the total number of students of color or white students on October 1st of the school year in which data are collected, with respect to the use of out-of-school suspensions and expulsions, which must be calculated using the same method as the U.S. Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights uses.
    The analysis must be based on data collected over 3 consecutive school years, beginning with the 2014-2015 school year.
    Beginning with the 2017-2018 school year, the State Board of Education shall require each of the school districts that are identified in the top 20% of any of the metrics described in this subsection (b) for 3 consecutive years to submit a plan identifying the strategies the school district will implement to reduce the use of exclusionary disciplinary practices or racial disproportionality or both, if applicable. School districts that no longer meet the criteria described in any of the metrics described in this subsection (b) for 3 consecutive years shall no longer be required to submit a plan.
    This plan may be combined with any other improvement plans required under federal or State law.
    The calculation of the top 20% of any of the metrics described in this subsection (b) shall exclude all school districts, State-authorized charter schools, and special charter districts that issued fewer than a total of 10 out-of-school suspensions or expulsions, whichever is applicable, during the school year. The calculation of the top 20% of the metric described in subdivision (3) of this subsection (b) shall exclude all school districts with an enrollment of fewer than 50 white students or fewer than 50 students of color.
    The plan must be approved at a public school board meeting and posted on the school district's Internet website. Within one year after being identified, the school district shall submit to the State Board of Education and post on the district's Internet website a progress report describing the implementation of the plan and the results achieved.

    (105 ILCS 5/2-3.170)
    Sec. 2-3.170. Property tax relief pool grants.
    (a) As used in this Section,
    "EAV" means equalized assessed valuation as defined under Section 18-8.15 of this Code.
    "Property tax multiplier" equals one minus the square of the school district's Local Capacity Percentage, as defined in Section 18-8.15 of this Code.
    "Local capacity percentage multiplier" means one minus the school district's Local Capacity Percentage, as defined in Section 18-8.15.
    "State Board" means the State Board of Education.
    (b) Subject to appropriation, the State Board shall provide grants to eligible school districts that provide tax relief to the school district's residents, which may be no greater than 1% of EAV for a unit district, 0.69% of EAV for an elementary school district, or 0.31% of EAV for a high school district, as provided in this Section.
    (b-5) School districts may apply for property tax relief under this Section concurrently to setting their levy for the fiscal year. The intended relief may not be greater than 1% of the EAV for a unit district, 0.69% of the EAV for an elementary school district, or 0.31% of the EAV for a high school district, multiplied by the school district's local capacity percentage multiplier. The State Board shall process applications for relief, providing a grant to those districts with the highest operating tax rate, as determined by those districts with the highest percentage of the simple average operating tax rate of districts of the same type, either elementary, high school, or unit, first, in an amount equal to the intended relief multiplied by the property tax multiplier. The State Board shall provide grants to school districts in order of priority until the property tax relief pool is exhausted. If more school districts apply for relief under this subsection than there are funds available, the State Board must distribute the grants and prorate any remaining funds to the final school district that qualifies for grant relief. The abatement amount for that district must be equal to the grant amount divided by the property tax multiplier.
    If a school district receives the State Board's approval of a grant under this Section by March 1 of the fiscal year, the school district shall present a duly authorized and approved abatement resolution by March 30 of the fiscal year to the county clerk of each county in which the school files its levy, authorizing the county clerk to lower the school district's levy by the amount designated in its application to the State Board. When the preceding requisites are satisfied, the county clerk shall reduce the amount collected for the school district by the amount indicated in the school district's abatement resolution for that fiscal year.
    (c) (Blank).
    (d) School districts seeking grants under this Section shall apply to the State Board each year. All applications to the State Board for grants shall include the amount of the tax relief intended by the school district.
    (e) Each year, based on the most recent available data provided by school districts pursuant to Section 18-8.15 of this Code, the State Board shall calculate the order of priority for grant eligibility under subsection (b-5) and publish a list of the school districts eligible for relief. The State Board shall provide grants in the manner provided under subsection (b-5).
    (f) The State Board shall publish a final list of eligible grant recipients and provide payment of the grants by March 1 of each year.
    (g) If notice of eligibility from the State Board is received by a school district by March 1, then by March 30, the school district shall file an abatement of its property tax levy in an amount equal to the grant received under this Section divided by the property tax multiplier. Payment of all grant amounts shall be made by June 1 each fiscal year. The State Superintendent of Education shall establish the timeline in such cases in which notice cannot be made by March 1.
    (h) The total property tax relief allowable to a school district under this Section shall be calculated based on the total amount of reduction in the school district's aggregate extension. The total grant shall be equal to the reduction, multiplied by the property tax multiplier. The reduction shall be equal to 1% of a district's EAV for a unit school district, 0.69% for an elementary school district, or 0.31% for a high school district, multiplied by the school district's local capacity percentage multiplier.
    (i) If the State Board does not expend all appropriations allocated pursuant to this Section, then any remaining funds shall be allocated pursuant to Section 18-8.15 of this Code.
    (j) The State Board shall prioritize payments under Section 18-8.15 of this Code over payments under this Section, if necessary.
    (k) Any grants received by a school district shall be included in future calculations of that school district's Base Funding Minimum under Section 18-8.15 of this Code. Beginning with Fiscal Year 2020, if a school district receives a grant under this Section, the school district must present to the county clerk a duly authorized and approved abatement resolution by March 30 for the year in which the school district receives the grant and the successive fiscal year following the receipt of the grant, authorizing the county clerk to lower the school district's levy by the amount designated in its original application to the State Board. After receiving a resolution, the county clerk must reduce the amount collected for the school district by the amount indicated in the school district's abatement resolution for that fiscal year. If a school district does not abate in this amount for the successive fiscal year, the grant amount may not be included in the school district's Base Funding Minimum under Section 18-8.15 in the fiscal year following the tax year in which the abatement is not authorized and in any future fiscal year thereafter, and the county clerk must notify the State Board of the increase no later 30 days after it occurs.
    (l) In the immediate 2 consecutive tax years following receipt of a Property Tax Pool Relief Grant, the aggregate extension base of any school district receiving a grant under this Section, for purposes of the Property Tax Extension Limitation Law, shall include the tax relief the school district provided in the previous taxable year under this Section.

    (a) In this Section, "recruiting firm" means a company with expertise in finding qualified applicants for positions and screening those potential workers for an employer.
    (b) By January 1, 2019, the State Board of Education shall implement a program and adopt rules to allow school districts to supplement their substitute teacher recruitment for elementary and secondary schools with the use of recruiting firms, subject to the other provisions of this Section. To qualify for the program, a school district shall demonstrate to the State Board that, because of the severity of its substitute teacher shortage, it is unable to find an adequate amount of substitute or retired teachers and has exhausted all other efforts.

    Sec. 2-3.186. Freedom Schools; grant program.
    (a) The General Assembly recognizes and values the contributions that Freedom Schools make to enhance the lives of Black students. The General Assembly makes all of the following findings:
        (1) The fundamental goal of the Freedom Schools of
    	
the 1960s was to provide quality education for all students, to motivate active civic engagement, and to empower disenfranchised communities. The renowned and progressive curriculum of Freedom Schools allowed students of all ages to experience a new and liberating form of education that directly related to the imperatives of their lives, their communities, and the Freedom Movement.
        (2) Freedom Schools continue to demonstrate the
    	
proven benefits of critical civic engagement and intergenerational effects by providing historically disadvantaged students, including African American students and other students of color, with quality instruction that fosters student confidence, critical thinking, and social and emotional development.
        (3) Freedom Schools offer culturally relevant
    	
learning opportunities with the academic and social supports that Black children need by utilizing quality teaching, challenging and engaging curricula, wrap-around supports, a positive school climate, and strong ties to family and community. Freedom Schools have a clear focus on results.
        (4) Public schools serve a foundational role in the
    	
education of over 2,000,000 students in this State.
    (b) The State Board of Education shall establish a Freedom School network to supplement the learning taking place in public schools by creating a 6-week summer program with an organization with a mission to improve the odds for children in poverty that operates Freedom Schools in multiple states using a research-based and multicultural curriculum for disenfranchised communities most affected by the opportunity gap and learning loss caused by the pandemic, and by expanding the teaching of African American history, developing leadership skills, and providing an understanding of the tenets of the civil rights movement. The teachers in Freedom Schools must be from the local community, with an emphasis on historically disadvantaged youth, including African American students and other students of color, so that (i) these individuals have access to summer jobs and teaching experiences that serve as a long-term pipeline to educational careers and the hiring of minority educators in public schools, (ii) these individuals are elevated as content experts and community leaders, and (iii) Freedom School students have access to both mentorship and equitable educational resources.
    (c) A Freedom School shall intentionally and imaginatively implement strategies that focus on all of the following:
        (1) Racial justice and equity.
        (2) Transparency and building trusting
    	
relationships.
        (3) Self-determination and governance.
        (4) Building on community strengths and community
    	
wisdom.
        (5) Utilizing current data, best practices, and
    	
evidence.
        (6) Shared leadership and collaboration.
        (7) A reflective learning culture.
        (8) A whole-child approach to education.
        (9) Literacy.
    (d) The State Board of Education, in the establishment of Freedom Schools, shall strive for authentic parent and community engagement during the development of Freedom Schools and their curriculum. Authentic parent and community engagement includes all of the following:
        (1) A shared responsibility that values equal
    	
partnerships between families and professionals.
        (2) Ensuring that students and families who are
    	
directly impacted by Freedom School policies and practices are the decision-makers in the creation, design, implementation, and assessment of those policies and practices.
        (3) Genuine respect for the culture and diversity
    	
of families.
        (4) Relationships that center around the goal of
    	
supporting family well-being and children's development and learning.
    (e) Subject to appropriation, the State Board of Education shall establish and implement a grant program to provide grants to public schools, public community colleges, and not-for-profit, community-based organizations to facilitate improved educational outcomes for Black students in grades pre-kindergarten through 12 in alignment with the integrity and practices of the Freedom School model established during the civil rights movement. Grant recipients under the program may include, but are not limited to, entities that work with the Children's Defense Fund or offer established programs with proven results and outcomes. The State Board of Education shall award grants to eligible entities that demonstrate a likelihood of reasonable success in achieving the goals identified in the grant application, including, but not limited to, all of the following:
        (1) Engaging, culturally relevant, and challenging
    	
curricula.
        (2) High-quality teaching.
        (3) Wrap-around supports and opportunities.
        (4) Positive discipline practices, such as
    	
restorative justice.
        (5) Inclusive leadership.
    (f) The Freedom Schools Fund is created as a special fund in the State treasury. the Fund shall consist of appropriations from the General Revenue Fund, grant funds from the federal government, and donations from educational and private foundations. All money in the Fund shall be used, subject to appropriation, by the State Board of Education for the purposes of this Section and to support related activities.
    (g) The State Board of Education may adopt any rules necessary to implement this Section.

    The salaries provided in this Section plus an amount for other employment-related compensation or benefits for regional superintendents and assistant regional superintendents are payable monthly by the State Board of Education out of the Personal Property Tax Replacement Fund through a specific appropriation to that effect in the State Board of Education budget. The State Comptroller in making his or her warrant to any county for the amount due it from the Personal Property Tax Replacement Fund shall deduct from it the several amounts for which warrants have been issued to the regional superintendent, and any assistant regional superintendent, of the educational service region encompassing the county since the preceding apportionment from the Personal Property Tax Replacement Fund.

For the purposes of calculating regional superintendent and assistant regional superintendent salaries for educational service centers established under Section 2-3.62 of this Code, populations shall be established by subtracting from the total county population the population of a city with 500,000 or more inhabitants, divided by the number of educational service centers in the county.

    Sec. 3-15.12. High school equivalency. The regional superintendent of schools and the Illinois Community College Board shall make available for qualified individuals residing within the region a High School Equivalency Testing Program and alternative methods of credentialing, as identified under this Section. For that purpose the regional superintendent alone or with other regional superintendents may establish and supervise a testing center or centers to administer the secure forms for high school equivalency testing to qualified persons. Such centers shall be under the supervision of the regional superintendent in whose region such centers are located, subject to the approval of the Executive Director of the Illinois Community College Board. The Illinois Community College Board shall also establish criteria and make available alternative methods of credentialing throughout the State.

For purposes of this Section, residence is that abode which the applicant considers his or her home. Applicants may provide as sufficient proof of such residence and as an acceptable form of identification a driver's license, valid passport, military ID, or other form of government-issued national or foreign identification that shows the applicant's name, address, date of birth, signature, and photograph or other acceptable identification as may be allowed by law or as regulated by the Illinois Community College Board. Such regional superintendent shall determine if the applicant meets statutory and regulatory state standards.
    If qualified the applicant shall at the time of such application pay a fee established by the Illinois Community College Board, which fee shall be paid into a special fund under the control and supervision of the regional superintendent. Such moneys received by the regional superintendent shall be used, first, for the expenses incurred in administering and scoring the examination, and next for other educational programs that are developed and designed by the regional superintendent of schools to assist those who successfully complete high school equivalency testing or meet the criteria for alternative methods of credentialing in furthering their academic development or their ability to secure and retain gainful employment, including programs for the competitive award based on test scores of college or adult education scholarship grants or similar educational incentives. Any excess moneys shall be paid into the institute fund.
    Any applicant who has achieved the minimum passing standards as established by the Illinois Community College Board shall be notified in writing by the regional superintendent and shall be issued a high school equivalency certificate on the forms provided by the Illinois Community College Board. The regional superintendent shall then certify to the Illinois Community College Board the score of the applicant and such other and additional information that may be required by the Illinois Community College Board. The moneys received therefrom shall be used in the same manner as provided for in this Section.
    The Illinois Community College Board shall establish alternative methods of credentialing for the issuance of high school equivalency certification. In addition to high school equivalency testing, the following alternative methods of receiving a high school equivalency credential shall be made available to qualified individuals on or after January 1, 2018:
        (A) High School Equivalency based on High School

Diploma. A qualified candidate may petition to have his or her foreign high school or post-secondary transcripts evaluated to determine what the candidate needs to meet criteria established by the Illinois Community College Board.
        (D) High School Equivalency based on Completion of a
    	
Competency-Based Program as approved by the Illinois Community College Board. The Illinois Community College Board shall establish guidelines for competency-based high school equivalency programs.
    Any applicant who has attained the age of 17 years and maintained residence in the State of Illinois and is not a high school graduate, any person who has enrolled in a youth education program sponsored by the Illinois National Guard, or any person who has successfully completed an alternative education program under Section 2-3.81, Article 13A, or Article 13B is eligible to apply for a high school equivalency certificate (if he or she meets the requirements prescribed by the Illinois Community College Board) upon showing evidence that he or she has completed, successfully, high school equivalency testing, administered by the United States Armed Forces Institute, official high school equivalency testing centers established in other states, Veterans' Administration Hospitals, or the office of the State Superintendent of Education for the Illinois State Penitentiary System and the Department of Corrections. Such applicant shall apply to the regional superintendent of the region wherein he or she has maintained residence, and, upon payment of a fee established by the Illinois Community College Board, the regional superintendent shall issue a high school equivalency certificate and immediately thereafter certify to the Illinois Community College Board the score of the applicant and such other and additional information as may be required by the Illinois Community College Board.
    Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section, any applicant who has been out of school for at least one year may request the regional superintendent of schools to administer restricted high school equivalency testing upon written request of: the director of a program who certifies to the Chief Examiner of an official high school equivalency testing center that the applicant has completed a program of instruction provided by such agencies as the Job Corps, the Postal Service Academy, or an apprenticeship training program; an employer or program director for purposes of entry into apprenticeship programs; another state's department of education in order to meet regulations established by that department of education; or a post high school educational institution for purposes of admission, the Department of Financial and Professional Regulation for licensing purposes, or the Armed Forces for induction purposes. The regional superintendent shall administer such testing, and the applicant shall be notified in writing that he or she is eligible to receive a high school equivalency certificate upon reaching age 17, provided he or she meets the standards established by the Illinois Community College Board.
    Any test administered under this Section to an applicant who does not speak and understand English may at the discretion of the administering agency be given and answered in any language in which the test is printed. The regional superintendent of schools may waive any fees required by this Section in case of hardship. The regional superintendent of schools and the Illinois Community College Board shall waive any fees required by this Section for an applicant who meets all of the following criteria:

        (4) The applicant has completed a high school
    	
equivalency preparation course through an Illinois Community College Board-approved provider.
        (5) The applicant is taking the test at a testing

Upon the adoption and passage of the resolution and the election or appointment by the school board of its own school treasurer commencing with the first day of the succeeding fiscal year, but not prior to July 1, 2019: (1) the trustees of schools in the township shall no longer have or exercise any powers or duties with respect to the school district or with respect to the school business, operations, or assets of the school district; (2) all books and records of the trustees of schools and all moneys, securities, loanable funds, and other assets relating to the school business and affairs of the school district shall be transferred and delivered to the school board, allowing for a reasonable period of time not to exceed 90 days to liquidate any pooled investments; and (3) all legal title to and all right, title, and interest formerly held by the trustees of schools in any common school lands, school buildings, or school sites used and occupied by the school board and all rights of property and causes of action pertaining to or constituting a part of the common school lands, buildings, or sites shall be deemed transferred by operation of law to and shall vest in the school board. The changes made to this Section by this amendatory Act of the 100th General Assembly are prospective only, starting from the effective date of this amendatory Act of the 100th General Assembly, and shall not affect any legal action pending on the effective date of this amendatory Act of the 100th General Assembly in the Illinois courts in which Lyons Township High School District 204 is a listed party.
    (c) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (a), the offices of township treasurer and trustee of schools of any township located in a Class II county school unit shall be abolished as provided in this subsection if all of the following conditions are met:
        (1) During the same 30 day period, each school board
    	
of each elementary and unit school district that is subject to the jurisdiction and authority of the township treasurer and trustees of schools of the township in which those offices are sought to be abolished gives written notice by certified mail, return receipt requested to the township treasurer and trustees of schools of that township of the date of a meeting of the school board, to be held not more than 90 nor less than 60 days after the date when the notice is given, at which meeting the school board is to consider and vote upon the question of whether there shall be submitted to the electors of the school district a proposition to abolish the offices of township treasurer and trustee of schools of that township. None of the notices given under this paragraph to the township treasurer and trustees of schools of a township shall be deemed sufficient or in compliance with the requirements of this paragraph unless all of those notices are given within the same 30 day period.
        (2) Each school board of each elementary and unit
    	
school district that is subject to the jurisdiction and authority of the township treasurer and trustees of schools of the township in which those offices are sought to be abolished, by the affirmative vote of at least 5 members of the school board at a school board meeting of which notice is given as required by paragraph (1) of this subsection, adopts a resolution requiring the secretary of the school board to certify to the proper election authorities for submission to the electors of the school district at the next consolidated election in accordance with the general election law a proposition to abolish the offices of township treasurer and trustee of schools of that township. None of the resolutions adopted under this paragraph by any elementary or unit school districts that are subject to the jurisdiction and authority of the township treasurer and trustees of schools of the township in which those offices are sought to be abolished shall be deemed in compliance with the requirements of this paragraph or sufficient to authorize submission of the proposition to abolish those offices to a referendum of the electors in any such school district unless all of the school boards of all of the elementary and unit school districts that are subject to the jurisdiction and authority of the township treasurer and trustees of schools of that township adopt such a resolution in accordance with the provisions of this paragraph.
        (3) The school boards of all of the elementary and
    	
unit school districts that are subject to the jurisdiction and authority of the township treasurer and trustees of schools of the township in which those offices are sought to be abolished submit a proposition to abolish the offices of township treasurer and trustee of schools of that township to the electors of their respective school districts at the same consolidated election in accordance with the general election law, the ballot in each such district to be in substantially the following form:
    ----------------------------------------------------------
OFFICIAL BALLOT
            Shall the offices of township
            treasurer and                       YES
            trustee of                      ------------------
            schools of Township .....           NO
            Range ..... be abolished?
    ----------------------------------------------------------
        (4) At the consolidated election at which the
    	
proposition to abolish the offices of township treasurer and trustee of schools of a township is submitted to the electors of each elementary and unit school district that is subject to the jurisdiction and authority of the township treasurer and trustee of schools of that township, a majority of the electors voting on the proposition in each such elementary and unit school district votes in favor of the proposition as submitted to them.
    If in each elementary and unit school district that is subject to the jurisdiction and authority of the township treasurer and trustees of schools of the township in which those offices are sought to be abolished a majority of the electors in each such district voting at the consolidated election on the proposition to abolish the offices of township treasurer and trustee of schools of that township votes in favor of the proposition as submitted to them, the proposition shall be deemed to have passed; but if in any such elementary or unit school district a majority of the electors voting on that proposition in that district fails to vote in favor of the proposition as submitted to them, then notwithstanding the vote of the electors in any other such elementary or unit school district on that proposition the proposition shall not be deemed to have passed in any of those elementary or unit school districts, and the offices of township treasurer and trustee of schools of the township in which those offices were sought to be abolished shall not be abolished, unless in each of those elementary and unit school districts remaining subject to the jurisdiction and authority of the township treasurer and trustees of schools of that township proceedings are again initiated to abolish those offices and all of the proceedings and conditions prescribed in paragraphs (1) through (4) of this subsection are repeated and met in each of those elementary and unit school districts.
    Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section or any other provision of the School Code, the offices of township treasurer and trustee of schools of a township that has a population of less than 200,000 and that contains a unit school district and is located in a Class II county school unit shall also be abolished as provided in this subsection if all of the conditions set forth in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subsection are met and if the following additional condition is met:
        The electors in all of the school districts subject
    	
to the jurisdiction and authority of the township treasurer and trustees of schools of the township in which those offices are sought to be abolished shall vote at the consolidated election on the proposition to abolish the offices of township treasurer and trustee of schools of that township. If a majority of the electors in all of the school districts combined voting on the proposition vote in favor of the proposition, then the proposition shall be deemed to have passed; but if a majority of the electors voting on the proposition in all of the school district fails to vote in favor of the proposition as submitted to them, then the proposition shall not be deemed to have passed and the offices of township treasurer and trustee of schools of the township in which those offices were sought to be abolished shall not be abolished, unless and until the proceedings detailed in paragraphs (1) through (3) of this subsection and the conditions set forth in this paragraph are met.
    If the proposition to abolish the offices of township treasurer and trustee of schools of a township is deemed to have passed at the consolidated election as provided in this subsection, those offices shall be deemed abolished by operation of law effective on January 1 of the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which that consolidated election is held, provided that if after the election, the trustees of schools by resolution elect to abolish the offices of township treasurer and trustee of schools effective on July 1 immediately following the election, then the offices shall be abolished on July 1 immediately following the election. On the date that the offices of township treasurer and trustee of schools of a township are deemed abolished by operation of law, the school board of each elementary and unit school district and the school board of each high school district that is subject to the jurisdiction and authority of the township treasurer and trustees of schools of that township at the time those offices are abolished: (i) shall appoint its own school treasurer as provided in Section 8-1; and (ii) unless the term of the contract of a township treasurer expires on the date that the office of township treasurer is abolished, shall pay to the former township treasurer its proportionate share of any aggregate compensation that, were the office of township treasurer not abolished at that time, would have been payable to the former township treasurer after that date over the remainder of the term of the contract of the former township treasurer that began prior to but ends after that date. In addition, on the date that the offices of township treasurer and trustee of schools of a township are deemed abolished as provided in this subsection, the school board of each elementary school, high school and unit school district that until that date is subject to the jurisdiction and authority of the township treasurer and trustees of schools of that township shall be deemed by operation of law to have agreed and assumed to pay and, when determined, shall pay to the Illinois Municipal Retirement Fund a proportionate share of the unfunded liability existing in that Fund at the time these offices are abolished in that calendar year for all annuities or other benefits then or thereafter to become payable from that Fund with respect to all periods of service performed prior to that date as a participating employee in that Fund by persons serving during those periods of service as a trustee of schools, township treasurer or regular employee in the office of the township treasurer of that township. That unfunded liability shall be actuarially determined by the board of trustees of the Illinois Municipal Retirement Fund, and the board of trustees shall thereupon notify each school board required to pay a proportionate share of that unfunded liability of the aggregate amount of the unfunded liability so determined. The amount so paid to the Illinois Municipal Retirement Fund by each of those school districts shall be credited to the account of the township in that Fund. For each elementary school, high school and unit school district under the jurisdiction and authority of a township treasurer and trustees of schools of a township in which those offices are abolished as provided in this subsection, each such district's proportionate share of the aggregate compensation payable to the former township treasurer as provided in this paragraph and each such district's proportionate share of the aggregate amount of the unfunded liability payable to the Illinois Municipal Retirement Fund as provided in this paragraph shall be computed in accordance with the ratio that the number of pupils in average daily attendance in each such district for the school year last ending prior to the date on which the offices of township treasurer and trustee of schools of that township are abolished bears to the aggregate number of pupils in average daily attendance in all of those districts as so reported for that school year.
    Upon abolition of the offices of township treasurer and trustee of schools of a township as provided in this subsection: (i) the regional board of school trustees, in its corporate capacity, shall be deemed the successor in interest to the former trustees of schools of that township with respect to the common school lands and township loanable funds of the township; (ii) all right, title and interest existing or vested in the former trustees of schools of that township in the common school lands and township loanable funds of the township, and all records, moneys, securities and other assets, rights of property and causes of action pertaining to or constituting a part of those common school lands or township loanable funds, shall be transferred to and deemed vested by operation of law in the regional board of school trustees, which shall hold legal title to, manage and operate all common school lands and township loanable funds of the township, receive the rents, issues and profits therefrom, and have and exercise with respect thereto the same powers and duties as are provided by this Code to be exercised by regional boards of school trustees when acting as township land commissioners in counties having at least 220,000 but fewer than 2,000,000 inhabitants; (iii) the regional board of school trustees shall select to serve as its treasurer with respect to the common school lands and township loanable funds of the township a person from time to time also serving as the appointed school treasurer of any school district that was subject to the jurisdiction and authority of the township treasurer and trustees of schools of that township at the time those offices were abolished, and the person selected to also serve as treasurer of the regional board of school trustees shall have his compensation for services in that capacity fixed by the regional board of school trustees, to be paid from the township loanable funds, and shall make to the regional board of school trustees the reports required to be made by treasurers of township land commissioners, give bond as required by treasurers of township land commissioners, and perform the duties and exercise the powers of treasurers of township land commissioners; (iv) the regional board of school trustees shall designate in the manner provided by Section 8-7, insofar as applicable, a depositary for its treasurer, and the proceeds of all rents, issues and profits from the common school lands and township loanable funds of that township shall be deposited and held in the account maintained for those purposes with that depositary and shall be expended and distributed therefrom as provided in Section 15-24 and other applicable provisions of this Code; and (v) whenever there is vested in the trustees of schools of a township at the time that office is abolished under this subsection the legal title to any school buildings or school sites used or occupied for school purposes by any elementary school, high school or unit school district subject to the jurisdiction and authority of those trustees of school at the time that office is abolished, the legal title to those school buildings and school sites shall be deemed transferred by operation of law to and invested in the school board of that school district, in its corporate capacity under Section 10-22.35B of this Code, the same to be held, sold, exchanged leased or otherwise transferred in accordance with applicable provisions of this Code.
    Notwithstanding Section 2-3.25g of this Code, a waiver of a mandate established under this Section may not be requested.

        3. The cost of a record book, if any.
        4. The cost of dividing school lands and making
    	
plats.
    If the income of the permanent township fund is not sufficient to meet such items the additional amount needed may be taken from the total of other funds subject to distribution, each district -- exclusive of any district which has withdrawn from the jurisdiction and authority of the trustees of schools of the township and which has elected or appointed its own school treasurer as provided in subsection (b) of Section 5-1 -- being charged as its share of such items the proportion which the amount of school funds of the district handled by the township treasurer bears to the total amount of all school funds handled by such treasurer.
    In Class II county school units (excluding therefrom, however, any township therein in which the offices of township treasurer and trustee of schools have been abolished as provided in subsection (c) of Section 5-1) if any balance of the income from the permanent township fund in any township remains after paying such items, such balance shall be apportioned and distributed to the districts and parts of districts in the township -- including any district which has withdrawn from the jurisdiction and authority of the trustees of schools of the township and which has elected or appointed its own school treasurer as provided in subsection (b) of Section 5-1 -- in which schools have been kept as required by law during the preceding year ending June 30, according to the number of pupils in average daily attendance in grades one to eight inclusive. At the semi-annual meetings in all such townships all remaining funds subject to distribution shall be apportioned and distributed to the districts and parts of districts in the township in which schools have been kept as required by law during the preceding year ending June 30, in the manner and subject to the limitations prescribed in Sections 18-2 through 18-11 for the distribution of the common school fund among the counties, provided that -- except for any balance of the income from the permanent township fund remaining after payment of the items set forth in subparagraphs 1, 2, 3 and 4 of this Section -- no funds shall be apportioned or distributed to any school district which has withdrawn from the jurisdiction and authority of the trustees of schools and appointed its own school treasurer pursuant to Section 5-1; and the trustees shall direct the treasurer to make a regular monthly apportionment and distribution between semi-annual meetings, in the manner prescribed by those sections, of any available funds on hand from the common school fund. The funds distributed shall be credited to the respective districts and parts of districts.
    In Class I county school units and in any township forming a part of a Class II county school unit in which township the offices of township treasurer and trustee of schools have been abolished as provided in subsection (c) of Section 5-1, if any balance of income from the permanent township fund in any township remains after paying such items, such balance or a part thereof equal to but not greater than the then current tax levy or tax levies for common school purposes by all the school districts or parts of school districts in said township on property in said township in process of collection in the county wherein the township having such fund is located, shall, upon an order drawn by the treasurer and signed by the president and secretary of the township land commissioners or regional board of school trustees, be paid annually on or before February 1 to the County Treasurer of the county in which such township is situated. It shall then be the duty of the County Treasurer to apply and credit the sum so received upon all tax bills for school purposes of the taxpayers in the township, said sum to be applied and credited proportionately upon the basis of the value of assessed property represented by each such tax bill. Any sum received by the County Treasurer in excess of the amount required to discharge in full the amount of all taxes for school purposes so extended against taxable property within the township shall be held by the County Treasurer and applied to taxes subsequently extended for such purposes: Provided, that if a petition, signed by at least 5% of the legal voters of the township, is presented to the regional superintendent of schools of the educational service region in which the township is located requesting a vote on the proposition that such balance of the income from the permanent township fund shall be apportioned and distributed to the districts and parts of districts in the township in which schools have been kept as required by law during the preceding year ending June 30, according to the number of pupils in average daily attendance in grades one to eight, inclusive, upon an order drawn by the treasurer and signed by the president and secretary of the township land commissioners or regional board of school trustees, to be paid annually on or before February 1, the regional superintendent of schools shall certify to the proper election authority the proposition for submission to the voters of the township in accordance with the general election law. The treasurer shall cause a copy of the order to be published in one or more newspapers published in the county school unit within 10 days after the order is drawn. If no newspaper is published in the county school unit, the order shall be published in a newspaper having general circulation within the county school unit. The publication of the order shall include a notice of (1) the specific number of voters required to sign a petition requesting that the proposition to apportion and distribute to the several school districts the excess of the income from the permanent township fund be submitted to the voters of the township; (2) the time within which the petition must be filed; and (3) the date of the prospective referendum. The treasurer shall provide a petition form to any individual requesting one. If the proposition receives a majority of the votes cast thereon, it shall supersede the preceding provisions for the distribution of such balance.

    Sec. 5-22. Sales of school sites, buildings or other real estate. When, in the opinion of the school board, a school site, or portion thereof, building, or site with building thereon or any other real estate of the district has become unnecessary, unsuitable, or inconvenient for a school or unnecessary for the uses of the district, the school board, by a resolution adopted by at least two-thirds of the board members, may sell or direct that the property be sold in the manner provided in the Local Government Property Transfer Act or in the manner herein provided or, in the case of residential property constructed or renovated by students as part of a curricular program, may engage the services of a licensed real estate broker to sell the property for a commission not to exceed 7%, contingent on the public listing of the property on a multiple listing service for a minimum of 14 calendar days and the sale of the property within 120 days.
    Unless legal title to the land is held by the school board, the school board shall forthwith notify the trustees of schools or other school officials having legal title to such land of the terms upon which they desire the property to be sold. If the property is to be sold to another unit of local government or school district, the school board, trustees of schools, or other school officials having legal title to the land shall proceed in the manner provided in the Local Government Property Transfer Act. In all other cases, except if the property is to be sold to a tenant that has leased the property for 10 or more years and that tenant is a non-profit agency, the school board, trustees of schools, or other school officials having legal title to the land shall, within 60 days after adoption of the resolution (if the school board holds legal title to the land), or within 60 days after the trustees of school or other school officials having legal title receive the notice (if the school board does not hold legal title to the land), sell the property at public sale, by auction or sealed bids, after first giving notice of the time, place, and terms thereof by notice published once each week for 3 successive weeks prior to the date of the sale if sale is by auction, or prior to the final date of acceptance of bids if sale is by sealed bids, in a newspaper published in the district or, if no such newspaper is published in the district, then in a newspaper published in the county and having a general circulation in the district; however, if territory containing a school site, building, or site with building thereon, is detached from the school district of which it is a part after proceedings have been commenced under this Section for the sale of that school site, building, or site with building thereon, but before the sale is held, then the school board, trustees of schools, or other school officials having legal title shall not advertise or sell that school site, building, or site with building thereon, pursuant to those proceedings. The notices may be in the following form:
NOTICE OF SALE
    Notice is hereby given that on (insert date), the (here insert title of the school board, trustees of school, or other school officials holding legal title) of (county) (Township No. ...., Range No. .... P.M. ....) will sell at public sale (use applicable alternative) (at .........

....
....

(Here insert title of school
officials holding legal title)

    For purposes of determining "terms of sale" under this Section, the General Assembly declares by this clarifying and amendatory Act of 1983 that "terms of sale" are not limited to sales for cash only but include contracts for deed, mortgages, and such other seller financed terms as may be specified by the school board.
    If a school board specifies a reasonable minimum selling price and that price is not met or if no bids are received, the school board may adopt a resolution determining or directing that the services of a licensed real estate broker be engaged to sell the property for a commission not to exceed 7%, contingent on the sale of the property within 120 days. If legal title to the property is not held by the school board, the trustees of schools or other school officials having legal title shall, upon receipt of the resolution, engage the services of a licensed real estate broker as directed in the resolution. The board may accept a written offer equal to or greater than the established minimum selling price for the described property. The services of a licensed real estate broker may be utilized to seek a buyer. If the board lowers the minimum selling price on the described property, the public sale procedures set forth in this Section must be followed. The board may raise the minimum selling price without repeating the public sale procedures.
    In the case of a sale of property to a tenant that has leased the property for 10 or more years and that is a non-profit agency, an appraisal is required prior to the sale. If the non-profit agency purchases the property for less than the appraised value and subsequently sells the property, the agency may retain only a percentage of the profits that is proportional to the percentage of the appraisal, plus any improvements made by the agency while the agency was the owner, that the agency paid in the initial sale. The remaining portion of the profits made by the non-profit agency shall revert to the school district.
    The deed of conveyance shall be executed by the president and clerk or secretary of the school board, trustees of schools, or other school officials having legal title to the land, and the proceeds paid to the school treasurer for the benefit of the district. The school board shall use the proceeds from the sale first to pay the principal and interest on any outstanding bonds on the property being sold, and after all such bonds have been retired, the remaining proceeds from the sale next shall be used by the school board to meet any urgent district needs as determined under Sections 2-3.12 and 17-2.11 and then for any other authorized purpose and for deposit into any district fund. But whenever the school board of any school district determines that any schoolhouse site with or without a building thereon is of no further use to the district, and agrees with the school board of any other school district within the boundaries of which the site is situated, upon the sale thereof to that district, and agrees upon the price to be paid therefor, and the site is selected by the purchasing district in the manner required by law, then after the payment of the compensation the school board, township trustees, or other school officials having legal title to the land of the schools shall, by proper instrument in writing, convey the legal title of the site to the school board of the purchasing district, or to the trustees of schools for the use of the purchasing district, in accordance with law. The provisions of this Section shall not apply to any sale made pursuant to Section 5-23 or Section 5-24 or Section 32-4.

    Whenever the school board, by a two-thirds majority of its members shall find and declare the following propositions and shall cause to be recorded in the Recorder's Office a certificate embodying such findings and declarations duly signed by its president and attested by its secretary or clerk, then said school board may cause the exchange of a present school site or site with building thereon for a substitutional site without a referendum approving such exchange. The above findings and declarations shall establish the following: (1) That in the opinion of the school board a school site or site with building thereon has become unsuitable or inconvenient for a school; (2) that a substitutional school site has been offered in exchange for the present site which is a suitable, convenient and desirable site for a school and (3) that the value of the substitutional site is equal to or exceeds the value of the present site for which it is to be exchanged, the criterion of value to be that of a fair market value. When such certificate has been recorded as aforesaid, the school board shall transmit a copy of said certificate to the trustees of schools or other school officials having legal title to such land and shall request the execution of a deed of conveyance by the president and clerk, or secretary, as the case may be, to be delivered upon the receipt of a good and sufficient deed conveying to the trustees of schools or other school officials entitled under the statute to hold legal title to lands in the particular school district a good title to the substitutional site; and such president and clerk, or secretary, as the case may be, shall comply with such request. If the school board of a school district holds legal title to any lands to be exchanged under this Section, the certificate shall be recorded by the school board, and the deed of conveyance shall be executed by the president and by the secretary or clerk of the school board, as the case may be, and shall be delivered when a good and sufficient deed conveying the legal title of the substitutional site to the school board is delivered to the school board. The certificate provided for shall set forth an accurate legal description of the present school site and of the substitutional site offered as aforesaid.

Thereupon, that protectorate high school district shall thereafter exist as a community high school district and possess and enjoy all of the powers, duties and authorities of a community high school district under Article 12 of this Act.
    Throughout its existence as a protectorate district and until the legal voters residing in the district have determined to maintain and operate a high school within the district and have been authorized to purchase a school site, build a school building and to issue bonds for such purpose and which bonds are duly issued, or until the dissolution of the district as required by this Section, such protectorate district may use its funds to pay for the tuition and transportation of the pupils in such district that attend a high school in a special charter district maintaining grades 1 through 12.

    (a) There is created a regional board of school trustees for that territory in each educational service region exclusive of any school district organized under Article 34 and exclusive of any school district whose school board has been given the powers of school trustees; provided that on the effective date of this amendatory Act of 1992 the regional board of school trustees theretofore created and existing for any territory in an educational service region containing 2,000,000 or more inhabitants is abolished, the terms of office of all members of the regional board of school trustees so abolished are terminated on that effective date, and from and after that effective date all rights, powers, duties, and responsibilities that were vested in or required by law to be exercised and performed by the former regional board of school trustees shall be vested in and exercised and performed by the successors to the former regional board of school trustees as provided in subsection (b) of this Section 6-2. Any school district whose board of education acts as a board of school trustees shall have within its district the powers and duties of a regional board of school trustees.
    Unless abolished as provided in this Section, the regional board of school trustees, in both single county and multi-county educational service regions, shall consist of 7 members. In single county regions not more than one trustee may be a resident of any one congressional township; however, in case there are fewer than 7 congressional townships in the region then not more than two of such trustees may be residents of the same congressional township. Notwithstanding the foregoing residency provision, in a single county region with a population of greater than 750,000 inhabitants, but less than 1,200,000 inhabitants, 2 trustees may be residents of the same congressional township if and only if such trustees were elected at the April 9, 2013 consolidated election. In 2 county regions at least 2 trustees shall be residents of each county. In 3 or more county regions at least one trustee shall be a resident of each county. If more than 7 counties constitute the educational service region, the regional board of school trustees shall consist of one resident of each county.
    The regional board of school trustees shall be a body politic and corporate by the name of "Regional Board of School Trustees of.... County (or Counties), Illinois." Such corporation shall have perpetual existence with power to sue and be sued and to plead and be impleaded in all courts and places where judicial proceedings are had.
    (b) Upon the abolition of the regional board of school trustees and the termination of the terms of office of the members of that former regional board of school trustees in an educational service region containing 2,000,000 or more inhabitants as provided in subsection (a), the trustees of schools of each township included within the territory of that educational service region that was served by the former regional board of school trustees, or if any such township is a township referred to in subsection (b) of Section 5-1 and there are no trustees of schools acting in that township then the school board of each school district located in that township, shall be the successors to the former regional board of school trustees.

    (a) School district boundaries may be changed by detachment, annexation, division or dissolution or any combination thereof by the regional board of school trustees or by the State Superintendent of Education as provided in subsection (l) of Section 7-6.
    The petition must be filed with and decided solely by the regional board of school trustees of the region in which the regional superintendent of schools has supervision and control, as defined in Section 3-14.2 of this Code, of the detaching or dissolving school district. The petition may be filed in any office operated by the regional superintendent with supervision and control, as defined in Section 3-14.2 of this Code, of the detaching or dissolving school district.
    A petition for boundary change must be filed by the school board of the detaching or dissolving district, by a majority of the legal resident voters in the dissolving district, or by two-thirds of a combination of the legal resident voters and the owners of record of any real estate with no legal resident voters in any territory proposed to be detached. If any of the territory proposed to be detached contains real estate with no legal resident voters, petitioners shall deliver the petition by certified mail, return receipt requested, to all owners of record of any real estate with no legal resident voters. Proof of such delivery must be presented as evidence at the hearing required under Section 7-6 of this Code. Any owner of record of real estate with no legal resident voters in any territory proposed to be detached may either sign the petition in person and before the circulator as described in this Section or return the petition with his or her notarized signature to be included as a petitioner. No person may sign a petition in the capacity of both a legal resident voter and owner of record. If there are no legal resident voters within the territory proposed to be detached, then the petition must be signed by all of the owners of record of the real estate of the territory. Legal resident voters shall be determined by the official voter registration lists as of the date the petition is filed. No signatures shall be added or withdrawn after the date the petition is filed. The length of time for signatures to be valid, before filing of the petition, shall not exceed 6 months. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained in the Election Code, the regional superintendent of schools shall make all determinations regarding the validity of the petition, including, without limitation, signatures on the petition. If the regional superintendent determines that the petition is not in proper order or not in compliance with any applicable petition requirements, the regional superintendent may not accept the petition for filing and may return the petition to the petitioners. Any party who is dissatisfied with the determination of the regional superintendent regarding the validity of the petition may appeal the regional superintendent's decision to the regional board of school trustees by motion, and the motion must be heard by the regional board of school trustees prior to any hearing on the merits of the petition.
    Petitions for detachment and dissolution shall include the full prayer of the petition with a general description of the territory at the top of each page. Each signature contained therein shall match the official signature and address of the legal resident voters as recorded in the office of the county clerk or board of election commissioners, and each petitioner shall record the date of his or her signing. Except in instances of a notarized signature of an owner of record of real estate with no legal resident voters in any territory proposed to be detached, each page of the circulated petition shall be signed by a circulator stating that he or she has witnessed the signature of each petitioner on that page. Detachment petitions containing 10 or fewer signatures may be notarized in lieu of a circulator statement. Each petition shall include an accurate legal description and map of the territory proposed to be detached. If a petition proposes to dissolve an entire district, then the full name and number of the district and a map are sufficient. Each petition shall include the names of petitioners; the district to be dissolved or the district from which the territory is proposed to be detached; the district or districts to which the territory is proposed to be annexed; evidence that the detaching or dissolving territory is compact and contiguous with the annexing district or districts or otherwise meets the requirements set forth in Section 7-4 of this Code; the referendum date, if applicable; and facts that support favorable findings for the factors to be considered by the regional board of school trustees pursuant to Section 7-6 of this Code.
    Where there is only one school building in an approved operating district, the building and building site may not be included in any detachment proceeding.
    Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Code, if, pursuant to a petition filed under this subsection (a), all of the territory of a school district is to be annexed to another school district, then any action by the regional board of school trustees in granting or approving the petition and any change in school district boundaries pursuant to that action is subject to and the change in school district boundaries may not be made except upon approval, at a regular scheduled election, in the manner provided by Section 7-7.7 of this Code, of a proposition for the annexation of all of the territory of that school district to the other school district.
    No petition may be filed under this Section to form a new school district under this Article; however, such a petition may be filed under this Section to form a new school district if the boundaries of such new school district lie entirely within the boundaries of a military base or installation operated and maintained by the government of the United States.
    (b) Any elementary or high school district with 100 or more of its students residing upon territory located entirely within a military base or installation operated and maintained by the government of the United States, or any unit school district or any combination of the above mentioned districts with 300 or more of its students residing upon territory located entirely within a military base or installation operated and maintained by the government of the United States, shall, upon the filing with the regional board of school trustees of a petition adopted by resolution of the board of education or a petition signed by a majority of the registered voters residing upon such military base or installation, have all of the territory lying entirely within such military base or installation detached from such school district, and a new school district comprised of such territory shall be created. The petition shall be filed with and decided solely by the regional board of school trustees of the region in which the regional superintendent of schools has supervision and control, as defined by Section 3-14.2 of this Code, of the school district affected. The regional board of school trustees shall have no authority to deny the detachment and creation of a new school district requested in a proper petition filed under this subsection. This subsection shall apply only to those school districts having a population of not fewer than 1,000 and not more than 500,000 residents, as ascertained by any special or general census.
    The new school district shall tuition its students to the same districts that its students were previously attending and the districts from which the new district was detached shall continue to educate the students from the new district, until the federal government provides other arrangements. The federal government shall pay for the education of such children as required by Section 6 of Public Law 81-874.
    If a school district created under this subsection (b) has not elected a school board and has not become operational within 2 years after the date of detachment, then this district is automatically dissolved and the territory of this district reverts to the school district from which the territory was detached or any successor district thereto. Any school district created under this subsection (b) on or before September 1, 1996 that has not elected a school board and has not been operational since September 1, 1996 is automatically dissolved on the effective date of this amendatory Act of 1999, and on this date the territory of this district reverts to the school district from which the territory was detached. For the automatic dissolution of a school district created under this subsection (b), the regional superintendent of schools who has supervision and control, as defined by Section 3-14.2 of this Code, of the school district from which the territory was detached shall certify to the regional board of school trustees that the school district created under this subsection (b) has been automatically dissolved.

No petition shall be adopted or signed under this subsection until the board of education or the petitioners, as the case may be, shall have given at least 10 days' notice to be published once in a newspaper having general circulation in the district and shall have conducted a public informational meeting to inform the residents of the district of the proposed dissolution and to answer questions concerning the proposed dissolution. The petition shall be filed with and decided solely by the regional board of school trustees of the region in which the regional superintendent of schools has supervision and control, as defined by Section 3-14.2 of this Code, of the school district being dissolved.
    The regional board of school trustees shall not act on a petition filed by a board of education if within 45 days after giving the first notice of the hearing required under Section 7-11 of this Code a petition in opposition to the petition of the board to dissolve, signed by a majority of the legal resident voters of the district, is filed with the regional board of school trustees. In such an event, the dissolution petition is dismissed on procedural grounds by operation of law and the regional board of school trustees shall have no further authority to consider the petition. A dissolution petition dismissed as the result of a valid opposition petition is not subject to the limitation on successive petitions as provided in Section 7-8 of this Code, and a new petition may be filed upon receipt of the regional board of school trustees' notice stating that the original petition was dismissed by operation of law.
    For all petitions under this Section, the legal resident voters must be determined by the official voter registration lists as of the date the petition is filed. No signatures may be added or withdrawn after the date the petition is filed. The length of time for signatures to be valid, before filing of the petition, may not exceed 6 months. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained in the Election Code, the regional superintendent of schools shall make all determinations regarding the validity of the petition, including, without limitation, signatures on the petition. Any party who is dissatisfied with the determination of the regional superintendent regarding the validity of the petition may appeal the regional superintendent's decision to the regional board of school trustees by motion, and the motion must be heard by the regional board of school trustees prior to any hearing on annexing the territory of a district being dissolved. If no opposition petition is timely filed, the regional board of school trustees shall have no authority to deny dissolution requested in a proper petition for dissolution filed under this Section, but shall exercise its discretion in accordance with Section 7-11 of this Code on the issue of annexing the territory of a district being dissolved, giving consideration to but not being bound by the wishes expressed by the residents of the various school districts that may be affected by such annexation.

    Any contiguous portion of an elementary school district that constitutes 5% or less of the equalized assessed value of the district and 5% or less of the territory of the district shall upon petition of two-thirds of the registered voters of the territory proposed to be detached and annexed be so detached and annexed by the regional board of school trustees if granting such petition shall make the affected segment of the boundaries of the elementary school district the territory is proposed to be annexed to identical, for the entirety of such affected segment, to the boundaries of the high school district in which the territory is located.
    The regional board of school trustees shall have no authority or discretion to hear any evidence or consider any issues except those that may be necessary to determine whether the limitations and conditions of this Section have been met.
    No district may lose more than 5% of its equalized assessed value or more than 5% of its territory through petitions filed under this Section. If a petition seeks to detach territory that would result in a cumulative total of more than 5% of a district's equalized assessed value or more than 5% of the district's territory being detached under this Section, the petition shall be denied without prejudice to its being filed pursuant to Section 7-6 of this Code. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section, this paragraph shall apply to any detachments effected pursuant to the provisions of this Section as they existed prior to the effective date of this amendatory Act of the 91st General Assembly.
    (b) At any time prior to the granting of the petition calling for the detachment and annexation of non-coterminous territory under this Section, the Committee of Ten designated in the petition may amend the petition to withdraw the detachment and annexation proposal and substitute in its place a proposal to require the school district from which the territory would have been detached to pay the per capita tuition costs for each pupil residing in the non-coterminous territory to attend the school district to which the territory would have been annexed. If such amended petition is granted, the school district from which the territory would have been detached shall pay to the school district to which the territory would have been annexed the per capita tuition costs as determined under Section 10-20.12a for each pupil residing in the territory who chooses to attend the school district to which the territory would have been annexed. Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 10-22.5, the school district to which the territory would have been annexed shall admit any pupil that resides in the non-coterminous territory and provide such pupils with any services of the school. The payment and collection of tuition and any other such matters as may need to be resolved shall be established by an intergovernmental agreement developed between the two affected school districts. Section 7-6 of this Code shall apply to petitions filed under this Section except as otherwise provided in this Section.
    The changes made by this amendatory Act of the 91st General Assembly shall not apply to petitions pending on the effective date of this amendatory Act of the 91st General Assembly.

    Sec. 7-2c. Change of school district boundaries following annexation of vacant and unincorporated territory to a contiguous municipality.
    Notwithstanding any other provision of this Code, any contiguous portion of an elementary school district may be detached from that district and annexed to an adjoining elementary school district, and any contiguous portion of a high school district may be detached from that district and annexed to an adjoining high school district, upon a petition or petitions filed under this Section, when all of the following conditions are met with respect to each petition so filed:
        (1) The portion of the district to be so detached and
    	
annexed to an adjoining elementary or high school district consists of not more than 160 acres of vacant land that is located in an unincorporated area of a county of 2,000,000 or more inhabitants and, on the effective date of this amendatory Act of 1997, is contiguous to one municipality that is (i) wholly outside the elementary or high school district from which the vacant land is to be detached and (ii) located entirely within the territorial boundaries of the adjoining elementary or high school district to which the vacant land is to be annexed.
        (2) The equalized assessed valuation of the taxable
    	
property located in the portion of the district that is to be so detached and annexed to the adjoining elementary or high school district constitutes less than 1% of the equalized assessed valuation of the taxable property of the district from which it is to be detached.
        (3) The portion of the district to be so detached and
    	
annexed to the adjoining elementary or high school district is annexed to the contiguous municipality pursuant to a petition for annexation filed and pending with the annexing municipality upon the effective date of this amendatory Act.
    A petition filed under this Section shall be filed with the State Superintendent of Education and shall be signed by all of the owners of record of the vacant land that comprises the portion of the district that is to be detached and annexed to the adjoining elementary or high school district under the provisions of this Section. The State Superintendent shall: (i) hold a hearing on the petition within 90 days after the date of filing; (ii) render a decision granting or denying the petition within 30 days after the hearing; and (iii) promptly serve a copy of the decision by certified mail, return receipt requested, upon the petitioners and upon the school boards of the school districts from which the territory described in the petition is sought to be detached and to which that territory is sought to be annexed.
    The State Superintendent of Education has no authority or discretion to hear any evidence or consider any issues at the hearing except those that may be necessary to determine whether the limitations and conditions of this Section have been met.
    The State Superintendent of Education: (i) shall give written notice of the time and place of the hearing, not less than 30 days prior to the date of the hearing, to the school board of the school district from which the territory described in the petition is to be detached and to the school board of the school district to which that territory is to be annexed; and (ii) shall publish notice of the hearing in a newspaper that is published in the county in which the territory described in the petition is located and that has circulation within the school districts whose school boards are entitled to written notice of the hearing.
    In the event that the granting of a petition filed under this Section has become final, either through failure to seek administrative review or by the final decision of a court on review, the change in boundaries shall become effective forthwith and for all purposes, except that if the granting of the petition becomes final between September 1 and June 30 of any year, the administration of and attendance at the schools shall not be affected until the following July 1, when the change in boundaries shall become effective for all purposes. After the granting of a petition has become final, the date when the change shall become effective for purposes of administration and attendance may be accelerated or postponed by stipulation of the school boards of the school districts from which the territory described in the petition is detached and to which that territory is annexed.
    The decision of the State Superintendent of Education shall be deemed an "administrative decision" as defined in Section 3-101 of the Administrative Review Law, and any petitioner or the school board of a school district affected by the detachment and annexation of the territory described in the petition may within 35 days after a copy of the decision sought to be reviewed was served by certified mail upon the party affected thereby, or upon the attorney of record for such party, apply for a review of such decision in accordance with the Administrative Review Law, and all amendments and modifications thereof and the rules adopted pursuant thereto.
    The commencement of any action for review shall operate as a supersedeas, and no further proceedings shall be had until final disposition of such review. The circuit court of the county in which the petition is filed with the State Superintendent of Education shall have sole jurisdiction to entertain a complaint for such review.
    This Section: (i) is not limited by and operates independently of all other provisions of this Article, and (ii) constitutes complete authority for the granting or denial by the State Superintendent of Education of a petition filed under this Section when the conditions prescribed by this Section for the filing of that petition are met.

    Sec. 7-2.3. Annexation to special charter district.
    (a) Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained in any special act or special charter of any school district, annexation of territory to any city or village under the Illinois Municipal Code after the effective date of this amendatory Act of 1967 does not constitute annexation of the territory to the special charter school district nor detachment from any school district adjacent to the special charter district. Except as otherwise provided in subsection (b) of this Section, the boundaries of a special charter district may be changed as provided in Sections 7-2.4 through 7-2.7.
    (b) If all or any part of a special charter school district is located in a special charter city, then upon the filing with the governing body of the special charter school district of a petition to detach the territory described in the petition from the school district of which that territory forms a part and to annex that territory to the special charter school district, the territory described in the petition shall be deemed to be so detached and annexed to the special charter school district by operation of law, if all of the following conditions are met: (i) the petition is signed by at least 51% of the owners of record and 51% of the electors, if any, residing in the territory described in the petition; and (ii) the territory described in the petition is located in the special charter city, is contiguous to the special charter school district, and does not include any commercially zoned properties that are contiguous to each other and together constitute in excess of 100 acres of land and are not separated by a State highway and that are used solely for office/research and hotel purposes. A certified copy of the petition and the resolution or order of the governing body of the special charter school district evidencing the annexation of the territory described in the petition to the special charter school district by operation of law shall be mailed by that governing body to each school district affected and to the regional board or boards of school trustees for the educational service region or regions in which the affected school districts are located. A person who is a resident of any territory described in the petition at the time of its detachment from one school district and its annexation to a special charter school district under this subsection, and whose child or children are then attending school in the district from which that territory is being detached, may elect to have that child or those children and their siblings attend the schools of the district from which the territory is being detached. However, in that event the special charter school district shall pay tuition in the amount provided by law to the school district from which the territory is detached for each of those children and siblings who attend the schools of that district.

A petition for detachment of territory from a special charter district with annexation to another school district, for detachment of territory from a school district with annexation to a special charter district, or for dissolution of a school district with annexation to a special charter district must be filed with the governing body of the special charter district, and a certified copy thereof must be sent to each other detaching, dissolving, or annexing school district and to the regional board of school trustees of the region in which the regional superintendent has supervision and control, as defined in Section 3-14.2 of this Code, of the detaching or dissolving district. A petition for such annexation or detachment of territory must be filed by the school board of the detaching or dissolving district, by a majority of the legal resident voters in the dissolving district, or by two-thirds of a combination of the legal resident voters and the owners of record of any real estate with no legal resident voters in any territory proposed to be detached. If any of the territory proposed to be detached contains real estate with no legal resident voters, petitioners shall deliver the petition by certified mail, return receipt requested, to all owners of record of any real estate with no legal resident voters. Proof of the delivery must be presented as evidence at any hearing required by Section 7-2.6 of this Code. Any owner of record of real estate with no legal resident voters in any territory proposed to be detached may either sign the petition in person and before the circulator as described in Section 7-1 of this Code or return the petition with his or her notarized signature to be included as a petitioner. No person may sign a petition in the capacity of both a legal resident voter and owner of record. If there are no legal resident voters within the territory proposed to be detached, then the petition must be signed by all of the owners of record of the real estate of the territory. Petitions must contain all of the elements set forth in subsection (a) of Section 7-1 of this Code.
    Where there is only one school building in an approved operating school district, the building and building site may not be included in any detachment proceeding.

If no objection to the dissolution or detachment of territory prayed for in a petition under Section 7-2.4 of this Code is filed with the special charter school district or with the regional board of school trustees within 30 days after the filing of such petition, the dissolution or detachment of territory takes effect, subject to Section 7-9 of this Code. However, if an objection to the proposed dissolution or detachment of territory is filed with either the special charter district or the regional board of school trustees, the regional board of school trustees, within 15 days after receiving the objection, shall appoint 2 legal resident voters from the district or districts under its jurisdiction and involved in the proposed dissolution or detachment of territory, subject to the approval of the boards of education of the districts involved in the proposed dissolution or detachment of territory, and the board or governing body of the special charter district shall appoint 2 legal resident voters from the special charter district. Those 4 appointees shall meet within 20 days of their appointment and by a majority vote select 3 persons who reside outside the jurisdiction of the districts involved in the proposed dissolution or detachment of territory and who have a demonstrated interest and background in education. If a majority of the original 4 appointees cannot agree on the selection of the 3 additional members within 20 days of their appointment, the State Board of Education shall select the 3 additional persons, subject to the same criteria as required when selection is by the 4 appointees. The 4 appointees and the 3 additional persons selected under this Section constitute the Hearing Board and 4 members shall constitute a quorum.
    Within 10 days after the Hearing Board has been selected the regional superintendent of schools of the region in which the special charter district is located shall call an organization meeting of said Hearing Board.

    The Hearing Board may administer oaths, determine the admissibility of evidence, and issue subpoenas for the attendance of witnesses and subpoena duces tecum for the production of documents.

If so determined, then the Hearing Board shall allow the petition to be heard anew in its entirety in accordance with all procedures in this Section. The party requesting a rehearing shall pay the expenses of publishing the notice and of any transcript taken at the hearing.

administrative office is documented as no more than 30 miles;

The committee of petitioners shall have the same power to stipulate to accountings or waiver thereof between school districts; however, the regional board of school trustees may refuse to accept such stipulation. Those designated as the committee of 10 shall serve in that capacity until such time as the regional superintendent of schools or the committee of 10 determines that, because of death, resignation, transfer of residency from the territory, or failure to qualify, the office of a particular member of the committee of 10 is vacant. Upon determination that a vacancy exists, the remaining members shall appoint a petitioner to fill the designated vacancy on the committee of 10. The appointment of any new members by the committee of 10 shall be made by a simple majority vote of the remaining designated members.
    (d) The petition may be amended to withdraw not to exceed a total of 10% of the territory in the petition at any time prior to the hearing; provided that the petition shall after amendment comply with the requirements as to the number of signatures required on an original petition.
    (e) The petitioners shall pay the expenses of publishing the notice and any transcript taken at the hearing and mailing the final order; and, in case of an appeal from the decision of the regional board of school trustees or State Superintendent of Education in cases determined under subsection (l) of this Section, the appellants shall pay the cost of preparing the record for appeal. The regional superintendent of schools with whom the petition is filed may request a deposit at the time of filing to cover expenses as provided in this subsection (e).
    (f) The notice shall state when the petition was filed, the description of the detaching territory or name of the dissolving district, the name of the annexing district, the prayer of the petition, and the day and time on and location in which the hearing upon the petition will be held, which shall not be more than 30 nor less than 15 calendar days after the publication of notice.
    (g) Prior to the hearing, the secretary of the regional board of school trustees shall submit to the regional board of school trustees maps showing the districts involved and a written report of the financial and educational conditions of the districts involved and the probable effect of the proposed changes. The reports and maps submitted must be made a part of the record of the proceedings of the regional board of school trustees. A copy of the report and maps submitted must be sent by the secretary of the regional board of school trustees to the president of the school board of each detaching or dissolving and annexing school district not less than 5 days prior to the day upon which the hearing is to be held.
    (h) On the hearing day or on a day to which the regional board of school trustees shall continue the hearing, the regional board of school trustees shall hear the petition but may adjourn the hearing from time to time or may continue the matter for want of sufficient notice or other good cause.
    (h-5) Except for motions and briefs challenging the validity of a petition or otherwise challenging the jurisdiction of the regional board of school trustees to conduct a hearing on a petition and except for motions and briefs related to the type of evidence the regional board of school trustees may consider under subsection (i) of this Section, no other motions, pleadings, briefs, discovery requests, or other like documents may be filed with the regional board of school trustees or served on other parties, and the regional board of school trustees shall have no authority to consider such documents, except that if a legal issue arises during a hearing, then the regional board of school trustees may, at its discretion, request briefs to be submitted to it on that issue.
    (i) The regional board of school trustees shall hear evidence as to the school needs and conditions of the territory in the area within and adjacent thereto and the effect detachment will have on those needs and conditions and as to the ability of the detaching or dissolving and annexing school districts to meet the standards of recognition as prescribed by the State Board of Education, shall take into consideration the division of funds and assets that will result from the change of boundaries, and shall determine whether it is in the best interests of the schools of the area and the direct educational welfare of the pupils that such change in boundaries be granted. If non-high school territory is contained in the petition, the normal high school attendance pattern of the pupils must be taken into consideration. However, upon resolution by the regional board of school trustees, the secretary thereof shall conduct the hearing upon any boundary petition and present a transcript of such hearing to the trustees, who shall base their decision upon the transcript, maps, and information and any presentation of counsel. In the instance of a change of boundaries through detachment:
        (1) When considering the effect the detachment will
    	
have on the direct educational welfare of the pupils, the regional board of school trustees shall consider a comparison of the school report cards for the schools of the detaching and annexing districts and the school district report cards for the detaching and annexing districts only if there is no more than a 3% difference in the minority, low-income, and English learner student populations of the relevant schools of the districts.
        (2) The community of interest of the petitioners and
    	
their children and the effect detachment will have on the whole child may be considered only if the regional board of school trustees first determines that there would be a significant direct educational benefit to the petitioners' children if the change in boundaries were allowed.
        (3) When petitioners cite an annexing district
    	
attendance center or centers in the petition or during testimony, the regional board of school trustees may consider the difference in the distances from the detaching area to the current attendance centers and the cited annexing district attendance centers only if the difference is no less than 10 miles shorter to one of the cited annexing district attendance centers than it is to the corresponding current attendance center.
        (4) The regional board of school trustees may not
    	
grant a petition if doing so will increase the percentage of minority or low-income students or English learners by more than 3% at the attendance center where students in the detaching territory currently attend, provided that if the percentage of any one of those groups also decreases at that attendance center, the regional board may grant the petition upon consideration of other factors under this Section and this Article.
        (5) The regional board of school trustees may not
    	
consider whether changing the boundaries will increase the property values of the petitioners' property.
    The factors in subdivisions (1) through (5) of this subsection (i) are applicable whether or not there are children residing in the petitioning area at the time the hearing is conducted.
    If the regional board of school trustees grants a petition to change school district boundaries, then the annexing school district shall determine the attendance center or centers that children from the petitioning area shall attend.
    (j) At the hearing, any resident in any detaching, dissolving, or annexing school district or any representative of a detaching, dissolving, or annexing school district may appear in person or by an attorney in support of the petition or to object to the granting of the petition and may present evidence in support of his or her position through either oral or written testimony.
    (k) At the conclusion of the hearing, the regional superintendent of schools as secretary to the regional board of school trustees shall, within 30 days, enter an order either granting or denying the petition. The regional superintendent of schools shall deliver a certified copy of the order by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the petitioners or committee of petitioners, as applicable; the president of the school board of each detaching or dissolving and annexing district; any person providing testimony in support of or opposition to the petition at the hearing; and any attorney who appears for a person. The regional superintendent of schools shall also deliver a copy of the order to the regional superintendent of schools who has supervision and control, as defined in Section 3-14.2 of this Code, of the annexing district if different from the regional superintendent of schools with whom the petition was filed. The regional superintendent of schools is not required to send a copy of the regional board of school trustees' order to those attending the hearing but not participating. The final order shall be in writing and include findings of fact, conclusions of law, and the decision to grant or deny the petition.
    (l) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section, if within 12 months after a petition is submitted under the provisions of Section 7-1 of this Code the petition is not approved or denied by the regional board of school trustees and the order approving or denying that petition entered and a copy thereof served as provided in this Section, petitioners may submit a copy of the petition directly to the State Superintendent of Education for approval or denial. The copy of the petition as so submitted shall be accompanied by a record of all proceedings had with respect to the petition up to the time the copy of the petition is submitted to the State Superintendent of Education (including a copy of any notice given or published, any certificate or other proof of publication, copies of any maps or written report of the financial and educational conditions of the school districts affected if furnished by the secretary of the regional board of school trustees, copies of any amendments to the petition and stipulations made, accepted or refused, a transcript of any hearing or part of a hearing held, continued or adjourned on the petition, and any orders entered with respect to the petition or any hearing held thereon). The petitioners submitting the petition and record of proceedings to the State Superintendent of Education shall give written notice by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the regional board of school trustees and to the secretary of that board and to the detaching or dissolving and annexing school districts that the petition has been submitted to the State Superintendent of Education for approval or denial and shall furnish a copy of the notice so given to the State Superintendent of Education. The cost of assembling the record of proceedings for submission to the State Superintendent of Education shall be the responsibility of the petitioners that submit the petition and record of proceedings to the State Superintendent of Education. When a petition is submitted to the State Superintendent of Education in accordance with the provisions of this paragraph:
        (1) The regional board of school trustees loses all
    	
jurisdiction over the petition and shall have no further authority to hear, approve, deny or otherwise act with respect to the petition.
        (2) All jurisdiction over the petition and the right
    	
and duty to hear, approve, deny or otherwise act with respect to the petition is transferred to and shall be assumed and exercised by the State Superintendent of Education.
        (3) The State Superintendent of Education shall not
    	
be required to repeat any proceedings that were conducted in accordance with the provisions of this Section prior to the time jurisdiction over the petition is transferred to him, but the State Superintendent of Education shall be required to give and publish any notices and hold or complete any hearings that were not given, held or completed by the regional board of school trustees or its secretary as required by this Section prior to the time jurisdiction over the petition is transferred to the State Superintendent of Education.
        (4) If so directed by the State Superintendent of
    	
Education, the regional superintendent of schools shall submit to the State Superintendent of Education and to such school boards as the State Superintendent of Education shall prescribe accurate maps and a written report of the financial and educational conditions of the districts affected and the probable effect of the proposed boundary changes.
        (5) The State Superintendent is authorized to conduct
    	
further hearings, or appoint a hearing officer to conduct further hearings, on the petition even though a hearing thereon was held as provided in this Section prior to the time jurisdiction over the petition is transferred to the State Superintendent of Education.
        (6) The State Superintendent of Education or the
    	
hearing officer shall hear evidence and approve or deny the petition and shall enter an order to that effect and deliver and serve the same as required in other cases to be done by the regional board of school trustees and the regional superintendent of schools as secretary of that board.
    (m) (Blank).
    (n) Within 10 days after service of a copy of the order granting or denying the petition, any person so served may petition for a rehearing. The petition for rehearing shall specify the reason for the request. The regional board of school trustees shall first determine whether there is sufficient cause for a rehearing. If so determined, then the regional board of school trustees shall allow the petition to be heard anew in its entirety in accordance with all procedures in this Article. The party requesting a rehearing shall pay the expenses of publishing the notice and of any transcript taken at the hearing. The filing of a petition for rehearing shall operate as a stay of enforcement until the regional board of school trustees or State Superintendent of Education in cases determined under subsection (l) of this Section enters the final order on such petition for rehearing.
    (o) If a petition is required under the provisions of subsection (b-5) of this Section to request submission of a proposition at a regular scheduled election for the purpose of voting for or against the annexation of the territory described in the petition to the school district proposing to annex that territory, and if the petition is granted or approved by the regional board of school trustees or by the State Superintendent of Education, the proposition shall be placed on the ballot at the next regular scheduled election.

    Sec. 7-10.5. Teacher transfer. When dissolution and annexation become effective for purposes of administration and attendance as determined pursuant to Section 7-9 or 7-11 of this Code, as applicable, the positions of teachers in contractual continued service in the district being dissolved are transferred to an annexing district or to annexing districts pursuant to the provisions of subsection (h) of Section 24-11 of this Code relative to teachers having contractual continued service status whose positions are transferred from one school board to the control of a different school board, and those said provisions of subsection (h) of Section 24-11 of this Code shall apply to the transferred teachers. In the event that the territory is added to 2 or more districts, the decision on which positions are to be transferred to which annexing districts must be made giving consideration to the proportionate percentage of pupils transferred and the annexing districts' staffing needs, and the transfer of specific individuals into such positions must be based upon the request of those teachers in order of seniority in the dissolving district. The contractual continued service status of any teacher thereby transferred to an annexing district is not lost and the different school board is subject to this Code with respect to the transferred teacher in the same manner as if the teacher was that district's employee and had been its employee during the time the teacher was actually employed by the school board of the dissolving district from which the position was transferred.

    (105 ILCS 5/7-11) (from Ch. 122, par. 7-11)
    Sec. 7-11. Annexation of dissolved non-operating districts. If any school district has become dissolved as provided in Section 5-32 of this Code, or if a petition for dissolution is filed under Section 7-2a of this Code, the regional board of school trustees shall attach the territory of such dissolved district to one or more districts and, if the territory is added to 2 or more districts, shall divide the property of the dissolved district among the districts to which its territory is added, in the manner provided for the division of property in case of the organization of a new district from a part of another district. The regional board of school trustees of the region in which the regional superintendent has supervision and control, as defined in Section 3-14.2 of this Code, over the school district that is dissolved shall have all power necessary to annex the territory of the dissolved district as provided in this Section, including the power to attach the territory to a school district under the supervision and control of the regional superintendent of another educational service region and, in the case of Leepertown CCSD 175, the power to attach the territory to a non-contiguous school district if deemed in the best interests of the schools of the area and the educational welfare of the pupils involved. The annexation of the territory of a dissolved school district under this Section shall entitle the school districts involved in the annexation to payments from the State Board of Education in the same manner and to the same extent authorized in the case of other annexations under this Article. Other provisions of this Article 7 of this Code shall apply to and govern dissolutions and annexations under this Section and Section 7-2a of this Code, except that it is the intent of the General Assembly that in the case of conflict the provisions of this Section and Section 7-2a of this Code shall control over the other provisions of this Article.
    The regional board of school trustees shall give notice of a hearing, to be held not less than 50 days nor more than 70 days after a school district is dissolved under Section 5-32 of this Code or a petition is filed under Section 7-2a of this Code, on the disposition of the territory of such school district by publishing a notice thereof at least once each week for 2 successive weeks in at least one newspaper having a general circulation within the area of the territory involved. At such hearing, the regional board of school trustees shall hear evidence as to the school needs and conditions of the territory and of the area within and adjacent thereto, and shall take into consideration the educational welfare of the pupils of the territory and the normal high school attendance pattern of the children. In the case of an elementary school district, except for Leepertown CCSD 175, if all the eighth grade graduates of such district customarily attend high school in the same high school district, the regional board of school trustees shall, unless it be impossible because of the restrictions of a special charter district, annex the territory of the district to a contiguous elementary school district whose eighth grade graduates customarily attend that high school, and that has an elementary school building nearest to the center of the territory to be annexed, but if such eighth grade graduates customarily attend more than one high school the regional board of school trustees shall determine the attendance pattern of such graduates and divide the territory of the district among the contiguous elementary districts whose graduates attend the same respective high schools.
    At the conclusion of the hearing, the regional superintendent of schools, as secretary to the regional board of school trustees, shall, within 10 days, enter an order detailing the annexation of the dissolved district. The regional superintendent of schools shall deliver a certified copy of the order by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the petitioners or committee of petitioners, as applicable; the president of the school board of each dissolving and annexing district; any person providing testimony in support of or opposition to the petition at the hearing; and any attorney who appears for any person. The regional superintendent of schools shall also deliver a copy of the order to the regional superintendent of schools who has supervision and control, as defined in Section 3-14.2 of this Code, of the annexing district, if different from the regional superintendent of schools with whom the petition was filed. The regional superintendent of schools is not required to send a copy of the regional board of school trustees' order to those attending the hearing but not participating. The final order shall be in writing and include findings of fact, conclusions of law, and the annexation decision. The decision of the regional board of school trustees shall be deemed an "administrative decision" as defined in Section 3-101 of the Code of Civil Procedure, and any resident, petitioner, or school board entitled to receive a certified copy of the regional board of school trustees' order may, within 10 days after a copy of the decision sought to be reviewed was served by certified mail, return receipt requested, upon the resident, petitioner, or school board, thereby file a complaint for the judicial review of such decision in accordance with the Administrative Review Law and the rules adopted pursuant thereto. The commencement of any action for review shall operate as a stay of enforcement, and no further proceedings shall be had until final disposition of such review. The final decision of the regional board of school trustees or of any court upon judicial review shall become effective under Section 7-9 of this Code in the case of a petition for dissolution filed under Section 7-2a of this Code, and a final decision shall become effective immediately following the date no further appeal is allowable in the case of a district dissolved under Section 5-32 of this Code.
    Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section or any other provision of law to the contrary, the school board of the Mt. Morris School District is authorized to donate to the City of Mount Morris, Illinois the school building and other real property used as a school site by the Mt. Morris School District at the time of its dissolution, by appropriate resolution adopted by the school board of the district prior to the dissolution of the district; and upon the adoption of a resolution by the school board donating the school building and school site to the City of Mount Morris, Illinois as authorized by this Section, the regional board of school trustees or other school officials holding legal title to the school building and school site so donated shall immediately convey the same to the City of Mt. Morris, Illinois.

The annexing district as it is constituted on and after the time of such annexation shall receive all the assets and assume all the obligations and liabilities including the bonded indebtedness of the original annexing district and of the district annexed.

    Sec. 7-14. Bonded indebtedness-Tax rate.
    (a) Beginning on January 1, 2015, whenever the boundaries of any school district are changed by the attachment or detachment of territory, the territory that is detached shall remain liable for its proportionate share of the bonded indebtedness of the school district from which the territory is detached. The annexing district shall not, except pursuant to the approval of a resolution by the school board of the annexing district prior to the effective date of the change of boundaries, assume or be responsible for any of the bonded indebtedness of the district from which the territory is detached. If the annexing district does not assume the detaching territory's proportionate share of the bonded indebtedness of the district from which the territory is detaching, a tax rate for that bonded indebtedness shall be determined in the manner provided in Section 19-7 of this Code, and the county clerk or clerks shall annually extend taxes for each bond outstanding on the effective date of the change of boundaries against all of the taxable property situated within the territory that is detached and within the detaching district. After the effective date of the change of boundaries, all of the property situated within the annexing school district, including the detaching territory, shall be liable for the bonded indebtedness of that district as it exists on the effective date of the change of boundaries and any date thereafter.
    (b) Whenever a school district with bonded indebtedness has become dissolved under this Article and its territory annexed to another district, the annexing district or districts shall not, except by action pursuant to resolution of the school board of the annexing district prior to the effective date of the annexation, assume the bonded indebtedness of the dissolved district; nor, except by action pursuant to resolution of the school board of the dissolving district, shall the territory of the dissolved district assume the bonded indebtedness of the annexing district or districts. If the annexing district or districts do not assume the bonded indebtedness of the dissolved district, a tax rate for the bonded indebtedness shall be determined in the manner provided in Section 19-7, and the county clerk or clerks shall annually extend taxes for each outstanding bond issue against all the taxable property that was situated within the boundaries of the district as the boundaries existed at the time of the issuance of each bond issue regardless of whether the property is still contained in that same district at the time of the extension of the taxes by the county clerk or clerks.
    (c) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 19-18 of this Code, upon resolution of the school board, the county clerk must extend taxes to pay the principal of and interest on any bonds issued exclusively to refund any bonded indebtedness of the annexing school district against all of the taxable property that was situated within the boundaries of the annexing district as the boundaries existed at the time of the issuance of the bonded indebtedness being refunded and not against any of the taxable property in the dissolved school district, provided that (i) the net interest rate on the refunding bonds may not exceed the net interest rate on the refunded bonds, (ii) the final maturity date of the refunding bonds may not extend beyond the final maturity date of the refunded bonds, and (iii) the tax levy to pay the refunding bonds in any levy year may not exceed the tax levy that would have been required to pay the refunded bonds for that levy year. The provisions of this subsection (c) are applicable to school districts that were dissolved and their territory annexed to another school district pursuant to a referendum held in April of 2003. The provisions of this subsection (c), other than this sentence, are inoperative 2 years after the effective date of this amendatory Act of the 95th General Assembly.

There shall be no accounting made after a mere change in boundaries when no new district is created, except that those districts whose enrollment increases by 90% or more as a result of annexing territory detached from another district pursuant to this Article are eligible for supplementary State aid payments in accordance with Section 11E-135 of this Code. Eligible annexing districts shall apply to the State Board of Education for supplementary State aid payments by submitting enrollment figures for the year immediately preceding and the year immediately following the effective date of the boundary change for both the district gaining territory and the district losing territory. Copies of any intergovernmental agreements between the district gaining territory and the district losing territory detailing any transfer of fund balances and staff must also be submitted. In all instances of changes in boundaries, the district losing territory shall not count the average daily attendance of pupils living in the territory during the year preceding the effective date of the boundary change in its claim for reimbursement under Section 18-8.05 or 18-8.15 of this Code for the school year following the effective date of the change in boundaries and the district receiving the territory shall count the average daily attendance of pupils living in the territory during the year preceding the effective date of the boundary change in its claim for reimbursement under Section 18-8.05 or 18-8.15 of this Code for the school year following the effective date of the change in boundaries. The changes to this Section made by this amendatory Act of the 95th General Assembly are intended to be retroactive and applicable to any annexation taking effect on or after July 1, 2004.

An appointed treasurer shall serve at the pleasure of the board. An appointed treasurer shall be at least 21 years of age, of approved integrity, but not a member of the county board of school trustees.

The school board shall fix the compensation of its school treasurer, and for sufficient cause may remove the school treasurer from office. However, if a member of the school board is also school treasurer, he or she shall perform his or her duties as school treasurer without compensation. In the case of a vacancy, the school board shall appoint a school treasurer for the unexpired term. The school board may determine the temporary incapacity of its treasurer due to illness, absence from the district, or other cause that prevents the prompt performance of his duties and may appoint an acting treasurer to serve until the school board determines that the temporary incapacity of its treasurer no longer exists.
    (d) After October 1, 1977, each treasurer in a Class I county school unit appointed under this Section for his first term shall have a financial background or related experience or 12 semester hours of credit of college level accounting.

Experience as a township treasurer in a Class II county school unit prior to July 1, 1989 shall be deemed the equivalent of certification.
    (f) Concurrently with the election or appointment of its own school treasurer by the school board of a school district which forms a part of a Class II county school unit but which no longer is subject to the jurisdiction and authority of a township treasurer or trustees of schools of a township because the district has withdrawn from the jurisdiction and authority of the township treasurer and trustees of schools of the township or because those offices have been abolished as provided in subsection (b) or (c) of Section 5-1, all funds, accounts, moneys, notes, bonds, mortgages and effects then held by such township treasurer on behalf or for the use and benefit of, or then credited by such township treasurer to any fund or account of such school district shall thereupon be transferred and paid over by such township treasurer to the school treasurer elected or appointed by the school board of such school district. In addition the school treasurer of such school district shall have the right, at all reasonable times, to inspect all cash books, loan books, district account books and journals kept by such township treasurer as provided in Section 8-5 and to copy or otherwise reproduce such portions thereof as such school treasurer deems necessary for the performance of his duties.
    (g) Upon the abolition of the offices of the township treasurer and trustee of schools of a township as provided in subsection (c) of Section 5-1, and subject to the limitation of subsection (b) of Section 8-5 with respect to certain records to be surrendered to the regional board of school trustees, and except as otherwise provided in subsection (c) of Section 5-1 with respect to the common school lands and township loanable funds of that township and with respect to the records, books and accounts relating to those common school lands and township loanable funds, all school funds and accounts, moneys, notes, bonds, securities, district account books and other documents, records and effects then held by the former township treasurer on behalf or for the use and benefit of, or then credited by the former township treasurer to any fund or account of any school district that was under the jurisdiction and authority of the township treasurer at the time the office of that township treasurer was abolished shall thereupon be transferred and paid over by the former township treasurer to the appropriate school treasurer appointed by the school board of each such district under subsection (c) of this Section 8-1.
    (h) If the school district of a school treasurer elected or appointed under this Section is receiving emergency State financial assistance under Article 1B, that school treasurer is subject to the provisions of Article 1B.

    To the (County Clerk or County Board of Election Commissioners) .... of .... County:
    We the undersigned, being (.... or more) (or 10% or more) (or 5% or more) of the voters residing within said district, hereby petition that .... who resides at .... in the (city or village) of .... in Township .... (or who resides outside any city, village or incorporated town and in Township ....) in said district shall be a candidate for the office of .... of the board of education (or board of directors) (full term) (vacancy) to be voted for at the election to be held on (insert date).
    Name: .................. Address: ...................
 
    In the designation of the name of a candidate on a petition for nomination, the candidate's given name or names, initial or initials, a nickname by which the candidate is commonly known, or a combination thereof may be used in addition to the candidate's surname. If a candidate has changed his or her name, whether by a statutory or common law procedure in Illinois or any other jurisdiction, within 3 years before the last day for filing the petition, then (i) the candidate's name on the petition must be followed by "formerly known as (list all prior names during the 3-year period) until name changed on (list date of each such name change)" and (ii) the petition must be accompanied by the candidate's affidavit stating the candidate's previous names during the period specified in clause (i) and the date or dates each of those names was changed; failure to meet these requirements shall be grounds for denying certification of the candidate's name for the ballot, but these requirements do not apply to name changes resulting from adoption to assume an adoptive parent's or parents' surname, marriage to assume a spouse's surname, or dissolution of marriage or declaration of invalidity of marriage to assume a former surname. No other designation, such as a political slogan, as defined by Section 7-17 of the Election Code, title or degree, or nickname suggesting or implying possession of a title, degree or professional status, or similar information may be used in connection with the candidate's surname.
    Nomination papers filed under this Section are not valid unless the candidate named therein files with the county clerk or the county board of election commissioners, as the case may be, of the county in which the principal office of the school district is located a receipt from the county clerk showing that the candidate has filed a statement of economic interests as required by the Illinois Governmental Ethics Act. Such receipt shall be so filed either previously during the calendar year in which his nomination papers were filed or within the period for the filing of nomination papers in accordance with the general election law.
    All petitions for the nomination of members of a board of education shall be filed with the county clerk or the county board of election commissioners, as the case may be, of the county in which the principal office of the school district is located within the time provided for by the general election law. The county clerk or the county board of election commissioners may have petition forms available for issuance to potential candidates, and may give notice of the petition filing period by publication in a newspaper of general circulation within the school district not less than 10 days prior to the first day of filing. The county clerk or the county board of election commissioners shall make certification to the proper election authorities in accordance with the general election law.
    The county clerk or the county board of election commissioners, as the case may be, of the county in which the principal office of the school district is located shall notify the candidates for whom a petition for nomination is filed or the appropriate committee of the obligations under the Campaign Financing Act as provided in the general election law. Such notice shall be given on a form prescribed by the State Board of Elections and in accordance with the requirements of the general election law. The county clerk or county board of election commissioners shall within 7 days of filing or on the last day for filing, whichever is earlier, acknowledge to the petitioner in writing the office's acceptance of the petition.
    A candidate for membership on the board of education or for office as a school director, who has petitioned for nomination to fill a full term and to fill a vacant term to be voted upon at the same election, must withdraw his or her petition for nomination from either the full term or the vacant term by written declaration.
    In all newly organized districts the petition for the nomination of candidates for members of the board of education at the first election shall be addressed to and filed with the regional superintendent of schools in the manner herein specified for the petitions for members of a board of education.

The county clerk or the board of election commissioners, as the case may be, of the jurisdiction in which the principal office of the school district is located shall conduct a lottery to determine the ballot order of candidates for full terms in the event of any simultaneous petition filings. Such candidate lottery shall be conducted as follows:
    All petitions filed by persons waiting in line as of 8:00 a.m. on the first day for filing, or as of the normal opening hour of the office involved on such day, shall be deemed simultaneously filed as of 8:00 a.m. or the normal opening hour, as the case may be. Petitions filed by mail and received after midnight of the first day for filing and in the first mail delivery or pickup of that day shall be deemed simultaneously filed as of 8:00 a.m. of that day or as of the normal opening hour of such day, as the case may be. All petitions received thereafter shall be deemed filed in the order of actual receipt. However, 2 or more petitions filed within the last hour of the filing deadline shall be deemed filed simultaneously.
    Where 2 or more petitions are received simultaneously for the same office as of 8:00 a.m. on the first day for petition filing, or as of the normal opening hour of the office of the county clerk or the board of election commissioners, as the case may be, the county clerk or the board of election commissioners with whom such petitions are filed shall break ties and determine the order of filing by means of a lottery or other fair and impartial method of random selection. Such lottery shall be conducted within 9 days following the last day for petition filing and shall be open to the public. Seven days written notice of the time and place of conducting such random selection shall be given by the county clerk or the board of election commissioners to all candidates who filed their petitions simultaneously and to each organization of citizens within the election jurisdiction which was entitled, under the general election law, at the next preceding election, to have pollwatchers present on the day of election. The county clerk or the board of election commissioners shall post in a conspicuous, open and public place, at the entrance of his or her office, notice of the time and place of such lottery.
    All candidates shall be certified in the order in which their petitions have been filed and in the manner prescribed by Section 10-15 of the general election law. Where candidates have filed simultaneously, they shall be certified in the order prescribed by this Section and prior to candidates who filed for the same office at a later time.
    Where elections are conducted for unexpired terms, a second lottery to determine ballot order shall be conducted for candidates who simultaneously file petitions for such unexpired terms. Such lottery shall be conducted in the same manner as prescribed by this Section for full term candidates.

    The area of residence of the candidate determined to be first by order of petition filing or by lottery shall be listed first among the candidate groupings on the ballot. All other candidates from the same area of residence will follow according to order of petition filing or the lottery. The area of residence of the candidate determined to be second by the order of petition filing or the lottery shall be listed second among the candidate groupings on the ballot. All other candidates from the same area of residence will follow according to the order of petition filing or the lottery. The ballot order of additional candidate groupings by area of residence shall be established in a like manner.
    In any school district that elects its board members according to area of residence and that has one or more unexpired terms to be filled at an election, the winner or winners of the unexpired term or terms shall be determined first and independently of those running for full terms. The winners of the full terms shall then be determined taking into consideration the areas of residence of those elected to fill the unexpired term or terms.
    "Area of Residence" means congressional township and incorporated and unincorporated territories.
    "Affected school district" means either of the 2 entire elementary school districts that are formed into a combined school district.

    Sec. 9-22. School board districts; changing manner of election. A school board may by resolution or shall, upon the petition of the lesser of 2,500 or 5% of the district's registered voters, order submitted to the district's voters at a regular school election or at the general election, the proposition for the election of board members by school board district, and the proposition shall thereupon be certified by the board's secretary for submission. If the proposition is approved by a majority of those voting on the proposition, the board shall divide the school district into 7 school board districts, each of which must be compact and contiguous and substantially equal in population to each other district. The terms of office of the board members incumbent at the time the proposition is adopted expire on the day of the next regular school election, at which time one member shall be elected from each school board district. In districts which have 4 year terms, those members first elected after adoption of such a proposition shall, by lot, determine 3 to serve for 2 years and 4 for 4 years; their successors shall serve for a 4 year term. In districts which have 6 year terms, those members first elected after adoption of such a proposition shall, by lot, determine 3 to serve for 2 years, 2 for 4 years and 2 for 6 years; their successors shall serve for a 6 year term. Vacancies shall be filled as provided in Section 10-10.
    In the year following each decennial census, the school board shall reapportion the board districts to reflect the results of such census; provided, that no decennial reapportionment shall be required in any school district which elects its board members by school board district rather than at large if: (i) on the effective date of this amendatory Act of 1990, such school district last elected its board members by school board district at the nonpartisan election in 1989; (ii) the terms of the board members so elected were determined by lot after that election and prior to January 1, 1990; and (iii) the population of each existing school board district in that school district at the time of the decennial census is within 5% of what would be the population in the corresponding school board district that would result were the school board districts in that school district to be reapportioned following that decennial census as otherwise required by this paragraph. If reapportionment is required by this paragraph, the school board districts shall be compact, contiguous and substantially equal in population, and such reapportionment plan shall be completed and formally approved by a majority of the members of the board not less than 90 days before the last date established by law for the submission of nominating petitions for the next school board election. At the same board meeting, the board shall, publicly by lot, divide the board districts as equally as possible into 2 groups. In school districts which have 4 year terms, board members or their successors from one group shall be elected for successive terms of 2 years, 4 years and 4 years; and members or their successors from the second group shall be elected for successive terms of 4 years, 4 years and 2 years. In school districts which have 6 year terms, board members or their successors from one group shall be elected for successive terms of 4 years and 6 years; and members or their successors from the second group shall be elected for successive terms of 6 years and 4 years.
    In any school district in which the members of the school board are elected by school board district rather than at large, the school board may by resolution or shall, upon the petition of the lesser of 2,500 or 5% of the school district's registered voters, order submitted to the school district's voters at a regular school election or at the general election, the proposition for the election of board members at large rather than by school board district; and the proposition shall thereupon be certified by the board's secretary for submission. If a majority of those voting at the election in each school board district vote in favor of the proposition: (i) the proposition to elect board members at large shall be deemed to have passed, (ii) new members of the board shall be elected at large at the next regular school election, and (iii) the terms of office of the board members incumbent at the time the proposition is adopted shall expire when the new board members that are elected at large have organized in accordance with Section 10-16. In school districts that formerly elected their members by school board district to successive terms not exceeding 4 years, the members elected at large shall be elected for a term of 4 years, and in school districts that formerly elected their members by school board district to successive terms not exceeding 6 years, the members elected at large shall be elected for a term of 6 years; provided, that in each case the terms of the board members initially elected at large as provided in this paragraph shall be staggered and determined in accordance with the provisions of Sections 10-10 and 10-16.

    (105 ILCS 5/10-9) (from Ch. 122, par. 10-9)

    (a) No school board member shall be interested, directly or indirectly, in his own name or in the name of any other person, association, trust or corporation, in any contract, work or business of the district or in the sale of any article, whenever the expense, price or consideration of the contract, work, business or sale is paid either from the treasury or by any assessment levied by any statute or ordinance. A school board member shall not be deemed interested if the board member is an employee of a business that is involved in the transaction of business with the school district, provided that the board member has no financial interests other than as an employee. No school board member shall be interested, directly or indirectly, in the purchase of any property which (1) belongs to the district, or (2) is sold for taxes or assessments, or (3) is sold by virtue of legal process at the suit of the district.
    (b) However, any board member may provide materials, merchandise, property, services or labor, if:
        A. the contract is with a person, firm, partnership,
    	
association, corporation or cooperative association in which the board member has less than a 7 1/2% share in the ownership; and
        B. such interested board member publicly discloses
    	
the nature and extent of his interest prior to or during deliberations concerning the proposed award of the contract; and
        C. such interested board member abstains from voting
    	
on the award of the contract, though he shall be considered present for the purposes of establishing a quorum; and
        D. such contract is approved by a majority vote of
    	
those board members presently holding office; and
        E. the contract is awarded after sealed bids to the
    	
lowest responsible bidder if the amount of the contract exceeds $1500, or awarded without bidding if the amount of the contract is less than $1500; and
        F. the award of the contract would not cause the
    	
aggregate amount of all such contracts so awarded to the same person, firm, association, partnership, corporation or cooperative association in the same fiscal year to exceed $25,000.
    (c) In addition to the above exemption, any board member may provide materials, merchandise, property, services or labor if:
        A. the award of the contract is approved by a
    	
majority vote of the board provided that any such interested member shall abstain from voting; and
        B. the amount of the contract does not exceed $1,000;
    	
and
        C. the award of the contract would not cause the
    	
aggregate amount of all such contracts so awarded to the same person, firm, association, partnership, corporation, or cooperative association in the same fiscal year to exceed $2,000, except with respect to a board member of a school district in which the materials, merchandise, property, services, or labor to be provided under the contract are not available from any other person, firm, association, partnership, corporation, or cooperative association in the district, in which event the award of the contract shall not cause the aggregate amount of all contracts so awarded to that same person, firm, association, partnership, or cooperative association in the same fiscal year to exceed $5,000; and
        D. such interested member publicly discloses the
    	
nature and extent of his interest prior to or during deliberations concerning the proposed award of the contract; and
        E. such interested member abstains from voting on the
    	
award of the contract, though he shall be considered present for the purposes of establishing a quorum.
    (d) In addition to exemptions otherwise authorized by this Section, any board member may purchase for use as the board member's primary place of residence a house constructed by the district's vocational education students on the same basis that any other person would be entitled to purchase the property. The sale of the house by the district must comply with the requirements set forth in Section 5-22 of The School Code.
    (e) A contract for the procurement of public utility services by a district with a public utility company is not barred by this Section by one or more members of the board being an officer or employee of the public utility company or holding an ownership interest of no more than 7 1/2% in the public utility company, or holding an ownership interest of any size if the school district has a population of less than 7,500 and the public utility's rates are approved by the Illinois Commerce Commission. An elected or appointed member of the board having such an interest shall be deemed not to have a prohibited interest under this Section.
    (f) Nothing contained in this Section, including the restrictions set forth in subsections (b), (c), (d) and (e), shall preclude a contract of deposit of monies, loans or other financial services by a school district with a local bank or local savings and loan association, regardless of whether a member or members of the governing body of the school district are interested in such bank or savings and loan association as an officer or employee or as a holder of less than 7 1/2% of the total ownership interest. A member or members holding such an interest in such a contract shall not be deemed to be holding a prohibited interest for purposes of this Act. Such interested member or members of the governing body must publicly state the nature and extent of their interest during deliberations concerning the proposed award of such a contract, but shall not participate in any further deliberations concerning the proposed award. Such interested member or members shall not vote on such a proposed award. Any member or members abstaining from participation in deliberations and voting under this Section may be considered present for purposes of establishing a quorum. Award of such a contract shall require approval by a majority vote of those members presently holding office. Consideration and award of any such contract in which a member or members are interested may only be made at a regularly scheduled public meeting of the governing body of the school district.
    (g) Any school board member who violates this Section is guilty of a Class 4 felony and in addition thereto any office held by such person so convicted shall become vacant and shall be so declared as part of the judgment of the court.

If at the regular school election held in the first odd-numbered year after the determination to elect members for a 6 year term 5 members are elected, 3 shall serve for a term of 6 years and 2 shall serve for a term of 2 years; and of the members elected at the next regular school election 2 shall serve for terms of 6 years and 2 shall serve for terms of 2 years. Thereafter members elected in such districts shall be elected to a 6 year term. An election for board members shall not be held in school districts which by consolidation, annexation or otherwise shall cease to exist as a school district within 6 months after the election date, and the term of all board members which would otherwise terminate shall be continued until such district shall cease to exist. Each member, on the date of his or her election, shall be a citizen of the United States of the age of 18 years or over, shall be a resident of the State and the territory of the district for at least one year immediately preceding his or her election, shall be a registered voter as provided in the general election law, shall not be a school trustee, must not have been removed from a school board pursuant to Section 2-3.25f-5 of this Code (unless subsequently appointed as a member of an Independent Authority or if it has been 10 years since the abolition of the Independent Authority in the district), and shall not be a child sex offender as defined in Section 11-9.3 of the Criminal Code of 2012. When the board of education is the successor of the school directors, all rights of property, and all rights regarding causes of action existing or vested in such directors, shall vest in it as fully as they were vested in the school directors. Terms of members are subject to Section 2A-54 of the Election Code.
    Nomination papers filed under this Section are not valid unless the candidate named therein files with the county clerk or the county board of election commissioners, as the case may be, of the county in which the principal office of the school district is located a receipt from the county clerk showing that the candidate has filed a statement of economic interests as required by the Illinois Governmental Ethics Act. Such receipt shall be so filed either previously during the calendar year in which his nomination papers were filed or within the period for the filing of nomination papers in accordance with the general election law.
    Whenever a vacancy occurs, the remaining members shall notify the regional superintendent of that vacancy within 5 days after its occurrence and shall proceed to fill the vacancy until the next regular school election, at which election a successor shall be elected to serve the remainder of the unexpired term. However, if the vacancy occurs with less than 868 days remaining in the term, or if the vacancy occurs less than 88 days before the next regularly scheduled election for this office then the person so appointed shall serve the remainder of the unexpired term, and no election to fill the vacancy shall be held. Should they fail so to act, within 60 days after the vacancy occurs, the regional superintendent of schools under whose supervision and control the district is operating, as defined in Section 3-14.2 of this Act, shall within 30 days after the remaining members have failed to fill the vacancy, fill the vacancy as provided for herein. Upon the regional superintendent's failure to fill the vacancy, the vacancy shall be filled at the next regularly scheduled election. Whether elected or appointed by the remaining members or regional superintendent, the successor shall be an inhabitant of the particular area from which his or her predecessor was elected if the residential requirements contained in Section 10-10.5 or 12-2 of this Code apply.
    A board of education may appoint a student to the board to serve in an advisory capacity. The student member shall serve for a term as determined by the board. The board may not grant the student member any voting privileges, but shall consider the student member as an advisor. The student member may not participate in or attend any executive session of the board.

    (105 ILCS 5/10-19) (from Ch. 122, par. 10-19)
    Sec. 10-19. Length of school term - experimental programs. Each school board shall annually prepare a calendar for the school term, specifying the opening and closing dates and providing a minimum term of at least 185 days to insure 176 days of actual pupil attendance, computable under Section 10-19.05, except that for the 1980-1981 school year only 175 days of actual pupil attendance shall be required because of the closing of schools pursuant to Section 24-2 on January 29, 1981 upon the appointment by the President of that day as a day of thanksgiving for the freedom of the Americans who had been held hostage in Iran. Any days allowed by law for teachers' institutes but not used as such or used as parental institutes as provided in Section 10-22.18d shall increase the minimum term by the school days not so used. Except as provided in Section 10-19.1, the board may not extend the school term beyond such closing date unless that extension of term is necessary to provide the minimum number of computable days. In case of such necessary extension school employees shall be paid for such additional time on the basis of their regular contracts. A school board may specify a closing date earlier than that set on the annual calendar when the schools of the district have provided the minimum number of computable days under this Section. Nothing in this Section prevents the board from employing superintendents of schools, principals and other nonteaching personnel for a period of 12 months, or in the case of superintendents for a period in accordance with Section 10-23.8, or prevents the board from employing other personnel before or after the regular school term with payment of salary proportionate to that received for comparable work during the school term. Remote learning days, blended remote learning days, and up to 5 remote and blended remote learning planning days established under Section 10-30 or 34-18.66 shall be deemed pupil attendance days for calculation of the length of a school term under this Section.
    A school board may make such changes in its calendar for the school term as may be required by any changes in the legal school holidays prescribed in Section 24-2. A school board may make changes in its calendar for the school term as may be necessary to reflect the utilization of teachers' institute days as parental institute days as provided in Section 10-22.18d.
    The calendar for the school term and any changes must be submitted to and approved by the regional superintendent of schools before the calendar or changes may take effect.
    With the prior approval of the State Board of Education and subject to review by the State Board of Education every 3 years, any school board may, by resolution of its board and in agreement with affected exclusive collective bargaining agents, establish experimental educational programs, including but not limited to programs for e-learning days as authorized under Section 10-20.56 of this Code, self-directed learning, or outside of formal class periods, which programs when so approved shall be considered to comply with the requirements of this Section as respects numbers of days of actual pupil attendance and with the other requirements of this Act as respects courses of instruction.

    (105 ILCS 5/10-19.05)
    Sec. 10-19.05. Daily pupil attendance calculation.
    (a) Except as otherwise provided in this Section, for a pupil of legal school age and in kindergarten or any of grades 1 through 12, a day of attendance shall be counted only for sessions of not less than 5 clock hours of school work per day under direct supervision of (i) teachers or (ii) non-teaching personnel or volunteer personnel when engaging in non-teaching duties and supervising in those instances specified in subsection (a) of Section 10-22.34 and paragraph 10 of Section 34-18. Days of attendance by pupils through verified participation in an e-learning program adopted by a school board and verified by the regional office of education or intermediate service center for the school district under Section 10-20.56 of this Code shall be considered as full days of attendance under this Section.
    (b) A pupil regularly enrolled in a public school for only a part of the school day may be counted on the basis of one-sixth of a school day for every class hour of instruction of 40 minutes or more attended pursuant to such enrollment, unless a pupil is enrolled in a block-schedule format of 80 minutes or more of instruction, in which case the pupil may be counted on the basis of the proportion of minutes of school work completed each day to the minimum number of minutes that school work is required to be held that day.
    (c) A session of 4 or more clock hours may be counted as a day of attendance upon certification by the regional superintendent of schools and approval by the State Superintendent of Education to the extent that the district has been forced to use daily multiple sessions.
    (d) A session of 3 or more clock hours may be counted as a day of attendance (1) when the remainder of the school day or at least 2 hours in the evening of that day is utilized for an in-service training program for teachers, up to a maximum of 10 days per school year, provided that a district conducts an in-service training program for teachers in accordance with Section 10-22.39 of this Code, or, in lieu of 4 such days, 2 full days may be used, in which event each such day may be counted as a day required for a legal school calendar pursuant to Section 10-19 of this Code; (2) when, of the 5 days allowed under item (1), a maximum of 4 days are used for parent-teacher conferences, or, in lieu of 4 such days, 2 full days are used, in which case each such day may be counted as a calendar day required under Section 10-19 of this Code, provided that the full-day, parent-teacher conference consists of (i) a minimum of 5 clock hours of parent-teacher conferences, (ii) both a minimum of 2 clock hours of parent-teacher conferences held in the evening following a full day of student attendance and a minimum of 3 clock hours of parent-teacher conferences held on the day immediately following evening parent-teacher conferences, or (iii) multiple parent-teacher conferences held in the evenings following full days of student attendance in which the time used for the parent-teacher conferences is equivalent to a minimum of 5 clock hours; and (3) when days in addition to those provided in items (1) and (2) are scheduled by a school pursuant to its school improvement plan adopted under Article 34 or its revised or amended school improvement plan adopted under Article 2, provided that (i) such sessions of 3 or more clock hours are scheduled to occur at regular intervals, (ii) the remainder of the school days in which such sessions occur are utilized for in-service training programs or other staff development activities for teachers, and (iii) a sufficient number of minutes of school work under the direct supervision of teachers are added to the school days between such regularly scheduled sessions to accumulate not less than the number of minutes by which such sessions of 3 or more clock hours fall short of 5 clock hours. Days scheduled for in-service training programs, staff development activities, or parent-teacher conferences may be scheduled separately for different grade levels and different attendance centers of the district.
    (e) A session of not less than one clock hour of teaching hospitalized or homebound pupils on-site or by telephone to the classroom may be counted as a half day of attendance; however, these pupils must receive 4 or more clock hours of instruction to be counted for a full day of attendance.
    (f) A session of at least 4 clock hours may be counted as a day of attendance for first grade pupils and pupils in full-day kindergartens, and a session of 2 or more hours may be counted as a half day of attendance by pupils in kindergartens that provide only half days of attendance.
    (g) For children with disabilities who are below the age of 6 years and who cannot attend 2 or more clock hours because of their disability or immaturity, a session of not less than one clock hour may be counted as a half day of attendance; however, for such children whose educational needs require a session of 4 or more clock hours, a session of at least 4 clock hours may be counted as a full day of attendance.
    (h) A recognized kindergarten that provides for only a half day of attendance by each pupil shall not have more than one half day of attendance counted in any one day. However, kindergartens may count 2 and a half days of attendance in any 5 consecutive school days. When a pupil attends such a kindergarten for 2 half days on any one school day, the pupil shall have the following day as a day absent from school, unless the school district obtains permission in writing from the State Superintendent of Education. Attendance at kindergartens that provide for a full day of attendance by each pupil shall be counted the same as attendance by first grade pupils. Only the first year of attendance in one kindergarten shall be counted, except in the case of children who entered the kindergarten in their fifth year whose educational development requires a second year of kindergarten as determined under rules of the State Board of Education.
    (i) On the days when the State's final accountability assessment is administered under subsection (c) of Section 2-3.64a-5 of this Code, the day of attendance for a pupil whose school day must be shortened to accommodate required testing procedures may be less than 5 clock hours and shall be counted toward the 176 days of actual pupil attendance required under Section 10-19 of this Code, provided that a sufficient number of minutes of school work in excess of 5 clock hours are first completed on other school days to compensate for the loss of school work on the examination days.
    (j) Pupils enrolled in a remote educational program established under Section 10-29 of this Code may be counted on the basis of a one-fifth day of attendance for every clock hour of instruction attended in the remote educational program, provided that, in any month, the school district may not claim for a student enrolled in a remote educational program more days of attendance than the maximum number of days of attendance the district can claim (i) for students enrolled in a building holding year-round classes if the student is classified as participating in the remote educational program on a year-round schedule or (ii) for students enrolled in a building not holding year-round classes if the student is not classified as participating in the remote educational program on a year-round schedule.
    (j-5) The clock hour requirements of subsections (a) through (j) of this Section do not apply if the Governor has declared a disaster due to a public health emergency pursuant to Section 7 of the Illinois Emergency Management Agency Act. The State Superintendent of Education may establish minimum clock hour requirements under Sections 10-30 and 34-18.66 if the Governor has declared a disaster due to a public health emergency pursuant to Section 7 of the Illinois Emergency Management Agency Act.
    (k) Pupil participation in any of the following activities shall be counted toward the calculation of clock hours of school work per day:
        (1) Instruction in a college course in which a
    	
student is dually enrolled for both high school credit and college credit.
        (2) Participation in a Supervised Career
    	
Development Experience, as defined in Section 10 of the Postsecondary and Workforce Readiness Act, in which student participation and learning outcomes are supervised by an educator licensed under Article 21B.
        (3) Participation in a youth apprenticeship, as
    	
jointly defined in rules of the State Board of Education and Department of Commerce and Economic Opportunity, in which student participation and outcomes are supervised by an educator licensed under Article 21B.
        (4) Participation in a blended learning program
    	
approved by the school district in which course content, student evaluation, and instructional methods are supervised by an educator licensed under Article 21B.

Any school district, including special charter districts, may, by resolution of its board, file an application with the State Board of Education and, if approved, receive funds for the purpose of conducting a study of the feasibility of operating one or more schools within the district on a full year school plan pursuant to Section 10-19.1. Such feasibility study shall include, but need not be limited to, the educational program, building and space needs, administrative and personnel costs, pupil distribution in the district, community attitudes and transportation costs. The Board of Education of any district which conducts a feasibility study pursuant to this Section shall submit a final report to the State Board of Education upon completion of the study or within one year after receipt of funds, whichever occurs first.
    School districts seeking State financial support to conduct feasibility studies shall file applications with the State Board of Education on forms provided by the State Board. The State Board of Education may grant or deny applications, in whole or in part, and provide the funds necessary to implement approved applications, provided that the total amount of funds necessary to implement approved applications does not exceed the annual appropriation for that purpose.
    If, based upon the results of a full year feasibility study, a school district determines that it will operate one or more schools within the district in accordance with Section 10-19.1, the State Board of Education may, pursuant to guidelines established by the State Board, reimburse such district for expenditures resulting from making such transition, provided that no expenditure shall be reimbursed which would have been incurred by a school district in the absence of a changeover to a full year school program.
    In the event any funds appropriated for transition reimbursement during any fiscal year are insufficient for that purpose, payment shall be made in the proportion that the total amount of such expenditures bears to the total amount of money available for payment.

    Sec. 10-20.12b. Residency; payment of tuition; hearing; criminal penalty.
    (a) For purposes of this Section:
        (1) The residence of a person who has legal custody
    	
of a pupil is deemed to be the residence of the pupil.
        (2) "Legal custody" means one of the following:
            (i) Custody exercised by a natural or adoptive
        	
parent with whom the pupil resides.
            (ii) Custody granted by order of a court of
        	
competent jurisdiction to a person with whom the pupil resides for reasons other than to have access to the educational programs of the district.
            (iii) Custody exercised under a statutory
        	
short-term guardianship, provided that within 60 days of the pupil's enrollment a court order is entered that establishes a permanent guardianship and grants custody to a person with whom the pupil resides for reasons other than to have access to the educational programs of the district.
            (iv) Custody exercised by an adult caretaker
        	
relative who is receiving aid under the Illinois Public Aid Code for the pupil who resides with that adult caretaker relative for purposes other than to have access to the educational programs of the district.
            (v) Custody exercised by an adult who
        	
demonstrates that, in fact, he or she has assumed and exercises legal responsibility for the pupil and provides the pupil with a regular fixed night-time abode for purposes other than to have access to the educational programs of the district.
    (a-5) If a pupil's change of residence is due to the military service obligation of a person who has legal custody of the pupil, then, upon the written request of the person having legal custody of the pupil, the residence of the pupil is deemed for all purposes relating to enrollment (including tuition, fees, and costs), for the duration of the custodian's military service obligation, to be the same as the residence of the pupil immediately before the change of residence caused by the military service obligation. A school district is not responsible for providing transportation to or from school for a pupil whose residence is determined under this subsection (a-5). School districts shall facilitate re-enrollment when necessary to comply with this subsection (a-5).
    (b) Except as otherwise provided under Section 10-22.5a, only resident pupils of a school district may attend the schools of the district without payment of the tuition required to be charged under Section 10-20.12a. However, children for whom the Guardianship Administrator of the Department of Children and Family Services has been appointed temporary custodian or guardian of the person of a child shall not be charged tuition as a nonresident pupil if the child was placed by the Department of Children and Family Services with a foster parent or placed in another type of child care facility and the foster parent or child care facility is located in a school district other than the child's former school district and it is determined by the Department of Children and Family Services to be in the child's best interest to maintain attendance at his or her former school district.
    (c) The provisions of this subsection do not apply in school districts having a population of 500,000 or more. If a school board in a school district with a population of less than 500,000 determines that a pupil who is attending school in the district on a tuition free basis is a nonresident of the district for whom tuition is required to be charged under Section 10-20.12a, the board shall notify the person who enrolled the pupil of the amount of the tuition charged under Section 10-20.12a that is due to the district for a nonresident pupil's attendance in the district's schools. The notice shall detail the specific reasons why the board believes that the pupil is a nonresident of the district and shall be given by certified mail, return receipt requested. Within 10 calendar days after receipt of the notice, the person who enrolled the pupil may request a hearing to review the determination of the school board. The request shall be sent by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the district superintendent. Within 10 calendar days after receipt of the request, the board shall notify, by certified mail, return receipt requested, the person requesting the hearing of the time and place of the hearing, which shall be held not less than 10 nor more than 20 calendar days after the notice of hearing is given. At least 3 calendar days prior to the hearing, each party shall disclose to the other party all written evidence and testimony that it may submit during the hearing and a list of witnesses that it may call to testify during the hearing. The hearing notice shall notify the person requesting the hearing that any written evidence and testimony or witnesses not disclosed to the other party at least 3 calendar days prior to the hearing are barred at the hearing without the consent of the other party. The board or a hearing officer designated by the board shall conduct the hearing. The board and the person who enrolled the pupil may be represented at the hearing by representatives of their choice. At the hearing, the person who enrolled the pupil shall have the burden of going forward with the evidence concerning the pupil's residency. If the hearing is conducted by a hearing officer, the hearing officer, within 5 calendar days after the conclusion of the hearing, shall send a written report of his or her findings by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the school board and to the person who enrolled the pupil. The person who enrolled the pupil may, within 5 calendar days after receiving the findings, file written objections to the findings with the school board by sending the objections by certified mail, return receipt requested, addressed to the district superintendent. Whether the hearing is conducted by the school board or a hearing officer, the school board shall, within 30 calendar days after the conclusion of the hearing, decide whether or not the pupil is a resident of the district and the amount of any tuition required to be charged under Section 10-20.12a as a result of the pupil's attendance in the schools of the district. The school board shall send a copy of its decision within 5 calendar days of its decision to the person who enrolled the pupil by certified mail, return receipt requested. This decision must inform the person who enrolled the pupil that he or she may, within 5 calendar days after receipt of the decision of the board, petition the regional superintendent of schools to review the decision. The decision must also include notification that, at the request of the person who enrolled the pupil, the pupil may continue attending the schools of the district pending the regional superintendent of schools' review of the board's decision but that tuition shall continue to be assessed under Section 10-20.12a of this Code during the review period and become due upon a final determination of the regional superintendent of schools that the student is a nonresident.
    Within 5 calendar days after receipt of the decision of the board pursuant to this subsection (c) of this Section, the person who enrolled the pupil may petition the regional superintendent of schools who exercises supervision and control of the board to review the board's decision. The petition must include the basis for the request and be sent by certified mail, return receipt requested, to both the regional superintendent of schools and the district superintendent.
    Within 5 calendar days after receipt of the petition, the board must deliver to the regional superintendent of schools the written decision of the board, any written evidence and testimony that was submitted by the parties during the hearing, a list of all witnesses that testified during the hearing, and any existing written minutes or transcript of the hearing or verbatim record of the hearing in the form of an audio or video recording documenting the hearing. The board may also provide the regional superintendent of schools and the petitioner with a written response to the petition. The regional superintendent of schools' review of the board's decision is limited to the documentation submitted to the regional superintendent of schools pursuant to this Section.
    Within 10 calendar days after receipt of the documentation provided by the school district pursuant to this Section, the regional superintendent of schools shall issue a written decision as to whether or not there is clear and convincing evidence that the pupil is a resident of the district pursuant to this Section and eligible to attend the district's schools on a tuition-free basis. The decision shall be transmitted to the board and the person who enrolled the pupil and shall, with specificity, detail the rationale behind the decision.
    (c-5) The provisions of this subsection apply only in school districts having a population of 500,000 or more. If the board of education of a school district with a population of 500,000 or more determines that a pupil who is attending school in the district on a tuition free basis is a nonresident of the district for whom tuition is required to be charged under Section 10-20.12a, the board shall notify the person who enrolled the pupil of the amount of the tuition charged under Section 10-20.12a that is due to the district for the nonresident pupil's attendance in the district's schools. The notice shall be given by certified mail, return receipt requested. Within 10 calendar days after receipt of the notice, the person who enrolled the pupil may request a hearing to review the determination of the school board. The request shall be sent by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the district superintendent. Within 30 calendar days after receipt of the request, the board shall notify, by certified mail, return receipt requested, the person requesting the hearing of the time and place of the hearing, which shall be held not less than 10 calendar nor more than 30 calendar days after the notice of hearing is given. The board or a hearing officer designated by the board shall conduct the hearing. The board and the person who enrolled the pupil may each be represented at the hearing by a representative of their choice. At the hearing, the person who enrolled the pupil shall have the burden of going forward with the evidence concerning the pupil's residency. If the hearing is conducted by a hearing officer, the hearing officer, within 20 calendar days after the conclusion of the hearing, shall serve a written report of his or her findings by personal service or by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the school board and to the person who enrolled the pupil. The person who enrolled the pupil may, within 10 calendar days after receiving the findings, file written objections to the findings with the board of education by sending the objections by certified mail, return receipt requested, addressed to the general superintendent of schools. If the hearing is conducted by the board of education, the board shall, within 45 calendar days after the conclusion of the hearing, decide whether or not the pupil is a resident of the district and the amount of any tuition required to be charged under Section 10-20.12a as a result of the pupil's attendance in the schools of the district. If the hearing is conducted by a hearing officer, the board of education shall, within 45 days after the receipt of the hearing officer's findings, decide whether or not the pupil is a resident of the district and the amount of any tuition required to be charged under Section 10-20.12a as a result of the pupil's attendance in the schools of the district. The board of education shall send, by certified mail, return receipt requested, a copy of its decision to the person who enrolled the pupil, and the decision of the board shall be final.
    (d) If a hearing is requested under subsection (c) of this Section to review the determination of the school board or board of education that a nonresident pupil is attending the schools of the district without payment of the tuition required to be charged under Section 10-20.12a, the pupil may, at the request of the person who enrolled the pupil, continue attendance at the schools of the district pending the decision of the board or regional superintendent of schools, as applicable, and the school district's payments under Section 18-8.05 of this Code shall not be adjusted due to tuition collection under this Section. However, attendance of that pupil in the schools of the district as authorized by this subsection (d) shall not relieve any person who enrolled the pupil of the obligation to pay the tuition charged for that attendance under Section 10-20.12a if the final decision of the board or regional superintendent of schools is that the pupil is a nonresident of the district. If a pupil is determined to be a nonresident of the district for whom tuition is required to be charged pursuant to this Section, the board shall refuse to permit the pupil to continue attending the schools of the district unless the required tuition is paid for the pupil.
    (d-5) If a hearing is requested under subsection (c-5) of this Section to review the determination of the board of education that a nonresident pupil is attending the schools of the district without payment of the tuition required to be charged under Section 10-20.12a of this Code, the pupil may, at the request of the person who enrolled the pupil, continue attendance at the schools of the district pending a final decision of the board following the hearing. However, attendance of that pupil in the schools of the district as authorized by this subsection (d-5) shall not relieve any person who enrolled the pupil of the obligation to pay the tuition charged for that attendance under Section 10-20.12a of this Code if the final decision of the board is that the pupil is a nonresident of the district. If a pupil is determined to be a nonresident of the district for whom tuition is required to be charged pursuant to this Section, the board shall refuse to permit the pupil to continue attending the schools of the district unless the required tuition is paid for the pupil.
    (e) Except for a pupil referred to in subsection (b) of Section 10-22.5a, a pupil referred to in Section 10-20.12a, or a pupil referred to in subsection (b) of this Section, a person who knowingly enrolls or attempts to enroll in the schools of a school district on a tuition free basis a pupil known by that person to be a nonresident of the district shall be guilty of a Class C misdemeanor.
    (f) A person who knowingly or wilfully presents to any school district any false information regarding the residency of a pupil for the purpose of enabling that pupil to attend any school in that district without the payment of a nonresident tuition charge shall be guilty of a Class C misdemeanor.
    (g) The provisions of this Section are subject to the provisions of the Education for Homeless Children Act. Nothing in this Section shall be construed to apply to or require the payment of tuition by a parent or guardian of a "homeless child" (as that term is defined in Section 1-5 of the Education for Homeless Children Act) in connection with or as a result of the homeless child's continued education or enrollment in a school that is chosen in accordance with any of the options provided in Section 1-10 of that Act.

    (a) To purchase, at the expense of the district, a sufficient number of textbooks for children whose parents are unable to buy them, including but not limited to children living in households that meet the free lunch or breakfast eligibility guidelines established by the federal government pursuant to Section 1758 of the federal Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act (42 U.S.C. 1758; 7 C.F.R. 245 et seq.), subject to verification as set forth in subsection (c) of this Section. Such textbooks shall be loaned only, and the directors shall require the teacher to see that they are properly cared for and returned at the end of each term of school.
    (b) To waive all fees assessed by the district on children whose parents are unable to afford them, including but not limited to children living in households that meet the free lunch or breakfast eligibility guidelines established by the federal government pursuant to Section 1758 of the federal Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act (42 U.S.C. 1758; 7 C.F.R. 245 et seq.), subject to verification as set forth in subsection (c) of this Section. The school board shall adopt written policies and procedures for such waiver of fees in accordance with regulations promulgated by the State Board of Education.
    (c) Any school board that participates in a federally funded, school-based child nutrition program and uses a student's application for, eligibility for, or participation in the federally funded, school-based child nutrition program (42 U.S.C. 1758; 7 C.F.R. 245 et seq.) as the basis for waiving fees assessed by the school district must follow the verification requirements of the federally funded, school-based child nutrition program (42 U.S.C. 1758; 7 C.F.R. 245.6a).
    A school board that establishes a process for the determination of eligibility for waiver of fees assessed by the school district that is completely independent of a student's application for, eligibility for, or participation in a federally funded, school-based child nutrition program may provide for fee waiver verification no more often than every 60 calendar days. Information obtained during the independent, fee waiver verification process indicating that the student does not meet free lunch or breakfast eligibility guidelines may be used to deny the waiver of the student's fees, provided that any information obtained through this independent process for determining or verifying eligibility for fee waivers shall not be used to determine or verify eligibility for any federally funded, school-based child nutrition program.

However, at no time shall a cause of action lie against a school board for awarding a pupil transportation contract per the standards set forth in this subsection (a) unless the cause of action is based on fraudulent conduct.
    All competitive bids for contracts involving an expenditure in excess of $25,000 or a lower amount as required by board policy must be sealed by the bidder and must be opened by a member or employee of the school board at a public bid opening at which the contents of the bids must be announced. Each bidder must receive at least 3 days' notice of the time and place of the bid opening. For purposes of this Section due advertisement includes, but is not limited to, at least one public notice at least 10 days before the bid date in a newspaper published in the district, or if no newspaper is published in the district, in a newspaper of general circulation in the area of the district. State master contracts and certified education purchasing contracts, as defined in Article 28A of this Code, are not subject to the requirements of this paragraph.
    Under this Section, the acceptance of bids sealed by a bidder and the opening of these bids at a public bid opening may be permitted by an electronic process for communicating, accepting, and opening competitive bids. An electronic bidding process must provide for, but is not limited to, the following safeguards:
        (1) On the date and time certain of a bid opening,
    	
the primary person conducting the competitive, sealed, electronic bid process shall log onto a specified database using a unique username and password previously assigned to the bidder to allow access to the bidder's specific bid project number.
        (2) The specified electronic database must be on a
    	
network that (i) is in a secure environment behind a firewall; (ii) has specific encryption tools; (iii) maintains specific intrusion detection systems; (iv) has redundant systems architecture with data storage back-up, whether by compact disc or tape; and (v) maintains a disaster recovery plan.
It is the legislative intent of Public Act 96-841 to maintain the integrity of the sealed bidding process provided for in this Section, to further limit any possibility of bid-rigging, to reduce administrative costs to school districts, and to effect efficiencies in communications with bidders.
    (b) To require, as a condition of any contract for goods and services, that persons bidding for and awarded a contract and all affiliates of the person collect and remit Illinois Use Tax on all sales of tangible personal property into the State of Illinois in accordance with the provisions of the Illinois Use Tax Act regardless of whether the person or affiliate is a "retailer maintaining a place of business within this State" as defined in Section 2 of the Use Tax Act. For purposes of this Section, the term "affiliate" means any entity that (1) directly, indirectly, or constructively controls another entity, (2) is directly, indirectly, or constructively controlled by another entity, or (3) is subject to the control of a common entity. For purposes of this subsection (b), an entity controls another entity if it owns, directly or individually, more than 10% of the voting securities of that entity. As used in this subsection (b), the term "voting security" means a security that (1) confers upon the holder the right to vote for the election of members of the board of directors or similar governing body of the business or (2) is convertible into, or entitles the holder to receive upon its exercise, a security that confers such a right to vote. A general partnership interest is a voting security.
    To require that bids and contracts include a certification by the bidder or contractor that the bidder or contractor is not barred from bidding for or entering into a contract under this Section and that the bidder or contractor acknowledges that the school board may declare the contract void if the certification completed pursuant to this subsection (b) is false.
    (b-5) To require all contracts and agreements that pertain to goods and services and that are intended to generate additional revenue and other remunerations for the school district in excess of $1,000, including without limitation vending machine contracts, sports and other attire, class rings, and photographic services, to be approved by the school board. The school board shall file as an attachment to its annual budget a report, in a form as determined by the State Board of Education, indicating for the prior year the name of the vendor, the product or service provided, and the actual net revenue and non-monetary remuneration from each of the contracts or agreements. In addition, the report shall indicate for what purpose the revenue was used and how and to whom the non-monetary remuneration was distributed.
    (b-10) To prohibit any contract to purchase food with a bidder or offeror if the bidder's or offeror's contract terms prohibit the school from donating food to food banks, including, but not limited to, homeless shelters, food pantries, and soup kitchens.
    (c) If the State education purchasing entity creates a master contract as defined in Article 28A of this Code, then the State education purchasing entity shall notify school districts of the existence of the master contract.
    (d) In purchasing supplies, materials, equipment, or services that are not subject to subsection (c) of this Section, before a school district solicits bids or awards a contract, the district may review and consider as a bid under subsection (a) of this Section certified education purchasing contracts that are already available through the State education purchasing entity.

    Sec. 10-20.28. Cellular radio telecommunication devices.
    (a) The General Assembly finds and declares that the educational development of all persons to the limits of their capacities is a fundamental goal of the people of this State and that to achieve such goal it is essential to provide a safe and secure learning environment within the public schools. While recognizing that cellular radio telecommunication devices may be used for inappropriate activities during school hours and on school property and may, on occasion, cause disruption to the classroom environment, the General Assembly also recognizes that the use of cellular radio telecommunication devices can decrease the response time of officials to emergency situations. In addition, cellular radio telecommunication devices allow parents an additional and timely method of contacting their children should an emergency situation arise. Therefore, it is the purpose and intention of the General Assembly in enacting this legislation to (i) reduce the occurrence of inappropriate and disruptive activities during school hours and on school property occurring through the use of cellular radio telecommunication devices and (ii) increase the safety of students and school personnel during school hours and on school property.
    (b) The school board may establish appropriate rules and disciplinary procedures governing the use or possession of cellular radio telecommunication devices by a student while in a school or on school property, during regular school hours, or at any other time.

Whenever physical restraints are used, school personnel shall fully document the incident, including the events leading up to the incident, the type of restraint used, the length of time the student is restrained, and the staff involved. The parents or guardian of a student shall be informed whenever physical restraints are used.

The e-learning program shall address the school district's responsibility to ensure that all teachers and staff who may be involved in the provision of e-learning have access to any and all hardware and software that may be required for the program. If a proposed program does not address this responsibility, the school district must propose an alternate program.
    (c) Before its adoption by a school board, the school board must hold a public hearing on a school district's initial proposal for an e-learning program or for renewal of such a program, at a regular or special meeting of the school board, in which the terms of the proposal must be substantially presented and an opportunity for allowing public comments must be provided.

students with special needs;
        (4) to monitor and verify each student's electronic
    	
participation;
        (5) to address the extent to which student
    	
participation is within the student's control as to the time, pace, and means of learning;

        (9) to review and revise the program as implemented
    	
to address difficulties confronted; and
        (10) to ensure that the protocol regarding general
    	
expectations and responsibilities of the program is communicated to teachers, staff, and students at least 30 days prior to utilizing an e-learning day.

    (a) Licensed and nonlicensed applicants for employment with a school district, except school bus driver applicants, are required as a condition of employment to authorize a fingerprint-based criminal history records check to determine if such applicants have been convicted of any disqualifying, enumerated criminal or drug offenses in subsection (c) of this Section or have been convicted, within 7 years of the application for employment with the school district, of any other felony under the laws of this State or of any offense committed or attempted in any other state or against the laws of the United States that, if committed or attempted in this State, would have been punishable as a felony under the laws of this State. Authorization for the check shall be furnished by the applicant to the school district, except that if the applicant is a substitute teacher seeking employment in more than one school district, a teacher seeking concurrent part-time employment positions with more than one school district (as a reading specialist, special education teacher or otherwise), or an educational support personnel employee seeking employment positions with more than one district, any such district may require the applicant to furnish authorization for the check to the regional superintendent of the educational service region in which are located the school districts in which the applicant is seeking employment as a substitute or concurrent part-time teacher or concurrent educational support personnel employee. Upon receipt of this authorization, the school district or the appropriate regional superintendent, as the case may be, shall submit the applicant's name, sex, race, date of birth, social security number, fingerprint images, and other identifiers, as prescribed by the Department of State Police, to the Department. The regional superintendent submitting the requisite information to the Department of State Police shall promptly notify the school districts in which the applicant is seeking employment as a substitute or concurrent part-time teacher or concurrent educational support personnel employee that the check of the applicant has been requested. The Department of State Police and the Federal Bureau of Investigation shall furnish, pursuant to a fingerprint-based criminal history records check, records of convictions, forever and hereinafter, until expunged, to the president of the school board for the school district that requested the check, or to the regional superintendent who requested the check. The Department shall charge the school district or the appropriate regional superintendent a fee for conducting such check, which fee shall be deposited in the State Police Services Fund and shall not exceed the cost of the inquiry; and the applicant shall not be charged a fee for such check by the school district or by the regional superintendent, except that those applicants seeking employment as a substitute teacher with a school district may be charged a fee not to exceed the cost of the inquiry. Subject to appropriations for these purposes, the State Superintendent of Education shall reimburse school districts and regional superintendents for fees paid to obtain criminal history records checks under this Section.
    (a-5) The school district or regional superintendent shall further perform a check of the Statewide Sex Offender Database, as authorized by the Sex Offender Community Notification Law, for each applicant. The check of the Statewide Sex Offender Database must be conducted by the school district or regional superintendent once for every 5 years that an applicant remains employed by the school district.
    (a-6) The school district or regional superintendent shall further perform a check of the Statewide Murderer and Violent Offender Against Youth Database, as authorized by the Murderer and Violent Offender Against Youth Community Notification Law, for each applicant. The check of the Murderer and Violent Offender Against Youth Database must be conducted by the school district or regional superintendent once for every 5 years that an applicant remains employed by the school district.
    (b) Any information concerning the record of convictions obtained by the president of the school board or the regional superintendent shall be confidential and may only be transmitted to the superintendent of the school district or his designee, the appropriate regional superintendent if the check was requested by the school district, the presidents of the appropriate school boards if the check was requested from the Department of State Police by the regional superintendent, the State Board of Education and a school district as authorized under subsection (b-5), the State Superintendent of Education, the State Educator Preparation and Licensure Board, any other person necessary to the decision of hiring the applicant for employment, or for clarification purposes the Department of State Police or Statewide Sex Offender Database, or both. A copy of the record of convictions obtained from the Department of State Police shall be provided to the applicant for employment. Upon the check of the Statewide Sex Offender Database or Statewide Murderer and Violent Offender Against Youth Database, the school district or regional superintendent shall notify an applicant as to whether or not the applicant has been identified in the Database. If a check of an applicant for employment as a substitute or concurrent part-time teacher or concurrent educational support personnel employee in more than one school district was requested by the regional superintendent, and the Department of State Police upon a check ascertains that the applicant has not been convicted of any of the enumerated criminal or drug offenses in subsection (c) of this Section or has not been convicted, within 7 years of the application for employment with the school district, of any other felony under the laws of this State or of any offense committed or attempted in any other state or against the laws of the United States that, if committed or attempted in this State, would have been punishable as a felony under the laws of this State and so notifies the regional superintendent and if the regional superintendent upon a check ascertains that the applicant has not been identified in the Sex Offender Database or Statewide Murderer and Violent Offender Against Youth Database, then the regional superintendent shall issue to the applicant a certificate evidencing that as of the date specified by the Department of State Police the applicant has not been convicted of any of the enumerated criminal or drug offenses in subsection (c) of this Section or has not been convicted, within 7 years of the application for employment with the school district, of any other felony under the laws of this State or of any offense committed or attempted in any other state or against the laws of the United States that, if committed or attempted in this State, would have been punishable as a felony under the laws of this State and evidencing that as of the date that the regional superintendent conducted a check of the Statewide Sex Offender Database or Statewide Murderer and Violent Offender Against Youth Database, the applicant has not been identified in the Database. The school board of any school district may rely on the certificate issued by any regional superintendent to that substitute teacher, concurrent part-time teacher, or concurrent educational support personnel employee or may initiate its own criminal history records check of the applicant through the Department of State Police and its own check of the Statewide Sex Offender Database or Statewide Murderer and Violent Offender Against Youth Database as provided in this Section. Any unauthorized release of confidential information may be a violation of Section 7 of the Criminal Identification Act.
    (b-5) If a criminal history records check or check of the Statewide Sex Offender Database or Statewide Murderer and Violent Offender Against Youth Database is performed by a regional superintendent for an applicant seeking employment as a substitute teacher with a school district, the regional superintendent may disclose to the State Board of Education whether the applicant has been issued a certificate under subsection (b) based on those checks. If the State Board receives information on an applicant under this subsection, then it must indicate in the Educator Licensure Information System for a 90-day period that the applicant has been issued or has not been issued a certificate.
    (c) No school board shall knowingly employ a person who has been convicted of any offense that would subject him or her to license suspension or revocation pursuant to Section 21B-80 of this Code, except as provided under subsection (b) of Section 21B-80. Further, no school board shall knowingly employ a person who has been found to be the perpetrator of sexual or physical abuse of any minor under 18 years of age pursuant to proceedings under Article II of the Juvenile Court Act of 1987. As a condition of employment, each school board must consider the status of a person who has been issued an indicated finding of abuse or neglect of a child by the Department of Children and Family Services under the Abused and Neglected Child Reporting Act or by a child welfare agency of another jurisdiction.
    (d) No school board shall knowingly employ a person for whom a criminal history records check and a Statewide Sex Offender Database check have not been initiated.
    (e) Within 10 days after a superintendent, regional office of education, or entity that provides background checks of license holders to public schools receives information of a pending criminal charge against a license holder for an offense set forth in Section 21B-80 of this Code, the superintendent, regional office of education, or entity must notify the State Superintendent of Education of the pending criminal charge.
    If permissible by federal or State law, no later than 15 business days after receipt of a record of conviction or of checking the Statewide Murderer and Violent Offender Against Youth Database or the Statewide Sex Offender Database and finding a registration, the superintendent of the employing school board or the applicable regional superintendent shall, in writing, notify the State Superintendent of Education of any license holder who has been convicted of a crime set forth in Section 21B-80 of this Code. Upon receipt of the record of a conviction of or a finding of child abuse by a holder of any license issued pursuant to Article 21B or Section 34-8.1 or 34-83 of the School Code, the State Superintendent of Education may initiate licensure suspension and revocation proceedings as authorized by law. If the receipt of the record of conviction or finding of child abuse is received within 6 months after the initial grant of or renewal of a license, the State Superintendent of Education may rescind the license holder's license.
    (e-5) The superintendent of the employing school board shall, in writing, notify the State Superintendent of Education and the applicable regional superintendent of schools of any license holder whom he or she has reasonable cause to believe has committed an intentional act of abuse or neglect with the result of making a child an abused child or a neglected child, as defined in Section 3 of the Abused and Neglected Child Reporting Act, and that act resulted in the license holder's dismissal or resignation from the school district. This notification must be submitted within 30 days after the dismissal or resignation. The license holder must also be contemporaneously sent a copy of the notice by the superintendent. All correspondence, documentation, and other information so received by the regional superintendent of schools, the State Superintendent of Education, the State Board of Education, or the State Educator Preparation and Licensure Board under this subsection (e-5) is confidential and must not be disclosed to third parties, except (i) as necessary for the State Superintendent of Education or his or her designee to investigate and prosecute pursuant to Article 21B of this Code, (ii) pursuant to a court order, (iii) for disclosure to the license holder or his or her representative, or (iv) as otherwise provided in this Article and provided that any such information admitted into evidence in a hearing is exempt from this confidentiality and non-disclosure requirement. Except for an act of willful or wanton misconduct, any superintendent who provides notification as required in this subsection (e-5) shall have immunity from any liability, whether civil or criminal or that otherwise might result by reason of such action.
    (f) After January 1, 1990 the provisions of this Section shall apply to all employees of persons or firms holding contracts with any school district including, but not limited to, food service workers, school bus drivers and other transportation employees, who have direct, daily contact with the pupils of any school in such district. For purposes of criminal history records checks and checks of the Statewide Sex Offender Database on employees of persons or firms holding contracts with more than one school district and assigned to more than one school district, the regional superintendent of the educational service region in which the contracting school districts are located may, at the request of any such school district, be responsible for receiving the authorization for a criminal history records check prepared by each such employee and submitting the same to the Department of State Police and for conducting a check of the Statewide Sex Offender Database for each employee. Any information concerning the record of conviction and identification as a sex offender of any such employee obtained by the regional superintendent shall be promptly reported to the president of the appropriate school board or school boards.
    (f-5) Upon request of a school or school district, any information obtained by a school district pursuant to subsection (f) of this Section within the last year must be made available to the requesting school or school district.
    (g) Prior to the commencement of any student teaching experience or required internship (which is referred to as student teaching in this Section) in the public schools, a student teacher is required to authorize a fingerprint-based criminal history records check. Authorization for and payment of the costs of the check must be furnished by the student teacher to the school district where the student teaching is to be completed. Upon receipt of this authorization and payment, the school district shall submit the student teacher's name, sex, race, date of birth, social security number, fingerprint images, and other identifiers, as prescribed by the Department of State Police, to the Department of State Police. The Department of State Police and the Federal Bureau of Investigation shall furnish, pursuant to a fingerprint-based criminal history records check, records of convictions, forever and hereinafter, until expunged, to the president of the school board for the school district that requested the check. The Department shall charge the school district a fee for conducting the check, which fee must not exceed the cost of the inquiry and must be deposited into the State Police Services Fund. The school district shall further perform a check of the Statewide Sex Offender Database, as authorized by the Sex Offender Community Notification Law, and of the Statewide Murderer and Violent Offender Against Youth Database, as authorized by the Murderer and Violent Offender Against Youth Registration Act, for each student teacher. No school board may knowingly allow a person to student teach for whom a criminal history records check, a Statewide Sex Offender Database check, and a Statewide Murderer and Violent Offender Against Youth Database check have not been completed and reviewed by the district.
    A copy of the record of convictions obtained from the Department of State Police must be provided to the student teacher. Any information concerning the record of convictions obtained by the president of the school board is confidential and may only be transmitted to the superintendent of the school district or his or her designee, the State Superintendent of Education, the State Educator Preparation and Licensure Board, or, for clarification purposes, the Department of State Police or the Statewide Sex Offender Database or Statewide Murderer and Violent Offender Against Youth Database. Any unauthorized release of confidential information may be a violation of Section 7 of the Criminal Identification Act.
    No school board shall knowingly allow a person to student teach who has been convicted of any offense that would subject him or her to license suspension or revocation pursuant to subsection (c) of Section 21B-80 of this Code, except as provided under subsection (b) of Section 21B-80. Further, no school board shall allow a person to student teach if he or she has been found to be the perpetrator of sexual or physical abuse of a minor under 18 years of age pursuant to proceedings under Article II of the Juvenile Court Act of 1987. Each school board must consider the status of a person to student teach who has been issued an indicated finding of abuse or neglect of a child by the Department of Children and Family Services under the Abused and Neglected Child Reporting Act or by a child welfare agency of another jurisdiction.

    (105 ILCS 5/10-21.10) (from Ch. 122, par. 10-21.10)
    Sec. 10-21.10. Electronic paging devices on school property. (a) The General Assembly finds and declares that the educational development of all persons to the limits of their capacities is a fundamental goal of the people of this State, that to achieve such goal it is essential to provide a safe and secure learning environment within the public schools, and that the unrestricted and unregulated use by students of pocket pagers and similar electronic paging devices on school grounds or in school buildings which are owned, occupied or leased by a school board for school purposes and activities adversely affects the educational environment, welfare and safety of students enrolled in the public schools, in that pocket pagers and similar electronic paging devices are being regularly used for the conduct of unlawful activities during school hours and on school property, including activities directly related to the unlawful possession, sale, delivery or other trafficking in drugs or other substances which constitute a "controlled substance" as that term is defined in the Illinois Controlled Substances Act. It is the purpose and intention of the General Assembly, in enacting this legislation, to reduce or eliminate the occurrence of such unlawful activities during school hours and on school property by restricting and regulating student use or possession of pocket pagers and similar electronic paging devices as provided in this Section, and by providing for the imposition of appropriate discipline and sanctions for any violation of the provisions of this Section.
    (b) No student shall use or have in his or her possession any pocket pager or similar electronic paging device while in any school building or on any school property, during regular school hours or at any other time, unless the use or possession of such device by such student has first been expressly authorized by the school board acting in accordance with standards developed as provided in subsection (c) for the granting of approved exceptions to the general prohibition of this Section against such use or possession.
    (c) The school board shall develop and promulgate written standards under which the board:
    (1) may authorize the use or possession of a pocket pager or similar electronic paging device by a student while in a school building or on school property as an approved exception to the general prohibition of this Section against such use or possession; and
    (2) may impose appropriate discipline or other sanctions against any student who violates any provision of this Section.

    Sec. 10-22.6. Suspension or expulsion of pupils; school searches.
    (a) To expel pupils guilty of gross disobedience or misconduct, including gross disobedience or misconduct perpetuated by electronic means, pursuant to subsection (b-20) of this Section, and no action shall lie against them for such expulsion. Expulsion shall take place only after the parents have been requested to appear at a meeting of the board, or with a hearing officer appointed by it, to discuss their child's behavior. Such request shall be made by registered or certified mail and shall state the time, place and purpose of the meeting. The board, or a hearing officer appointed by it, at such meeting shall state the reasons for dismissal and the date on which the expulsion is to become effective. If a hearing officer is appointed by the board, he shall report to the board a written summary of the evidence heard at the meeting and the board may take such action thereon as it finds appropriate. If the board acts to expel a pupil, the written expulsion decision shall detail the specific reasons why removing the pupil from the learning environment is in the best interest of the school. The expulsion decision shall also include a rationale as to the specific duration of the expulsion. An expelled pupil may be immediately transferred to an alternative program in the manner provided in Article 13A or 13B of this Code. A pupil must not be denied transfer because of the expulsion, except in cases in which such transfer is deemed to cause a threat to the safety of students or staff in the alternative program.
    (b) To suspend or by policy to authorize the superintendent of the district or the principal, assistant principal, or dean of students of any school to suspend pupils guilty of gross disobedience or misconduct, or to suspend pupils guilty of gross disobedience or misconduct on the school bus from riding the school bus, pursuant to subsections (b-15) and (b-20) of this Section, and no action shall lie against them for such suspension. The board may by policy authorize the superintendent of the district or the principal, assistant principal, or dean of students of any school to suspend pupils guilty of such acts for a period not to exceed 10 school days. If a pupil is suspended due to gross disobedience or misconduct on a school bus, the board may suspend the pupil in excess of 10 school days for safety reasons.
    Any suspension shall be reported immediately to the parents or guardian of a pupil along with a full statement of the reasons for such suspension and a notice of their right to a review. The school board must be given a summary of the notice, including the reason for the suspension and the suspension length. Upon request of the parents or guardian, the school board or a hearing officer appointed by it shall review such action of the superintendent or principal, assistant principal, or dean of students. At such review, the parents or guardian of the pupil may appear and discuss the suspension with the board or its hearing officer. If a hearing officer is appointed by the board, he shall report to the board a written summary of the evidence heard at the meeting. After its hearing or upon receipt of the written report of its hearing officer, the board may take such action as it finds appropriate. If a student is suspended pursuant to this subsection (b), the board shall, in the written suspension decision, detail the specific act of gross disobedience or misconduct resulting in the decision to suspend. The suspension decision shall also include a rationale as to the specific duration of the suspension. A pupil who is suspended in excess of 20 school days may be immediately transferred to an alternative program in the manner provided in Article 13A or 13B of this Code. A pupil must not be denied transfer because of the suspension, except in cases in which such transfer is deemed to cause a threat to the safety of students or staff in the alternative program.
    (b-5) Among the many possible disciplinary interventions and consequences available to school officials, school exclusions, such as out-of-school suspensions and expulsions, are the most serious. School officials shall limit the number and duration of expulsions and suspensions to the greatest extent practicable, and it is recommended that they use them only for legitimate educational purposes. To ensure that students are not excluded from school unnecessarily, it is recommended that school officials consider forms of non-exclusionary discipline prior to using out-of-school suspensions or expulsions.
    (b-10) Unless otherwise required by federal law or this Code, school boards may not institute zero-tolerance policies by which school administrators are required to suspend or expel students for particular behaviors.
    (b-15) Out-of-school suspensions of 3 days or less may be used only if the student's continuing presence in school would pose a threat to school safety or a disruption to other students' learning opportunities. For purposes of this subsection (b-15), "threat to school safety or a disruption to other students' learning opportunities" shall be determined on a case-by-case basis by the school board or its designee. School officials shall make all reasonable efforts to resolve such threats, address such disruptions, and minimize the length of suspensions to the greatest extent practicable.
    (b-20) Unless otherwise required by this Code, out-of-school suspensions of longer than 3 days, expulsions, and disciplinary removals to alternative schools may be used only if other appropriate and available behavioral and disciplinary interventions have been exhausted and the student's continuing presence in school would either (i) pose a threat to the safety of other students, staff, or members of the school community or (ii) substantially disrupt, impede, or interfere with the operation of the school. For purposes of this subsection (b-20), "threat to the safety of other students, staff, or members of the school community" and "substantially disrupt, impede, or interfere with the operation of the school" shall be determined on a case-by-case basis by school officials. For purposes of this subsection (b-20), the determination of whether "appropriate and available behavioral and disciplinary interventions have been exhausted" shall be made by school officials. School officials shall make all reasonable efforts to resolve such threats, address such disruptions, and minimize the length of student exclusions to the greatest extent practicable. Within the suspension decision described in subsection (b) of this Section or the expulsion decision described in subsection (a) of this Section, it shall be documented whether other interventions were attempted or whether it was determined that there were no other appropriate and available interventions.
    (b-25) Students who are suspended out-of-school for longer than 4 school days shall be provided appropriate and available support services during the period of their suspension. For purposes of this subsection (b-25), "appropriate and available support services" shall be determined by school authorities. Within the suspension decision described in subsection (b) of this Section, it shall be documented whether such services are to be provided or whether it was determined that there are no such appropriate and available services.
    A school district may refer students who are expelled to appropriate and available support services.
    A school district shall create a policy to facilitate the re-engagement of students who are suspended out-of-school, expelled, or returning from an alternative school setting.
    (b-30) A school district shall create a policy by which suspended pupils, including those pupils suspended from the school bus who do not have alternate transportation to school, shall have the opportunity to make up work for equivalent academic credit. It shall be the responsibility of a pupil's parent or guardian to notify school officials that a pupil suspended from the school bus does not have alternate transportation to school.
    (c) The Department of Human Services shall be invited to send a representative to consult with the board at such meeting whenever there is evidence that mental illness may be the cause for expulsion or suspension.
    (c-5) School districts shall make reasonable efforts to provide ongoing professional development to teachers, administrators, school board members, school resource officers, and staff on the adverse consequences of school exclusion and justice-system involvement, effective classroom management strategies, culturally responsive discipline, the appropriate and available supportive services for the promotion of student attendance and engagement, and developmentally appropriate disciplinary methods that promote positive and healthy school climates.
    (d) The board may expel a student for a definite period of time not to exceed 2 calendar years, as determined on a case-by-case basis. A student who is determined to have brought one of the following objects to school, any school-sponsored activity or event, or any activity or event that bears a reasonable relationship to school shall be expelled for a period of not less than one year:
        (1) A firearm. For the purposes of this Section,
    	
"firearm" means any gun, rifle, shotgun, weapon as defined by Section 921 of Title 18 of the United States Code, firearm as defined in Section 1.1 of the Firearm Owners Identification Card Act, or firearm as defined in Section 24-1 of the Criminal Code of 2012. The expulsion period under this subdivision (1) may be modified by the superintendent, and the superintendent's determination may be modified by the board on a case-by-case basis.
        (2) A knife, brass knuckles or other knuckle weapon
    	
regardless of its composition, a billy club, or any other object if used or attempted to be used to cause bodily harm, including "look alikes" of any firearm as defined in subdivision (1) of this subsection (d). The expulsion requirement under this subdivision (2) may be modified by the superintendent, and the superintendent's determination may be modified by the board on a case-by-case basis.
Expulsion or suspension shall be construed in a manner consistent with the federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. A student who is subject to suspension or expulsion as provided in this Section may be eligible for a transfer to an alternative school program in accordance with Article 13A of the School Code.
    (d-5) The board may suspend or by regulation authorize the superintendent of the district or the principal, assistant principal, or dean of students of any school to suspend a student for a period not to exceed 10 school days or may expel a student for a definite period of time not to exceed 2 calendar years, as determined on a case-by-case basis, if (i) that student has been determined to have made an explicit threat on an Internet website against a school employee, a student, or any school-related personnel, (ii) the Internet website through which the threat was made is a site that was accessible within the school at the time the threat was made or was available to third parties who worked or studied within the school grounds at the time the threat was made, and (iii) the threat could be reasonably interpreted as threatening to the safety and security of the threatened individual because of his or her duties or employment status or status as a student inside the school.
    (e) To maintain order and security in the schools, school authorities may inspect and search places and areas such as lockers, desks, parking lots, and other school property and equipment owned or controlled by the school, as well as personal effects left in those places and areas by students, without notice to or the consent of the student, and without a search warrant. As a matter of public policy, the General Assembly finds that students have no reasonable expectation of privacy in these places and areas or in their personal effects left in these places and areas. School authorities may request the assistance of law enforcement officials for the purpose of conducting inspections and searches of lockers, desks, parking lots, and other school property and equipment owned or controlled by the school for illegal drugs, weapons, or other illegal or dangerous substances or materials, including searches conducted through the use of specially trained dogs. If a search conducted in accordance with this Section produces evidence that the student has violated or is violating either the law, local ordinance, or the school's policies or rules, such evidence may be seized by school authorities, and disciplinary action may be taken. School authorities may also turn over such evidence to law enforcement authorities.
    (f) Suspension or expulsion may include suspension or expulsion from school and all school activities and a prohibition from being present on school grounds.
    (g) A school district may adopt a policy providing that if a student is suspended or expelled for any reason from any public or private school in this or any other state, the student must complete the entire term of the suspension or expulsion in an alternative school program under Article 13A of this Code or an alternative learning opportunities program under Article 13B of this Code before being admitted into the school district if there is no threat to the safety of students or staff in the alternative program.
    (h) School officials shall not advise or encourage students to drop out voluntarily due to behavioral or academic difficulties.
    (i) A student may not be issued a monetary fine or fee as a disciplinary consequence, though this shall not preclude requiring a student to provide restitution for lost, stolen, or damaged property.
    (j) Subsections (a) through (i) of this Section shall apply to elementary and secondary schools, charter schools, special charter districts, and school districts organized under Article 34 of this Code.
    (k) The expulsion of children enrolled in programs funded under Section 1C-2 of this Code is subject to the requirements under paragraph (7) of subsection (a) of Section 2-3.71 of this Code.
    (l) Beginning with the 2018-2019 school year, an in-school suspension program provided by a school district for any students in kindergarten through grade 12 may focus on promoting non-violent conflict resolution and positive interaction with other students and school personnel. A school district may employ a school social worker or a licensed mental health professional to oversee an in-school suspension program in kindergarten through grade 12.

supporting professional workers, necessary non-certified workers, clerks, custodial employees, and any district taxes specifically for their pension and retirement benefits.
        b. Equipment and supplies necessary for program
    	
operation.
        c. Administrative costs.
        d. Operation of physical plant, including heat,
    	
light, water, repairs, and maintenance.
        e. Auxiliary service, not including any
    	
transportation cost.
    From such total cost thus determined there shall be deducted the State reimbursement due on account of such educational facility for the same year, not including any State reimbursement for area secondary vocational school transportation. Such net cost shall be divided by the average number of pupils in average daily attendance in such area secondary vocational school facility for the school year in order to arrive at the net per capita tuition cost. Such costs shall be computed on pupils regularly enrolled in an area secondary vocational school on the basis of one-sixth day for every class hour attended pursuant to such enrollment. Provided, that the board subject to the approval of the county superintendent of schools may determine what schools outside of their district such pupils shall attend. This section does not require the board of directors or board of education of any district to admit pupils from another district.

If the majority of those voting upon the proposition in the district contemplating deactivation vote in favor of the proposition, the board of that district, upon approval of the board of the receiving district, shall execute a contract with the receiving district providing for the reassignment of students to the receiving district. If the deactivating district seeks to send its students to more than one district, it shall execute a contract with each receiving district. The length of the contract shall be for 2 school years, but the districts may renew the contract for additional one year or 2 year periods. Contract renewals shall be executed by January 1 of the year in which the existing contract expires. If the majority of those voting upon the proposition do not vote in favor of the proposition, the school facility may not be deactivated.
    The sending district shall pay to the receiving district an amount agreed upon by the 2 districts.
    When the deactivation of school facilities becomes effective pursuant to this Section, the provisions of subsection (h) of Section 24-11 of this Code relative to the contractual continued service status of teachers having contractual continued service whose positions are transferred from one board to the control of a different board shall apply, and the positions at the school facilities being deactivated held by teachers, as that term is defined in subsection (a) of Section 24-11 of this Code, having contractual continued service with the school district at the time of the deactivation shall be transferred to the control of the board or boards who shall be receiving the district's students on the following basis:

        (2) positions of such teachers in contractual
    	
continued service that were full time positions and as to which there is no selection left under subparagraph 1 hereof shall be transferred to the appropriate board.
    The contractual continued service status of any teacher thereby transferred to another district is not lost and the receiving board is subject to the School Code with respect to such transferred teacher in the same manner as if such teacher was the district's employee during the time such teacher was actually employed by the board of the deactivating district from which the position was transferred.
    When the deactivation of school facilities becomes effective pursuant to this Section, the provisions of subsection (b) of Section 10-23.5 of this Code relative to the transfer of educational support personnel employees shall apply, and the positions at the school facilities being deactivated that are held by educational support personnel employees at the time of the deactivation shall be transferred to the control of the board or boards that will be receiving the district's students on the following basis:
        (A) positions of such educational support personnel
    	
employees that were full-time positions shall be transferred to the control of whichever of the boards the employees request, with the educational support personnel employees making these requests proceeding in the order of those with the greatest length of continuing service with the board to those with the shortest length of continuing service with the board, provided that the number selecting one board over another board or other boards must not exceed that proportion of students going to such board or boards; and
        (B) positions of such educational support personnel
    	
employees that were full-time positions and as to which there is no selection left under subdivision (A) shall be transferred to the appropriate board.
The length of continuing service of any educational support personnel employee thereby transferred to another district is not lost and the receiving board is subject to this Code with respect to that transferred educational support personnel employee in the same manner as if the educational support personnel employee was the district's employee during the time the educational support personnel employee was actually employed by the board of the deactivating district from which the position was transferred.
    (b) The provisions of this subsection shall not apply to the reactivation of a high school facility which is deactivated under subsection (c). The sending district may, with the approval of the voters in the district, reactivate the school facility which was deactivated. The board of the district seeking to reactivate the school facility shall, by proper resolution, cause the proposition to reactivate to be submitted to the voters of the district at a regularly scheduled election.

    (c) The school board of any unit school district which experienced a strike by a majority of its certified employees that endured for over 6 months during the regular school term of the 1986-1987 school year, and which during the ensuing 1987-1988 school year had an enrollment in grades 9 through 12 of less than 125 students may, when in its judgment the interests of the district and of the students therein will be best served thereby, deactivate the high school facilities within the district for the regular term of the 1988-1989 school year and, for that school year only, send the students of such high school in grades 9 through 12 to schools in adjoining or adjacent districts. Such action may only be taken: (a) by proper resolution of the school board deactivating its high school facilities and the approval, by proper resolution, of the school board of the receiving district or districts, and (b) pursuant to a contract between the sending and each receiving district, which contract or contracts: (i) shall provide for the reassignment of all students of the deactivated high school in grades 9 through 12 to the receiving district or districts; (ii) shall apply only to the regular school term of the 1988-1989 school year; (iii) shall not be subject to renewal or extension; and (iv) shall require the sending district to pay to the receiving district the cost of educating each student who is reassigned to the receiving district, such costs to be an amount agreed upon by the sending and receiving district but not less than the per capita cost of maintaining the high school in the receiving district during the 1987-1988 school year. Any high school facility deactivated pursuant to this subsection for the regular school term of the 1988-1989 school year shall be reactivated by operation of law as of the end of the regular term of the 1988-1989 school year. The status as a unit school district of a district which deactivates its high school facilities pursuant to this subsection shall not be affected by reason of such deactivation of its high school facilities and such district shall continue to be deemed in law a school district maintaining grades kindergarten through 12 for all purposes relating to the levy, extension, collection and payment of the taxes of the district under Article 17 for the 1988-1989 school year.
    (d) Whenever a school facility is reactivated pursuant to the provisions of this Section, then all teachers in contractual continued service who were honorably dismissed or transferred as part of the deactivation process, in addition to other rights they may have under the School Code, shall be recalled or transferred back to the original district.

Such action shall be taken for a minimum period of 20 school years, and may be taken only with the approval of the voters of each district. A district with 600 or more students enrolled in grades 9 through 12 may qualify for inclusion with one or more districts having less than 600 such students by receiving a size waiver from the State Board of Education based on a finding that such inclusion would significantly increase the educational opportunities of the district's students, and by meeting the other prerequisites of this Section. The board of each district contemplating such joint operation shall, by proper resolution, cause the proposition to enter into such joint operation to be submitted to the voters of the district at a regularly scheduled election.

If the majority of those voting on the proposition in each district vote in favor of the proposition, the school boards of the participating districts may, if they agree on terms, execute a contract for such joint operation subject to the following provisions of this Section.
    (b) The agreement for joint operation of any such cooperative high school shall include, but not be limited to, provisions for administration, staff, programs, financing, facilities, and transportation. Such agreements may be modified, extended, or terminated by approval of each of the participating districts, provided that a district may withdraw from the agreement during its initial 20-year term only if the district is reorganizing with one or more districts under other provisions of this Code. Even if 2 or more of the participating district boards approve an extension of the agreement, any other participating district shall, upon failure of its board to approve such extension, disengage from such participation at the end of the then current agreement term.
    (c) A governing board, which shall govern the operation of any such cooperative high school, shall be composed of an equal number of board members from each of the participating districts, except that where all participating district boards concur, membership on the governing board may be apportioned to reflect the number of students in each respective district who attend the cooperative high school. The membership of the governing board shall be not less than 6 nor more than 10 and shall be set by the agreement entered into by the participating districts. The school board of each participating district shall select, from its membership, its representatives on the governing board. The governing board shall prepare and adopt a budget for the cooperative high school. The governing board shall administer the cooperative high school in accordance with the agreement of the districts and shall have the power to hire, supervise, and terminate staff; to enter into contracts; to adopt policies for the school; and to take all other actions necessary and proper for the operation of the school. However, the governing board may not levy taxes or incur any indebtedness except within the annual budget approved by the participating districts.
    (d) (Blank).
    (e) Each participating district shall pay its per capita cost of educating the students residing in its district and attending any such cooperative high school into the budget for the maintenance and operation of the cooperative high school.
    The manner of determining per capita cost shall be set forth in the agreement. Each district shall pay the amount owed the governing board under the terms of the agreement from the fund that the district would have used if the district had incurred the costs directly and may levy taxes and issue bonds as otherwise authorized for these purposes in order to make payments to the governing board.
    (f) Additional school districts having an enrollment in grades 9 through 12 of less than 600 students may be added to the agreement in accordance with the process described in subsection (a) of this Section. In the event additional districts are added, a new contract shall be executed in accordance with the provisions of this Section.
    (g) Upon formation of the cooperative high school, the school board of each participating district shall:
        (1) confer and coordinate with each other and the
    	
governing board, if the governing board is then in existence, as to staffing needs for the cooperative high school;
        (2) in consultation with any exclusive employee
    	
representatives and the governing board, if the governing board is then in existence, establish a combined list of teachers in all participating districts, categorized by positions, showing the length of service and the contractual continued service status, if any, of each teacher in each participating district who is qualified to hold any such positions at the cooperative high school, and then distribute this list to the exclusive employee representatives on or before February 1 of the school year prior to the commencement of the operation of the cooperative high school or within 30 days after the date of the referendum election if the proposition receives a majority of those voting in each district, whichever occurs first. This list is in addition to and not a substitute for any list mandated by Section 24-12 of this Code; and
        (3) transfer to the governing board of the
    	
cooperative high school the employment and the position of so many of the full-time or part-time high school teachers employed by a participating district as are jointly determined by the school boards of the participating districts and the governing board, if the governing board is then in existence, to be needed at the cooperative high school, provided that these teacher transfers shall be done:
            (A) by categories listed on the seniority list
        	
mentioned in subdivision (2) of this subsection (g);
            (B) in each category, by having teachers in
        	
contractual continued service being transferred before any teachers who are not in contractual continued service; and
            (C) in order from greatest seniority first
        	
through lesser amounts of seniority.
    A teacher who is not in contractual continued service shall not be transferred if there is a teacher in contractual continued service in the same category who is qualified to hold the position that is to be filled.
    If there are more teachers who have entered upon contractual continued service than there are available positions at the cooperative high school or within other assignments in the district, a school board shall first remove or dismiss all teachers who have not entered upon contractual continued service before removing or dismissing any teacher who has entered upon contractual continued service and who is legally qualified (i) to hold a position at the cooperative high school planned to be held by a teacher who has not entered upon contractual continued service or (ii) to hold another position in the participating district. As between teachers who have entered upon contractual continued service, the teacher or teachers with the shorter length of continuing service in any of the participating districts shall be dismissed first. Any teacher dismissed as a result of such a decrease shall be paid all earned compensation on or before the third business day following the last day of pupil attendance in the regular school term. If the school board that has dismissed a teacher or the governing board has any vacancies for the following school term or within one calendar year from the beginning of the following school term, the positions thereby becoming available shall be tendered to the teachers so removed or dismissed so far as they are legally qualified to hold such positions. However, if the number of honorable dismissal notices in all participating districts exceeds 15% of full-time equivalent positions filled by certified employees (excluding principals and administrative personnel) during the preceding school year in all participating districts and if the school board that has dismissed a teacher or the governing board has any vacancies for the following school term or within 2 calendar years from the beginning of the following school term, the positions so becoming available shall be tendered to the teachers who were so notified, removed, or dismissed whenever these teachers are legally qualified to hold such positions.
    The provisions of subsection (h) of Section 24-11 of this Code concerning teachers whose positions are transferred from one board to the control of a different board shall apply to the teachers who are transferred. The contractual continued service of any transferred teacher is not lost and the governing board is subject to this Code with respect to the teacher in the same manner as if the teacher had been the governing board's employee during the time the teacher was actually employed by the board of the district from which the position and the teacher's employment were transferred. The time spent in employment with a participating district by any teacher who has not yet entered upon contractual continued service and who is transferred to the governing board is not lost when computing the time necessary for the teacher to enter upon contractual continued service, and the governing board is subject to this Code with respect to the teacher in the same manner as if the teacher had been the governing board's employee during the time the teacher was actually employed by the school board from which the position and the teacher's employment were transferred.
    If the cooperative high school is dissolved, any teacher who was transferred from a participating district shall be transferred back to the district and subsection (h) of Section 24-11 of this Code shall apply. In that case, a district is subject to this Code in the same manner as if the teacher transferred back had been continuously in the service of the receiving district.
    (h) Upon formation of the cooperative high school, the school board of each participating district shall:
        (1) confer and coordinate with each other and the
    	
governing board, if the governing board is then in existence, as to needs for educational support personnel for the cooperative high school;
        (2) in consultation with any exclusive employee
    	
representative or bargaining agent and the governing board, if the governing board is then in existence, establish a combined list of educational support personnel in participating districts, categorized by positions, showing the length of continuing service of each full-time educational support personnel employee who is qualified to hold any such position at the cooperative high school, and then distribute this list to the exclusive employee representative or bargaining agent on or before February 1 of the school year prior to the commencement of the operation of the cooperative high school or within 30 days after the date of the referendum election if the proposition receives a majority of those voting in each district, whichever occurs first; and
        (3) transfer to the governing board of the
    	
cooperative high school the employment and the positions of so many of the full-time educational support personnel employees employed by a participating district as are jointly determined by the school boards of the participating districts and the governing board, if the governing board is then in existence, to be needed at the cooperative high school, provided that the full-time educational personnel employee transfers shall be done by categories on the seniority list mentioned in subdivision (2) of this subsection (h) and done in order from greatest seniority first through lesser amounts of seniority.
    If there are more full-time educational support personnel employees than there are available positions at the cooperative high school or in the participating district, a school board shall first remove or dismiss those educational support personnel employees with the shorter length of continuing service in any of the participating districts, within the respective category of position. The governing board is subject to this Code with respect to the educational support personnel employee as if the educational support personnel employee had been the governing board's employee during the time the educational support personnel employee was actually employed by the school board of the district from which the employment and position were transferred. Any educational support personnel employee dismissed as a result of such a decrease shall be paid all earned compensation on or before the third business day following his or her last day of employment. If the school board that has dismissed the educational support personnel employee or the governing board has any vacancies for the following school term or within one calendar year from the beginning of the following school term, the positions thereby becoming available within a specific category of position shall be tendered to the employees so removed or dismissed from that category of position so far as they are legally qualified to hold such positions. If the cooperative high school is dissolved, any educational support personnel employee who was transferred from a participating district shall be transferred back to the district and Section 10-23.5 of this Code shall apply. In that case, a district is subject to this Code in the same manner as if the educational support personnel employee transferred back had been continuously in the service of the receiving district.
    (i) Two or more school districts not contiguous to each other, each of which has an enrollment in grades 9 through 12 of less than 600 students, may jointly operate one or more cooperative high schools if the following requirements are met and documented within 2 calendar years prior to the proposition filing date, pursuant to subsection (a) of this Section:
        (1) the distance between each district administrative
    	
office is documented as no more than 30 miles;
        (2) every district contiguous to the district wishing
    	
to operate one or more cooperative high schools under the provisions of this Section determines that it is not interested in participating in such joint operation, through a vote of its school board, and documents that non-interest in a letter to the districts wishing to form the cooperative high school containing approved minutes that record the school board vote;
        (3) documentation of meeting these requirements is
    	
attached to the board resolution required under subsection (a) of this Section; and
        (4) all other provisions of this Section are
    	
followed.

    If there are more teachers who have entered upon contractual continued service than there are available positions at the cooperative elementary school or cooperative high school, or both or within other assignments in the district, a school board shall first remove or dismiss all teachers who have not entered upon contractual continued service before removing or dismissing any teacher who has entered upon contractual continued service and who is legally qualified (i) to hold a position at the cooperative elementary school or cooperative high school, or both planned to be held by a teacher who has not entered upon contractual continued service or (ii) to hold another position in the participating district. As between teachers who have entered upon contractual continued service, the teacher or teachers with the shorter length of continuing service in any of the participating districts shall be dismissed first. Any teacher dismissed as a result of such a decrease shall be paid all earned compensation on or before the third business day following the last day of pupil attendance in the regular school term. If the school board that has dismissed a teacher or the governing board has any vacancies for the following school term or within one calendar year from the beginning of the following school term, then the positions thereby becoming available shall be tendered to the teachers so removed or dismissed so far as they are legally qualified to hold such positions. If the number of honorable dismissal notices in all participating districts exceeds 15% of full-time equivalent positions filled by certified employees (excluding principals and administrative personnel) during the preceding school year in all participating districts and if the school board that has dismissed a teacher or the governing board has any vacancies for the following school term or within 2 calendar years from the beginning of the following school term, the positions so becoming available shall be tendered to the teachers who were so notified, removed, or dismissed whenever these teachers are legally qualified to hold those positions.
    The provisions of subsection (h) of Section 24-11 of this Code concerning teachers whose positions are transferred from one board to the control of a different board shall apply to the teachers who are transferred. The contractual continued service of any transferred teacher is not lost and the governing board is subject to this Code with respect to the teacher in the same manner as if the teacher had been the governing board's employee during the time the teacher was actually employed by the board of the district from which the position and the teacher's employment were transferred. The time spent in employment with a participating district by any teacher who has not yet entered upon contractual continued service and who is transferred to the governing board is not lost when computing the time necessary for the teacher to enter upon contractual continued service, and the governing board is subject to this Code with respect to the teacher in the same manner as if the teacher had been the governing board's employee during the time the teacher was actually employed by the school board from which the position and the teacher's employment were transferred.
    At the conclusion of the pilot program, any teacher who was transferred from a participating district shall be transferred back to the district and subsection (h) of Section 24-11 of this Code shall apply. In that case, a district is subject to this Code in the same manner as if the teacher transferred back had been continuously in the service of the receiving district.
    (f) Upon formation of the cooperative elementary school or cooperative high school, or both, the school board of each participating district shall:
        (1) confer and coordinate with each other and the
    	
governing board, if the governing board is then in existence, as to needs for educational support personnel for the cooperative elementary school or cooperative high school, or both;
        (2) in consultation with any exclusive employee
    	
representative or bargaining agent and the governing board, if the governing board is then in existence, establish a combined list of educational support personnel in participating districts, categorized by positions, showing the length of continuing service of each full-time educational support personnel employee who is qualified to hold any such position at the cooperative elementary school or cooperative high school, or both, and then distribute this list to the exclusive employee representative or bargaining agent on or before February 1 of the school year prior to the commencement of the operation of the cooperative elementary school or cooperative high school, or both or within 30 days after the date of the board resolutions, whichever occurs first; and
        (3) transfer to the governing board of the
    	
cooperative elementary school or cooperative high school, or both the employment and the positions of so many of the full-time educational support personnel employees employed by a participating district as are jointly determined by the school boards of the participating districts and the governing board, if the governing board is then in existence, to be needed at the cooperative elementary school or cooperative high school, or both, provided that the full-time educational personnel employee transfers shall be done by categories on the seniority list mentioned in item (2) of this subsection (f) and done in order from greatest seniority first through lesser amounts of seniority.
    If there are more full-time educational support personnel employees than there are available positions at the cooperative elementary school or cooperative high school, or both or in the participating district, then a school board shall first remove or dismiss those educational support personnel employees with the shorter length of continuing service in any of the participating districts, within the respective category of position. The governing board is subject to this Code with respect to the educational support personnel employee as if the educational support personnel employee had been the governing board's employee during the time the educational support personnel employee was actually employed by the school board of the district from which the employment and position were transferred. Any educational support personnel employee dismissed as a result of such a decrease shall be paid all earned compensation on or before the third business day following his or her last day of employment. If the school board that has dismissed the educational support personnel employee or the governing board has any vacancies for the following school term or within one calendar year from the beginning of the following school term, then the positions thereby becoming available within a specific category of position shall be tendered to the employees so removed or dismissed from that category of position so far as they are legally qualified to hold such positions. At the conclusion of the pilot, any educational support personnel employee who was transferred from a participating district shall be transferred back to the district and Section 10-23.5 of this Code shall apply. In that case, a district is subject to this Code in the same manner as if the educational support personnel employee transferred back had been continuously in the service of the receiving district.
    (g) This Section repeals 3 years after the beginning date of operation of a pilot cooperative elementary school or a pilot cooperative high school.

    Sec. 10-22.22e. Science and mathematics partnership school.
    (a) Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary and subject to the provisions of this Section, 2 or more contiguous school districts with all or a portion of their territory located within the geographic boundaries of the same municipality may, when in their judgment the interest of the districts and of the students therein will be best served, jointly operate, through an institution of higher education located in the municipality, a science and mathematics partnership school for serving some or all of grades kindergarten through 8. The partnership school may (i) restrict attendance to pupils who reside within the geographic boundaries of the areas served by the school districts and (ii) select students for enrollment based on admission criteria that focuses on academic proficiency in science and mathematics established by the partnership school and approved by the districts' school boards; however, in no case may the partnership school discriminate on the basis of disability, race, creed, color, gender, national origin, religion, ancestry, marital status, or need for special education services in the establishment of its attendance boundaries or in the selection of students for enrollment. The number of students enrolled from each school district shall be approximately equal in number. If there are more students eligible for enrollment in the partnership school from a school district than there are spaces available, eligible students must be selected by lottery.
    (b) The school board of each school district shall, by proper resolution, enter into the joint operation of the partnership school. The school boards of the participating districts shall execute a partnership school contract with the institution of higher education for the joint operation, subject to the provisions of this Section. The agreement for joint operation of the partnership school shall include, but not be limited to, provisions for administration, staff, programs, financing, facilities, and transportation.
    (c) Each participating school district shall pay its per capita cost of educating the students residing in the district and attending the partnership school for the maintenance and operation of the partnership school. The manner of determining per capita cost must be set forth in the agreement. Each district shall pay the amount owed under the terms of the agreement from the fund that the district would have used if the district had incurred the costs directly and may levy taxes and issue bonds as otherwise authorized for these purposes in order to make payments.
    (d) The teachers and other non-administrative, certified employees who work in the partnership school must be selected according to criteria established by the partnership school and agreed to by the school districts' school boards. The number of such employees selected from each school district must be approximately equal in number. Their selection must be for a 2-year or 4-year period, upon the completion of which they must be assigned to a comparable position in the school from which they were selected. While working in the partnership school, these employees shall remain employees of and be paid by the school district from which they were selected, and their wages and benefits must be the same as if they were teaching or otherwise working in that district, provided that additional wages and benefits may be provided to these teachers and other staff if the participating school districts and the exclusive bargaining representatives of their teachers and other staff agree. The contractual continued service status of a teacher and the retirement benefits of those employees who accept work with the partnership school must not be affected. A school term worked in the partnership school must be considered a school term worked in the school district from which the employees were selected for contractual continued service attainment purposes. The time spent in employment with a participating district by any teacher who has not yet entered upon contractual continued service and accepts selection to work in the partnership school is not lost when computing the time necessary for the teacher to enter upon contractual continued service.

    Sec. 10-22.29a. To authorize the establishment of an investment club, in any high school within the district, to be organized on a purely voluntary basis. The State Board of Education may, however, promulgate reasonable standards regarding the establishment, organization and operation of investment clubs formed pursuant to this Section which standards must be complied with by all those concerned. The superintendent of schools shall, when the board has authorized the establishment of an investment club, designate a teacher in the high school where the club is organized to serve as sponsor of the club and as the fiduciary for members of the club in making the purchases and sales of securities on behalf of the members and shall also designate an investment dealer registered with the Secretary of State of Illinois as an investment dealer; to provide investment counseling and brokerage services for the members of the club. That investment dealer shall (a) reflect all transactions entered into on behalf of the investment club in an account in the name of the teacher as fiduciary, (b) submit monthly to the fiduciary a statement of account reflecting all transactions entered into on behalf of the club during the previous month including the prices paid on purchases and the proceeds received on sales of securities and the costs and fees incurred in each transaction and listing the accumulated holdings of the investment club by type of security, number of shares of stock, name of the issuer and any other information necessary to identify the composition of the accumulated security holdings of the club, and (c) handle transactions on behalf of the club, through the designated fiduciary as a street account rather than through issuance of certificates in the name of the fiduciary or of individual club members. Any investment club formed under this Section must sell all securities purchased through the club and distribute the proceeds of sales to its members by May 20th each year. All investment clubs are subject to the provisions of the Illinois Securities Law of 1953.

    Sec. 10-22.31. Special education.
    (a) To enter into joint agreements with other school boards to provide the needed special educational facilities and to employ a director and other professional workers as defined in Section 14-1.10 and to establish facilities as defined in Section 14-1.08 for the types of children described in Sections 14-1.02 and 14-1.03a. The director (who may be employed under a contract as provided in subsection (c) of this Section) and other professional workers may be employed by one district, which shall be reimbursed on a mutually agreed basis by other districts that are parties to the joint agreement. Such agreements may provide that one district may supply professional workers for a joint program conducted in another district. Such agreement shall provide that any full-time professional worker who is employed by a joint agreement program and spends over 50% of his or her time in one school district shall not be required to work a different teaching schedule than the other professional worker in that district. Such agreement shall include, but not be limited to, provisions for administration, staff, programs, financing, housing, transportation, an advisory body, and the method or methods to be employed for disposing of property upon the withdrawal of a school district or dissolution of the joint agreement and shall specify procedures for the withdrawal of districts from the joint agreement as long as these procedures are consistent with this Section. Such agreement may be amended at any time as provided in the joint agreement or, if the joint agreement does not so provide, then such agreement may be amended at any time upon the adoption of concurring resolutions by the school boards of all member districts, provided that no later than 6 months after August 28, 2009 (the effective date of Public Act 96-783), all existing agreements shall be amended to be consistent with Public Act 96-783. Such an amendment may include the removal of a school district from or the addition of a school district to the joint agreement without a petition as otherwise required in this Section if all member districts adopt concurring resolutions to that effect. A fully executed copy of any such agreement or amendment entered into on or after January 1, 1989 shall be filed with the State Board of Education. Petitions for withdrawal shall be made to the regional board or boards of school trustees exercising oversight or governance over any of the districts in the joint agreement. Upon receipt of a petition for withdrawal, the regional board of school trustees shall publish notice of and conduct a hearing or, in instances in which more than one regional board of school trustees exercises oversight or governance over any of the districts in the joint agreement, a joint hearing, in accordance with rules adopted by the State Board of Education. In instances in which a single regional board of school trustees holds the hearing, approval of the petition must be by a two-thirds majority vote of the school trustees. In instances in which a joint hearing of 2 or more regional boards of school trustees is required, approval of the petition must be by a two-thirds majority of all those school trustees present and voting. Notwithstanding the provisions of Article 6 of this Code, in instances in which the competent regional board or boards of school trustees has been abolished, petitions for withdrawal shall be made to the school boards of those districts that fall under the oversight or governance of the abolished regional board of school trustees in accordance with rules adopted by the State Board of Education. If any petition is approved pursuant to this subsection (a), the withdrawal takes effect as provided in Section 7-9 of this Act. The changes to this Section made by Public Act 96-769 apply to all changes to special education joint agreement membership initiated after July 1, 2009.
    (b) To either (1) designate an administrative district to act as fiscal and legal agent for the districts that are parties to the joint agreement, or (2) designate a governing board composed of one member of the school board of each cooperating district and designated by such boards to act in accordance with the joint agreement. No such governing board may levy taxes and no such governing board may incur any indebtedness except within an annual budget for the joint agreement approved by the governing board and by the boards of at least a majority of the cooperating school districts or a number of districts greater than a majority if required by the joint agreement. The governing board may appoint an executive board of at least 7 members to administer the joint agreement in accordance with its terms. However, if 7 or more school districts are parties to a joint agreement that does not have an administrative district: (i) at least a majority of the members appointed by the governing board to the executive board shall be members of the school boards of the cooperating districts; or (ii) if the governing board wishes to appoint members who are not school board members, they shall be superintendents from the cooperating districts.
    (c) To employ a full-time director of special education of the joint agreement program under a one-year or multi-year contract. No such contract can be offered or accepted for less than one year. Such contract may be discontinued at any time by mutual agreement of the contracting parties, or may be extended for an additional one-year or multi-year period at the end of any year.
    The contract year is July 1 through the following June 30th, unless the contract specifically provides otherwise. Notice of intent not to renew a contract when given by a controlling board or administrative district must be in writing stating the specific reason therefor. Notice of intent not to renew the contract must be given by the controlling board or the administrative district at least 90 days before the contract expires. Failure to do so will automatically extend the contract for one additional year.
    By accepting the terms of the contract, the director of a special education joint agreement waives all rights granted under Sections 24-11 through 24-16 for the duration of his or her employment as a director of a special education joint agreement.
    (d) To designate a district that is a party to the joint agreement as the issuer of bonds or notes for the purposes and in the manner provided in this Section. It is not necessary for such district to also be the administrative district for the joint agreement, nor is it necessary for the same district to be designated as the issuer of all series of bonds or notes issued hereunder. Any district so designated may, from time to time, borrow money and, in evidence of its obligation to repay the borrowing, issue its negotiable bonds or notes for the purpose of acquiring, constructing, altering, repairing, enlarging and equipping any building or portion thereof, together with any land or interest therein, necessary to provide special educational facilities and services as defined in Section 14-1.08. Title in and to any such facilities shall be held in accordance with the joint agreement.
    Any such bonds or notes shall be authorized by a resolution of the board of education of the issuing district. The resolution may contain such covenants as may be deemed necessary or advisable by the district to assure the payment of the bonds or notes. The resolution shall be effective immediately upon its adoption.
    Prior to the issuance of such bonds or notes, each school district that is a party to the joint agreement shall agree, whether by amendment to the joint agreement or by resolution of the board of education, to be jointly and severally liable for the payment of the bonds and notes. The bonds or notes shall be payable solely and only from the payments made pursuant to such agreement.
    Neither the bonds or notes nor the obligation to pay the bonds or notes under any joint agreement shall constitute an indebtedness of any district, including the issuing district, within the meaning of any constitutional or statutory limitation.
    As long as any bonds or notes are outstanding and unpaid, the agreement by a district to pay the bonds and notes shall be irrevocable notwithstanding the district's withdrawal from membership in the joint special education program.
    (e) If a district whose employees are on strike was, prior to the strike, sending students with disabilities to special educational facilities and services in another district or cooperative, the district affected by the strike shall continue to send such students during the strike and shall be eligible to receive appropriate State reimbursement.
    (f) With respect to those joint agreements that have a governing board composed of one member of the school board of each cooperating district and designated by those boards to act in accordance with the joint agreement, the governing board shall have, in addition to its other powers under this Section, the authority to issue bonds or notes for the purposes and in the manner provided in this subsection. The governing board of the joint agreement may from time to time borrow money and, in evidence of its obligation to repay the borrowing, issue its negotiable bonds or notes for the purpose of acquiring, constructing, altering, repairing, enlarging and equipping any building or portion thereof, together with any land or interest therein, necessary to provide special educational facilities and services as defined in Section 14-1.08 and including also facilities for activities of administration and educational support personnel employees. Title in and to any such facilities shall be held in accordance with the joint agreement.
    Any such bonds or notes shall be authorized by a resolution of the governing board. The resolution may contain such covenants as may be deemed necessary or advisable by the governing board to assure the payment of the bonds or notes and interest accruing thereon. The resolution shall be effective immediately upon its adoption.
    Each school district that is a party to the joint agreement shall be automatically liable, by virtue of its membership in the joint agreement, for its proportionate share of the principal amount of the bonds and notes plus interest accruing thereon, as provided in the resolution. Subject to the joint and several liability hereinafter provided for, the resolution may provide for different payment schedules for different districts except that the aggregate amount of scheduled payments for each district shall be equal to its proportionate share of the debt service in the bonds or notes based upon the fraction that its equalized assessed valuation bears to the total equalized assessed valuation of all the district members of the joint agreement as adjusted in the manner hereinafter provided. In computing that fraction the most recent available equalized assessed valuation at the time of the issuance of the bonds and notes shall be used, and the equalized assessed valuation of any district maintaining grades K to 12 shall be doubled in both the numerator and denominator of the fraction used for all of the districts that are members of the joint agreement. In case of default in payment by any member, each school district that is a party to the joint agreement shall automatically be jointly and severally liable for the amount of any deficiency. The bonds or notes and interest thereon shall be payable solely and only from the funds made available pursuant to the procedures set forth in this subsection. No project authorized under this subsection may require an annual contribution for bond payments from any member district in excess of 0.15% of the value of taxable property as equalized or assessed by the Department of Revenue in the case of districts maintaining grades K-8 or 9-12 and 0.30% of the value of taxable property as equalized or assessed by the Department of Revenue in the case of districts maintaining grades K-12. This limitation on taxing authority is expressly applicable to taxing authority provided under Section 17-9 and other applicable Sections of this Act. Nothing contained in this subsection shall be construed as an exception to the property tax limitations contained in Section 17-2, 17-2.2a, 17-5, or any other applicable Section of this Act.
    Neither the bonds or notes nor the obligation to pay the bonds or notes under any joint agreement shall constitute an indebtedness of any district within the meaning of any constitutional or statutory limitation.
    As long as any bonds or notes are outstanding and unpaid, the obligation of a district to pay its proportionate share of the principal of and interest on the bonds and notes as required in this Section shall be a general obligation of the district payable from any and all sources of revenue designated for that purpose by the board of education of the district and shall be irrevocable notwithstanding the district's withdrawal from membership in the joint special education program.
    (g) A member district wishing to withdraw from a joint agreement may obtain from its school board a written resolution approving the withdrawal. The withdrawing district must then present a written petition for withdrawal from the joint agreement to the other member districts. Under no circumstances may the petition be presented to the other member districts less than 12 months from the date of the proposed withdrawal, unless the member districts agree to waive this timeline. Upon approval by school board written resolution of all of the remaining member districts, the petitioning member district shall notify the State Board of Education of the approved withdrawal in writing and must submit a comprehensive plan developed under subsection (g-5) for review by the State Board. If the petition for withdrawal is not approved, the petitioning member district may appeal the disapproval decision to the trustees of schools of the township that has jurisdiction and authority over the withdrawing district. If a withdrawing district is not under the jurisdiction and authority of the trustees of schools of a township, a hearing panel shall be established by the chief administrative officer of the intermediate service center having jurisdiction over the withdrawing district. The hearing panel shall be made up of 3 persons who have a demonstrated interest and background in education. Each hearing panel member must reside within an educational service region of 2,000,000 or more inhabitants but not within the withdrawing district and may not be a current school board member or employee of the withdrawing district or hold any county office. None of the hearing panel members may reside within the same school district. The hearing panel shall serve without remuneration; however, the necessary expenses, including travel, attendant upon any meeting or hearing in relation to these proceedings must be paid. Prior to the hearing, the withdrawing district shall (i) provide written notification to all parents or guardians of students with disabilities residing within the district of its intent to withdraw from the special education joint agreement; (ii) hold a public hearing to allow for members of the community, parents or guardians of students with disabilities, or any other interested parties an opportunity to review the plan for educating students after the withdrawal and to provide feedback on the plan; and (iii) prepare and provide a comprehensive plan as outlined under subsection (g-5). The trustees of schools of the township having jurisdiction and authority over the withdrawing district or the hearing panel established by the chief administrative officer of the intermediate service center having jurisdiction over the withdrawing district shall convene and hear testimony to determine whether the withdrawing district has presented sufficient evidence that the district, standing alone, will provide a full continuum of services and support to all its students with disabilities in the foreseeable future. If the trustees of schools of the township having jurisdiction and authority over the withdrawing district or the hearing panel established by the chief administrative officer of the intermediate service center having jurisdiction over the withdrawing district approves the petition for withdrawal, then the petitioning member district shall be withdrawn from the joint agreement effective the following July 1 and shall notify the State Board of Education of the approved withdrawal in writing.
    (g-5) Each withdrawing district shall develop a comprehensive plan that includes the administrative policies and procedures outlined in Sections 226.50, 226.100, 226.110, 226.180, 226.230, 226.250, 226.260, 226.300, 226.310, 226.320, 226.330, 226.340, 226.350, 226.500, 226.520, 226.530, 226.540, 226.560, 226.700, 226.740, 226.800, and 226.820 and Subpart G of Part 226 of Title 23 of the Illinois Administrative Code and all relevant portions of the federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. The withdrawing district must also demonstrate its ability to provide education for a wide range of students with disabilities, including a full continuum of support and services. To demonstrate an appropriate plan for educating all currently enrolled students with disabilities upon withdrawal from the joint agreement, the withdrawing district must provide a written plan for educating and placing all currently eligible students with disabilities.
    (h) The changes to this Section made by Public Act 96-783 apply to withdrawals from or dissolutions of special education joint agreements initiated after August 28, 2009 (the effective date of Public Act 96-783).
    (i) Notwithstanding subsections (a), (g), and (h) of this Section or any other provision of this Code to the contrary, an elementary school district that maintains grades up to and including grade 8, that had a 2014-2015 best 3 months' average daily attendance of 5,209.57, and that had a 2014 equalized assessed valuation of at least $451,500,000, but not more than $452,000,000, may withdraw from its special education joint agreement program consisting of 6 school districts upon submission and approval of the comprehensive plan, in compliance with the applicable requirements of Section 14-4.01 of this Code, in addition to the approval by the school board of the elementary school district and notification to and the filing of an intent to withdraw statement with the governing board of the joint agreement program. Such notification and statement shall specify the effective date of the withdrawal, which in no case shall be less than 60 days after the date of the filing of the notification and statement. Upon receipt of the notification and statement, the governing board of the joint agreement program shall distribute a copy to each member district of the joint agreement and shall initiate any appropriate allocation of assets and liabilities among the remaining member districts to take effect upon the date of the withdrawal. The withdrawal shall take effect upon the date specified in the notification and statement.

    (a) School Boards may employ non-teaching personnel or utilize volunteer personnel for: (1) non-teaching duties not requiring instructional judgment or evaluation of pupils; and (2) supervising study halls, long distance teaching reception areas used incident to instructional programs transmitted by electronic media such as computers, video, and audio, and detention and discipline areas, and school-sponsored extracurricular activities.

    (a) To employ such educational support personnel employees as it deems advisable and to define their employment duties; provided that residency within any school district shall not be considered in determining the employment or the compensation of any such employee, or whether to retain, promote, assign or transfer such employee. If an educational support personnel employee is removed or dismissed or the hours he or she works are reduced as a result of a decision of the school board (i) to decrease the number of educational support personnel employees employed by the board or (ii) to discontinue some particular type of educational support service, written notice shall be mailed to the employee and also given to the employee either by certified mail, return receipt requested, or personal delivery with receipt, at least 30 days before the employee is removed or dismissed or the hours he or she works are reduced, together with a statement of honorable dismissal and the reason therefor if applicable. However, if a reduction in hours is due to an unforeseen reduction in the student population, then the written notice must be mailed and given to the employee at least 5 days before the hours are reduced. The employee with the shorter length of continuing service with the district, within the respective category of position, shall be dismissed first unless an alternative method of determining the sequence of dismissal is established in a collective bargaining agreement or contract between the board and any exclusive bargaining agent and except that this provision shall not impair the operation of any affirmative action program in the district, regardless of whether it exists by operation of law or is conducted on a voluntary basis by the board. If the board has any vacancies for the following school term or within one calendar year from the beginning of the following school term, the positions thereby becoming available within a specific category of position shall be tendered to the employees so removed or dismissed from that category or any other category of position, so far as they are qualified to hold such positions. Each board shall, in consultation with any exclusive employee representative or bargaining agent, each year establish a list, categorized by positions, showing the length of continuing service of each full time educational support personnel employee who is qualified to hold any such positions, unless an alternative method of determining a sequence of dismissal is established as provided for in this Section, in which case a list shall be made in accordance with the alternative method. Copies of the list shall be distributed to the exclusive employee representative or bargaining agent on or before February 1 of each year.
    If an educational support personnel employee is removed or dismissed as a result of a decision of the board to decrease the number of educational support personnel employed by the board or to discontinue some particular type of educational support service and he or she accepts the tender of a vacancy within one calendar year from the beginning of the following school term, then that employee shall maintain any rights accrued during his or her previous service with the school district.
    Where an educational support personnel employee is dismissed by the board as a result of a decrease in the number of employees or the discontinuance of the employee's job, the employee shall be paid all earned compensation on or before the next regular pay date following his or her last day of employment.
    The provisions of this amendatory Act of 1986 relating to residency within any school district shall not apply to cities having a population exceeding 500,000 inhabitants.
    (b) In the case of a new school district or districts formed in accordance with Article 11E of this Code, a school district or districts that annex all of the territory of one or more entire other school districts in accordance with Article 7 of this Code, or a school district receiving students from a deactivated school facility in accordance with Section 10-22.22b of this Code, the employment of educational support personnel in the new, annexing, or receiving school district immediately following the reorganization shall be governed by this subsection (b). Lists of the educational support personnel employed in the individual districts for the school year immediately prior to the effective date of the new district or districts, annexation, or deactivation shall be combined for the districts forming the new district or districts, for the annexed and annexing districts, or for the deactivating and receiving districts, as the case may be. The combined list shall be categorized by positions, showing the length of continuing service of each full-time educational support personnel employee who is qualified to hold any such position. If there are more full-time educational support personnel employees on the combined list than there are available positions in the new, annexing, or receiving school district, then the employing school board shall first remove or dismiss those educational support personnel employees with the shorter length of continuing service within the respective category of position, following the procedures outlined in subsection (a) of this Section. The employment and position of each educational support personnel employee on the combined list not so removed or dismissed shall be transferred to the new, annexing, or receiving school board, and the new, annexing, or receiving school board is subject to this Code with respect to any educational support personnel employee so transferred as if the educational support personnel employee had been the new, annexing, or receiving board's employee during the time the educational support personnel employee was actually employed by the school board of the district from which the employment and position were transferred.
    The changes made by Public Act 95-148 shall not apply to the formation of a new district or districts in accordance with Article 11E of this Code, the annexation of one or more entire districts in accordance with Article 7 of this Code, or the deactivation of a school facility in accordance with Section 10-22.22b of this Code effective on or before July 1, 2007.

shall be posted on the district's Internet website where other policies, rules, and standards of conduct are posted and shall be provided to students and faculty.
        (7) This Section does not create any additional
    	
employee bargaining rights and does not remove any employee bargaining rights.
        (8) Statutory and regulatory curricular mandates and
    	
offerings may be administered via a district's remote and blended remote learning day plan, except that a district may not offer individual behind-the-wheel instruction required by Section 27-24.2 via a district's remote and blended remote learning day plan. This Section does not relieve schools and districts from completing all statutory and regulatory curricular mandates and offerings.

optional elementary unit district from a combination of a substantially coterminous dual district; or
            (K) for or against dissolving and becoming part
        	
of an optional elementary unit district.
        (2) A description of the territory comprising the

        (3) A specification of the maximum tax rates for
    	
various purposes the proposed district or districts shall be authorized to levy for various purposes and, if applicable, the specifications related to the Property Tax Extension Limitation Law, in accordance with Section 11E-80 of this Code.
        (4) A description of how supplementary State deficit

        (5) Where applicable, a division of assets and
    	
liabilities to be allocated to the proposed new or annexing school district or districts in the manner provided in Section 11E-105 of this Code.
        (6) If desired, a request that at that same election
    	
as the reorganization proposition a school board or boards be elected on a separate ballot or ballots to serve as the school board or boards of the proposed new district or districts. Any election of board members at the same election at which the proposition to create the district or districts to be served by the board or boards is submitted to the voters shall proceed under the supervision of the regional superintendent of schools as provided in Section 11E-55 of this Code.
        (7) If desired, a request that the referendum at
    	
which the proposition is submitted for the purpose of voting for or against the establishment of a unit district (other than a partial elementary unit district) include as part of the proposition the election of board members by school board district rather than at large. Any petition requesting the election of board members by district shall divide the proposed school district into 7 school board districts, each of which must be compact and contiguous and substantially equal in population to each other school board district. Any election of board members by school board district shall proceed under the supervision of the regional superintendent of schools as provided in Section 11E-55 of this Code.
        (8) If desired, a request that the referendum at

The format for the election of the new high school board must be defined in the petition. When 4 or more unit school districts and a combination of board members representing each of the forming elementary school districts are involved and at large formats are used, one member must be elected from each of the forming elementary school districts. The remaining members may be elected on an at large basis, provided that none of the underlying elementary school districts have a majority on the resulting high school board. When 3 unit school districts and a combination of board members representing each of the forming elementary school districts are involved and at large formats are used, 2 members must be elected from each of the forming elementary school districts. The remaining member must be elected at large.
        (9) If desired, a request that the referendum at
    	
which the proposition shall be submitted include a proposition on a separate ballot authorizing the issuance of bonds by the district or districts when organized in accordance with this Article. However, if the petition is submitted for the purpose of voting for or against the establishment of an optional elementary unit district, the petition may request only that the referendum at which the proposition is submitted include a proposition on a separate ballot authorizing the issuance of bonds for high school purposes (and not elementary purposes) by the district when organized in accordance with this Article. The principal amount of the bonds and the purposes of issuance, including a specification of elementary or high school purposes if the proposed issuance is to be made by a combined high school - unit district, shall be stated in the petition and in all notices and propositions submitted thereunder. Only residents in the territory of the district proposing the bond issuance may vote on the bond issuance.
        (10) A designation of a committee of ten of the
    	
petitioners as attorney in fact for all petitioners, any 7 of whom may at any time, prior to the final decision of the regional superintendent of schools, amend the petition in all respects (except that, for a unit district formation, there may not be an increase or decrease of more than 25% of the territory to be included in the proposed district) and make binding stipulations on behalf of all petitioners as to any question with respect to the petition, including the power to stipulate to accountings or the waiver thereof between school districts.
    (c) The regional superintendent of schools shall not accept for filing under the authority of this Section any petition that includes any territory already included as part of the territory described in another pending petition filed under the authority of this Section.
    (d)(1) Those designated as the Committee of Ten shall serve in that capacity until such time as the regional superintendent of schools determines that, because of death, resignation, transfer of residency from the territory, failure to qualify, or any other reason, the office of a particular member of the Committee of Ten is vacant. Upon determination by the regional superintendent of schools that these vacancies exist, he or she shall declare the vacancies and shall notify the remaining members to appoint a petitioner or petitioners, as the case may be, to fill the vacancies in the Committee of Ten so designated. An appointment by the Committee of Ten to fill a vacancy shall be made by a simple majority vote of the designated remaining members.
    (2) Failure of a person designated as a member of the Committee of Ten to sign the petition shall not disqualify that person as a member of the Committee of Ten, and that person may sign the petition at any time prior to final disposition of the petition and the conclusion of the proceedings to form a new school district or districts, including all litigation pertaining to the petition or proceedings.
    (3) Except as stated in item (10) of subsection (b) of this Section, the Committee of Ten shall act by majority vote of the membership.
    (4) The regional superintendent of schools may accept a stipulation made by the Committee of Ten instead of evidence or proof of the matter stipulated or may refuse to accept the stipulation, provided that the regional superintendent sets forth the basis for the refusal.
    (5) The Committee of Ten may voluntarily dismiss its petition at any time before a final decision is issued by the State Superintendent of Education.

    With respect to each position to be transferred under the provisions of this subsection (a), the amount of time required of each position to be spent in one or more of grades kindergarten through 8 and 9 through 12 shall be determined with reference to the applicable records of the unit district being dissolved pursuant to stipulation of the school board of the unit district prior to the effective date of its dissolution or thereafter of the school board of the newly created districts and with the approval in either case of the regional superintendent of schools of the educational service region in which the territory described in the petition filed under this Article or the greater percentage of equalized assessed evaluation of the territory is situated; however, if no such stipulation can be agreed upon, the regional superintendent of schools, after hearing any additional relevant and material evidence that any school board desires to submit, shall make the determination.
    (a-5) When a school district conversion or multi-unit conversion becomes effective for purposes of administration and attendance, as determined pursuant to Section 11E-70 of this Code, the provisions of subsection (b) of Section 10-23.5 of this Code relative to the transfer of educational support personnel employees shall apply, and the positions held by educational support personnel employees shall be transferred on the following basis:
        (1) positions of educational support personnel
    	
employees that, during the 5 school years immediately preceding the effective date of the change, as determined under Section 11E-70 of this Code, were full-time positions in which all of the time required of the position was spent in one or more of grades 9 through 12 shall be transferred to the control of the school board of the new high school district or combined high school - unit district, as the case may be;
        (2) positions of educational support personnel
    	
employees that, during the 5 school years immediately preceding the effective date of the change, as determined under Section 11E-70 of this Code, were full-time positions in which all of the time required of the position was spent in one or more of grades kindergarten through 8 shall be transferred to the control of the school board of the newly created successor elementary district; and
        (3) positions of educational support personnel
    	
employees that were full-time positions not required to be transferred to the control of the school board of the new high school district or combined high school - unit district, as the case may be, or the school board of the newly created successor elementary district under subdivision (1) or (2) of this subsection (a-5) shall be transferred to the control of whichever of the boards the educational support personnel employee requests.
    With respect to each position to be transferred under this subsection (a-5), the amount of time required of each position to be spent in one or more of grades kindergarten through 8 and 9 through 12 shall be determined with reference to the applicable records of the unit district being dissolved pursuant to stipulation of the school board of the unit district prior to the effective date of its dissolution or thereafter of the school board of the newly created districts and with the approval in either case of the regional superintendent of schools of the educational service region in which the territory described in the petition filed under this Article or the greater percentage of equalized assessed evaluation of the territory is situated; however, if no such stipulation can be agreed upon, the regional superintendent of schools, after hearing any additional relevant and material evidence that any school board desires to submit, shall make the determination.
    (b) When the creation of a unit district or a combined school district becomes effective for purposes of administration and attendance, as determined pursuant to Section 11E-70 of this Code, the positions of teachers in contractual continued service in the districts involved in the creation of the new district are transferred to the newly created district pursuant to the provisions of subsection (h) of Section 24-11 of this Code relative to teachers having contractual continued service status whose positions are transferred from one board to the control of a different board, and those provisions of subsection (h) of Section 24-11 of this Code shall apply to these transferred teachers. The contractual continued service status of any teacher thereby transferred to the newly created district is not lost and the new school board is subject to this Code with respect to the transferred teacher in the same manner as if the teacher was that district's employee and had been its employee during the time the teacher was actually employed by the school board of the district from which the position was transferred.
    (c) When the creation of a unit district or a combined school district becomes effective for purposes of administration and attendance, as determined pursuant to Section 11E-70 of this Code, the positions of educational support personnel employees in the districts involved in the creation of the new district shall be transferred to the newly created district pursuant to subsection (b) of Section 10-23.5 of this Code. The length of continuing service of any educational support personnel employee thereby transferred to the newly created district is not lost and the new school board is subject to this Code with respect to the transferred educational support personnel employee in the same manner as if the educational support personnel employee had been that district's employee during the time the educational support personnel employee was actually employed by the school board of the district from which the position was transferred.

    Sec. 11E-130. Unit district formation and joint agreement vocational education program.
    (a) If a unit district is established under the provisions of this Article and more than 50% of the territory of the unit district is territory that immediately prior to its inclusion in the unit district was included in a high school district or districts that were signatories under the same joint agreement vocational education program, pursuant to the provisions of this Code, then the unit district shall upon its establishment be deemed to be a member and signatory to the joint agreement and shall also have the right to continue to extend taxes under any previous authority to levy a tax under Section 17-2.4 of this Code.
    (b) In those instances, however, when more than 50% of the territory of any unit district was not, immediately prior to its establishment, included within the territory of a high school district that was a signatory to the same joint agreement vocational education program, then the unit district shall not be deemed upon its establishment to be a signatory to the joint agreement nor shall the unit district be deemed to have the special tax levy rights under Section 17-2.4 of this Code.

    Sec. 11E-135. Incentives. For districts reorganizing under this Article and for a district or districts that annex all of the territory of one or more entire other school districts in accordance with Article 7 of this Code, the following payments shall be made from appropriations made for these purposes:
    (a)(1) For a combined school district, as defined in Section 11E-20 of this Code, or for a unit district, as defined in Section 11E-25 of this Code, for its first year of existence, the general State aid and supplemental general State aid calculated under Section 18-8.05 of this Code or the evidence-based funding calculated under Section 18-8.15 of this Code, as applicable, shall be computed for the new district and for the previously existing districts for which property is totally included within the new district. If the computation on the basis of the previously existing districts is greater, a supplementary payment equal to the difference shall be made for the first 4 years of existence of the new district.
    (2) For a school district that annexes all of the territory of one or more entire other school districts as defined in Article 7 of this Code, for the first year during which the change of boundaries attributable to the annexation becomes effective for all purposes, as determined under Section 7-9 of this Code, the general State aid and supplemental general State aid calculated under Section 18-8.05 of this Code or the evidence-based funding calculated under Section 18-8.15 of this Code, as applicable, shall be computed for the annexing district as constituted after the annexation and for the annexing and each annexed district as constituted prior to the annexation; and if the computation on the basis of the annexing and annexed districts as constituted prior to the annexation is greater, then a supplementary payment equal to the difference shall be made for the first 4 years of existence of the annexing school district as constituted upon the annexation.
    (3) For 2 or more school districts that annex all of the territory of one or more entire other school districts, as defined in Article 7 of this Code, for the first year during which the change of boundaries attributable to the annexation becomes effective for all purposes, as determined under Section 7-9 of this Code, the general State aid and supplemental general State aid calculated under Section 18-8.05 of this Code or the evidence-based funding calculated under Section 18-8.15 of this Code, as applicable, shall be computed for each annexing district as constituted after the annexation and for each annexing and annexed district as constituted prior to the annexation; and if the aggregate of the general State aid and supplemental general State aid or evidence-based funding, as applicable, as so computed for the annexing districts as constituted after the annexation is less than the aggregate of the general State aid and supplemental general State aid or evidence-based funding, as applicable, as so computed for the annexing and annexed districts, as constituted prior to the annexation, then a supplementary payment equal to the difference shall be made and allocated between or among the annexing districts, as constituted upon the annexation, for the first 4 years of their existence. The total difference payment shall be allocated between or among the annexing districts in the same ratio as the pupil enrollment from that portion of the annexed district or districts that is annexed to each annexing district bears to the total pupil enrollment from the entire annexed district or districts, as such pupil enrollment is determined for the school year last ending prior to the date when the change of boundaries attributable to the annexation becomes effective for all purposes. The amount of the total difference payment and the amount thereof to be allocated to the annexing districts shall be computed by the State Board of Education on the basis of pupil enrollment and other data that shall be certified to the State Board of Education, on forms that it shall provide for that purpose, by the regional superintendent of schools for each educational service region in which the annexing and annexed districts are located.
    (4) For a school district conversion, as defined in Section 11E-15 of this Code, or a multi-unit conversion, as defined in subsection (b) of Section 11E-30 of this Code, if in their first year of existence the newly created elementary districts and the newly created high school district, from a school district conversion, or the newly created elementary district or districts and newly created combined high school - unit district, from a multi-unit conversion, qualify for less general State aid under Section 18-8.05 of this Code or evidence-based funding under Section 18-8.15 of this Code than would have been payable under Section 18-8.05 or 18-8.15, as applicable, for that same year to the previously existing districts, then a supplementary payment equal to that difference shall be made for the first 4 years of existence of the newly created districts. The aggregate amount of each supplementary payment shall be allocated among the newly created districts in the proportion that the deemed pupil enrollment in each district during its first year of existence bears to the actual aggregate pupil enrollment in all of the districts during their first year of existence. For purposes of each allocation:
        (A) the deemed pupil enrollment of the newly created
    	
high school district from a school district conversion shall be an amount equal to its actual pupil enrollment for its first year of existence multiplied by 1.25;
        (B) the deemed pupil enrollment of each newly created
    	
elementary district from a school district conversion shall be an amount equal to its actual pupil enrollment for its first year of existence reduced by an amount equal to the product obtained when the amount by which the newly created high school district's deemed pupil enrollment exceeds its actual pupil enrollment for its first year of existence is multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the actual pupil enrollment of the newly created elementary district for its first year of existence and the denominator of which is the actual aggregate pupil enrollment of all of the newly created elementary districts for their first year of existence;
        (C) the deemed high school pupil enrollment of the
    	
newly created combined high school - unit district from a multi-unit conversion shall be an amount equal to its actual grades 9 through 12 pupil enrollment for its first year of existence multiplied by 1.25; and
        (D) the deemed elementary pupil enrollment of each
    	
newly created district from a multi-unit conversion shall be an amount equal to each district's actual grade K through 8 pupil enrollment for its first year of existence, reduced by an amount equal to the product obtained when the amount by which the newly created combined high school - unit district's deemed high school pupil enrollment exceeds its actual grade 9 through 12 pupil enrollment for its first year of existence is multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the actual grade K through 8 pupil enrollment of each newly created district for its first year of existence and the denominator of which is the actual aggregate grade K through 8 pupil enrollment of all such newly created districts for their first year of existence.
    The aggregate amount of each supplementary payment under this subdivision (4) and the amount thereof to be allocated to the newly created districts shall be computed by the State Board of Education on the basis of pupil enrollment and other data, which shall be certified to the State Board of Education, on forms that it shall provide for that purpose, by the regional superintendent of schools for each educational service region in which the newly created districts are located.
    (5) For a partial elementary unit district, as defined in subsection (a) or (c) of Section 11E-30 of this Code, if, in the first year of existence, the newly created partial elementary unit district qualifies for less general State aid and supplemental general State aid under Section 18-8.05 of this Code or less evidence-based funding under Section 18-8.15 of this Code, as applicable, than would have been payable under those Sections for that same year to the previously existing districts that formed the partial elementary unit district, then a supplementary payment equal to that difference shall be made to the partial elementary unit district for the first 4 years of existence of that newly created district.
    (6) For an elementary opt-in, as described in subsection (d) of Section 11E-30 of this Code, the general State aid or evidence-based funding difference shall be computed in accordance with paragraph (5) of this subsection (a) as if the elementary opt-in was included in an optional elementary unit district at the optional elementary unit district's original effective date. If the calculation in this paragraph (6) is less than that calculated in paragraph (5) of this subsection (a) at the optional elementary unit district's original effective date, then no adjustments may be made. If the calculation in this paragraph (6) is more than that calculated in paragraph (5) of this subsection (a) at the optional elementary unit district's original effective date, then the excess must be paid as follows:
        (A) If the effective date for the elementary opt-in
    	
is one year after the effective date for the optional elementary unit district, 100% of the calculated excess shall be paid to the optional elementary unit district in each of the first 4 years after the effective date of the elementary opt-in.
        (B) If the effective date for the elementary opt-in
    	
is 2 years after the effective date for the optional elementary unit district, 75% of the calculated excess shall be paid to the optional elementary unit district in each of the first 4 years after the effective date of the elementary opt-in.
        (C) If the effective date for the elementary opt-in
    	
is 3 years after the effective date for the optional elementary unit district, 50% of the calculated excess shall be paid to the optional elementary unit district in each of the first 4 years after the effective date of the elementary opt-in.
        (D) If the effective date for the elementary opt-in
    	
is 4 years after the effective date for the optional elementary unit district, 25% of the calculated excess shall be paid to the optional elementary unit district in each of the first 4 years after the effective date of the elementary opt-in.
        (E) If the effective date for the elementary opt-in
    	
is 5 years after the effective date for the optional elementary unit district, the optional elementary unit district is not eligible for any additional incentives due to the elementary opt-in.
    (6.5) For a school district that annexes territory detached from another school district whereby the enrollment of the annexing district increases by 90% or more as a result of the annexation, for the first year during which the change of boundaries attributable to the annexation becomes effective for all purposes as determined under Section 7-9 of this Code, the general State aid and supplemental general State aid or evidence-based funding, as applicable, calculated under this Section shall be computed for the district gaining territory and the district losing territory as constituted after the annexation and for the same districts as constituted prior to the annexation; and if the aggregate of the general State aid and supplemental general State aid or evidence-based funding, as applicable, as so computed for the district gaining territory and the district losing territory as constituted after the annexation is less than the aggregate of the general State aid and supplemental general State aid or evidence-based funding, as applicable, as so computed for the district gaining territory and the district losing territory as constituted prior to the annexation, then a supplementary payment shall be made to the annexing district for the first 4 years of existence after the annexation, equal to the difference multiplied by the ratio of student enrollment in the territory detached to the total student enrollment in the district losing territory for the year prior to the effective date of the annexation. The amount of the total difference and the proportion paid to the annexing district shall be computed by the State Board of Education on the basis of pupil enrollment and other data that must be submitted to the State Board of Education in accordance with Section 7-14A of this Code. The changes to this Section made by Public Act 95-707 are intended to be retroactive and applicable to any annexation taking effect on or after July 1, 2004. For annexations that are eligible for payments under this paragraph (6.5) and that are effective on or after July 1, 2004, but before January 11, 2008 (the effective date of Public Act 95-707), the first required yearly payment under this paragraph (6.5) shall be paid in the fiscal year of January 11, 2008 (the effective date of Public Act 95-707). Subsequent required yearly payments shall be paid in subsequent fiscal years until the payment obligation under this paragraph (6.5) is complete.
    (7) Claims for financial assistance under this subsection (a) may not be recomputed except as expressly provided under Section 18-8.05 or 18-8.15 of this Code.
    (8) Any supplementary payment made under this subsection (a) must be treated as separate from all other payments made pursuant to Section 18-8.05 or 18-8.15 of this Code.
    (b)(1) After the formation of a combined school district, as defined in Section 11E-20 of this Code, or a unit district, as defined in Section 11E-25 of this Code, a computation shall be made to determine the difference between the salaries effective in each of the previously existing districts on June 30, prior to the creation of the new district. For the first 4 years after the formation of the new district, a supplementary State aid reimbursement shall be paid to the new district equal to the difference between the sum of the salaries earned by each of the certificated members of the new district, while employed in one of the previously existing districts during the year immediately preceding the formation of the new district, and the sum of the salaries those certificated members would have been paid during the year immediately prior to the formation of the new district if placed on the salary schedule of the previously existing district with the highest salary schedule.
    (2) After the territory of one or more school districts is annexed by one or more other school districts as defined in Article 7 of this Code, a computation shall be made to determine the difference between the salaries effective in each annexed district and in the annexing district or districts as they were each constituted on June 30 preceding the date when the change of boundaries attributable to the annexation became effective for all purposes, as determined under Section 7-9 of this Code. For the first 4 years after the annexation, a supplementary State aid reimbursement shall be paid to each annexing district as constituted after the annexation equal to the difference between the sum of the salaries earned by each of the certificated members of the annexing district as constituted after the annexation, while employed in an annexed or annexing district during the year immediately preceding the annexation, and the sum of the salaries those certificated members would have been paid during the immediately preceding year if placed on the salary schedule of whichever of the annexing or annexed districts had the highest salary schedule during the immediately preceding year.
    (3) For each new high school district formed under a school district conversion, as defined in Section 11E-15 of this Code, the State shall make a supplementary payment for 4 years equal to the difference between the sum of the salaries earned by each certified member of the new high school district, while employed in one of the previously existing districts, and the sum of the salaries those certified members would have been paid if placed on the salary schedule of the previously existing district with the highest salary schedule.
    (4) For each newly created partial elementary unit district, the State shall make a supplementary payment for 4 years equal to the difference between the sum of the salaries earned by each certified member of the newly created partial elementary unit district, while employed in one of the previously existing districts that formed the partial elementary unit district, and the sum of the salaries those certified members would have been paid if placed on the salary schedule of the previously existing district with the highest salary schedule. The salary schedules used in the calculation shall be those in effect in the previously existing districts for the school year prior to the creation of the new partial elementary unit district.
    (5) For an elementary district opt-in, as described in subsection (d) of Section 11E-30 of this Code, the salary difference incentive shall be computed in accordance with paragraph (4) of this subsection (b) as if the opted-in elementary district was included in the optional elementary unit district at the optional elementary unit district's original effective date. If the calculation in this paragraph (5) is less than that calculated in paragraph (4) of this subsection (b) at the optional elementary unit district's original effective date, then no adjustments may be made. If the calculation in this paragraph (5) is more than that calculated in paragraph (4) of this subsection (b) at the optional elementary unit district's original effective date, then the excess must be paid as follows:
        (A) If the effective date for the elementary opt-in
    	
is one year after the effective date for the optional elementary unit district, 100% of the calculated excess shall be paid to the optional elementary unit district in each of the first 4 years after the effective date of the elementary opt-in.
        (B) If the effective date for the elementary opt-in
    	
is 2 years after the effective date for the optional elementary unit district, 75% of the calculated excess shall be paid to the optional elementary unit district in each of the first 4 years after the effective date of the elementary opt-in.
        (C) If the effective date for the elementary opt-in
    	
is 3 years after the effective date for the optional elementary unit district, 50% of the calculated excess shall be paid to the optional elementary unit district in each of the first 4 years after the effective date of the elementary opt-in.
        (D) If the effective date for the elementary opt-in
    	
is 4 years after the effective date for the partial elementary unit district, 25% of the calculated excess shall be paid to the optional elementary unit district in each of the first 4 years after the effective date of the elementary opt-in.
        (E) If the effective date for the elementary opt-in
    	
is 5 years after the effective date for the optional elementary unit district, the optional elementary unit district is not eligible for any additional incentives due to the elementary opt-in.
    (5.5) After the formation of a cooperative high school by 2 or more school districts under Section 10-22.22c of this Code, a computation shall be made to determine the difference between the salaries effective in each of the previously existing high schools on June 30 prior to the formation of the cooperative high school. For the first 4 years after the formation of the cooperative high school, a supplementary State aid reimbursement shall be paid to the cooperative high school equal to the difference between the sum of the salaries earned by each of the certificated members of the cooperative high school while employed in one of the previously existing high schools during the year immediately preceding the formation of the cooperative high school and the sum of the salaries those certificated members would have been paid during the year immediately prior to the formation of the cooperative high school if placed on the salary schedule of the previously existing high school with the highest salary schedule.
    (5.10) After the annexation of territory detached from another school district whereby the enrollment of the annexing district increases by 90% or more as a result of the annexation, a computation shall be made to determine the difference between the salaries effective in the district gaining territory and the district losing territory as they each were constituted on June 30 preceding the date when the change of boundaries attributable to the annexation became effective for all purposes as determined under Section 7-9 of this Code. For the first 4 years after the annexation, a supplementary State aid reimbursement shall be paid to the annexing district equal to the difference between the sum of the salaries earned by each of the certificated members of the annexing district as constituted after the annexation while employed in the district gaining territory or the district losing territory during the year immediately preceding the annexation and the sum of the salaries those certificated members would have been paid during such immediately preceding year if placed on the salary schedule of whichever of the district gaining territory or district losing territory had the highest salary schedule during the immediately preceding year. To be eligible for supplementary State aid reimbursement under this Section, the intergovernmental agreement to be submitted pursuant to Section 7-14A of this Code must show that staff members were transferred from the control of the district losing territory to the control of the district gaining territory in the annexation. The changes to this Section made by Public Act 95-707 are intended to be retroactive and applicable to any annexation taking effect on or after July 1, 2004. For annexations that are eligible for payments under this paragraph (5.10) and that are effective on or after July 1, 2004, but before January 11, 2008 (the effective date of Public Act 95-707), the first required yearly payment under this paragraph (5.10) shall be paid in the fiscal year of January 11, 2008 (the effective date of Public Act 95-707). Subsequent required yearly payments shall be paid in subsequent fiscal years until the payment obligation under this paragraph (5.10) is complete.
    (5.15) After the deactivation of a school facility in accordance with Section 10-22.22b of this Code, a computation shall be made to determine the difference between the salaries effective in the sending school district and each receiving school district on June 30 prior to the deactivation of the school facility. For the lesser of the first 4 years after the deactivation of the school facility or the length of the deactivation agreement, including any renewals of the original deactivation agreement, a supplementary State aid reimbursement shall be paid to each receiving district equal to the difference between the sum of the salaries earned by each of the certificated members transferred to that receiving district as a result of the deactivation while employed in the sending district during the year immediately preceding the deactivation and the sum of the salaries those certificated members would have been paid during the year immediately preceding the deactivation if placed on the salary schedule of the sending or receiving district with the highest salary schedule.
    (6) The supplementary State aid reimbursement under this subsection (b) shall be treated as separate from all other payments made pursuant to Section 18-8.05 of this Code. In the case of the formation of a new district or cooperative high school or a deactivation, reimbursement shall begin during the first year of operation of the new district or cooperative high school or the first year of the deactivation, and in the case of an annexation of the territory of one or more school districts by one or more other school districts or the annexation of territory detached from a school district whereby the enrollment of the annexing district increases by 90% or more as a result of the annexation, reimbursement shall begin during the first year when the change in boundaries attributable to the annexation becomes effective for all purposes as determined pursuant to Section 7-9 of this Code, except that for an annexation of territory detached from a school district that is effective on or after July 1, 2004, but before January 11, 2008 (the effective date of Public Act 95-707), whereby the enrollment of the annexing district increases by 90% or more as a result of the annexation, reimbursement shall begin during the fiscal year of January 11, 2008 (the effective date of Public Act 95-707). Each year that the new, annexing, or receiving district or cooperative high school, as the case may be, is entitled to receive reimbursement, the number of eligible certified members who are employed on October 1 in the district or cooperative high school shall be certified to the State Board of Education on prescribed forms by October 15 and payment shall be made on or before November 15 of that year.
    (c)(1) For the first year after the formation of a combined school district, as defined in Section 11E-20 of this Code or a unit district, as defined in Section 11E-25 of this Code, a computation shall be made totaling each previously existing district's audited fund balances in the educational fund, working cash fund, operations and maintenance fund, and transportation fund for the year ending June 30 prior to the referendum for the creation of the new district. The new district shall be paid supplementary State aid equal to the sum of the differences between the deficit of the previously existing district with the smallest deficit and the deficits of each of the other previously existing districts.
    (2) For the first year after the annexation of all of the territory of one or more entire school districts by another school district, as defined in Article 7 of this Code, computations shall be made, for the year ending June 30 prior to the date that the change of boundaries attributable to the annexation is allowed by the affirmative decision issued by the regional board of school trustees under Section 7-6 of this Code, notwithstanding any effort to seek administrative review of the decision, totaling the annexing district's and totaling each annexed district's audited fund balances in their respective educational, working cash, operations and maintenance, and transportation funds. The annexing district as constituted after the annexation shall be paid supplementary State aid equal to the sum of the differences between the deficit of whichever of the annexing or annexed districts as constituted prior to the annexation had the smallest deficit and the deficits of each of the other districts as constituted prior to the annexation.
    (3) For the first year after the annexation of all of the territory of one or more entire school districts by 2 or more other school districts, as defined by Article 7 of this Code, computations shall be made, for the year ending June 30 prior to the date that the change of boundaries attributable to the annexation is allowed by the affirmative decision of the regional board of school trustees under Section 7-6 of this Code, notwithstanding any action for administrative review of the decision, totaling each annexing and annexed district's audited fund balances in their respective educational, working cash, operations and maintenance, and transportation funds. The annexing districts as constituted after the annexation shall be paid supplementary State aid, allocated as provided in this paragraph (3), in an aggregate amount equal to the sum of the differences between the deficit of whichever of the annexing or annexed districts as constituted prior to the annexation had the smallest deficit and the deficits of each of the other districts as constituted prior to the annexation. The aggregate amount of the supplementary State aid payable under this paragraph (3) shall be allocated between or among the annexing districts as follows:
        (A) the regional superintendent of schools for each
    	
educational service region in which an annexed district is located prior to the annexation shall certify to the State Board of Education, on forms that it shall provide for that purpose, the value of all taxable property in each annexed district, as last equalized or assessed by the Department of Revenue prior to the annexation, and the equalized assessed value of each part of the annexed district that was annexed to or included as a part of an annexing district;
        (B) using equalized assessed values as certified by
    	
the regional superintendent of schools under clause (A) of this paragraph (3), the combined audited fund balance deficit of each annexed district as determined under this Section shall be apportioned between or among the annexing districts in the same ratio as the equalized assessed value of that part of the annexed district that was annexed to or included as a part of an annexing district bears to the total equalized assessed value of the annexed district; and
        (C) the aggregate supplementary State aid payment
    	
under this paragraph (3) shall be allocated between or among, and shall be paid to, the annexing districts in the same ratio as the sum of the combined audited fund balance deficit of each annexing district as constituted prior to the annexation, plus all combined audited fund balance deficit amounts apportioned to that annexing district under clause (B) of this subsection, bears to the aggregate of the combined audited fund balance deficits of all of the annexing and annexed districts as constituted prior to the annexation.
    (4) For the new elementary districts and new high school district formed through a school district conversion, as defined in Section 11E-15 of this Code or the new elementary district or districts and new combined high school - unit district formed through a multi-unit conversion, as defined in subsection (b) of Section 11E-30 of this Code, a computation shall be made totaling each previously existing district's audited fund balances in the educational fund, working cash fund, operations and maintenance fund, and transportation fund for the year ending June 30 prior to the referendum establishing the new districts. In the first year of the new districts, the State shall make a one-time supplementary payment equal to the sum of the differences between the deficit of the previously existing district with the smallest deficit and the deficits of each of the other previously existing districts. A district with a combined balance among the 4 funds that is positive shall be considered to have a deficit of zero. The supplementary payment shall be allocated among the newly formed high school and elementary districts in the manner provided by the petition for the formation of the districts, in the form in which the petition is approved by the regional superintendent of schools or State Superintendent of Education under Section 11E-50 of this Code.
    (5) For each newly created partial elementary unit district, as defined in subsection (a) or (c) of Section 11E-30 of this Code, a computation shall be made totaling the audited fund balances of each previously existing district that formed the new partial elementary unit district in the educational fund, working cash fund, operations and maintenance fund, and transportation fund for the year ending June 30 prior to the referendum for the formation of the partial elementary unit district. In the first year of the new partial elementary unit district, the State shall make a one-time supplementary payment to the new district equal to the sum of the differences between the deficit of the previously existing district with the smallest deficit and the deficits of each of the other previously existing districts. A district with a combined balance among the 4 funds that is positive shall be considered to have a deficit of zero.
    (6) For an elementary opt-in as defined in subsection (d) of Section 11E-30 of this Code, the deficit fund balance incentive shall be computed in accordance with paragraph (5) of this subsection (c) as if the opted-in elementary was included in the optional elementary unit district at the optional elementary unit district's original effective date. If the calculation in this paragraph (6) is less than that calculated in paragraph (5) of this subsection (c) at the optional elementary unit district's original effective date, then no adjustments may be made. If the calculation in this paragraph (6) is more than that calculated in paragraph (5) of this subsection (c) at the optional elementary unit district's original effective date, then the excess must be paid as follows:
        (A) If the effective date for the elementary opt-in
    	
is one year after the effective date for the optional elementary unit district, 100% of the calculated excess shall be paid to the optional elementary unit district in the first year after the effective date of the elementary opt-in.
        (B) If the effective date for the elementary opt-in
    	
is 2 years after the effective date for the optional elementary unit district, 75% of the calculated excess shall be paid to the optional elementary unit district in the first year after the effective date of the elementary opt-in.
        (C) If the effective date for the elementary opt-in
    	
is 3 years after the effective date for the optional elementary unit district, 50% of the calculated excess shall be paid to the optional elementary unit district in the first year after the effective date of the elementary opt-in.
        (D) If the effective date for the elementary opt-in
    	
is 4 years after the effective date for the optional elementary unit district, 25% of the calculated excess shall be paid to the optional elementary unit district in the first year after the effective date of the elementary opt-in.
        (E) If the effective date for the elementary opt-in
    	
is 5 years after the effective date for the optional elementary unit district, the optional elementary unit district is not eligible for any additional incentives due to the elementary opt-in.
    (6.5) For the first year after the annexation of territory detached from another school district whereby the enrollment of the annexing district increases by 90% or more as a result of the annexation, a computation shall be made totaling the audited fund balances of the district gaining territory and the audited fund balances of the district losing territory in the educational fund, working cash fund, operations and maintenance fund, and transportation fund for the year ending June 30 prior to the date that the change of boundaries attributable to the annexation is allowed by the affirmative decision of the regional board of school trustees under Section 7-6 of this Code, notwithstanding any action for administrative review of the decision. The annexing district as constituted after the annexation shall be paid supplementary State aid equal to the difference between the deficit of whichever district included in this calculation as constituted prior to the annexation had the smallest deficit and the deficit of each other district included in this calculation as constituted prior to the annexation, multiplied by the ratio of equalized assessed value of the territory detached to the total equalized assessed value of the district losing territory. The regional superintendent of schools for the educational service region in which a district losing territory is located prior to the annexation shall certify to the State Board of Education the value of all taxable property in the district losing territory and the value of all taxable property in the territory being detached, as last equalized or assessed by the Department of Revenue prior to the annexation. To be eligible for supplementary State aid reimbursement under this Section, the intergovernmental agreement to be submitted pursuant to Section 7-14A of this Code must show that fund balances were transferred from the district losing territory to the district gaining territory in the annexation. The changes to this Section made by Public Act 95-707 are intended to be retroactive and applicable to any annexation taking effect on or after July 1, 2004. For annexations that are eligible for payments under this paragraph (6.5) and that are effective on or after July 1, 2004, but before January 11, 2008 (the effective date of Public Act 95-707), the required payment under this paragraph (6.5) shall be paid in the fiscal year of January 11, 2008 (the effective date of Public Act 95-707).
    (7) For purposes of any calculation required under paragraph (1), (2), (3), (4), (5), (6), or (6.5) of this subsection (c), a district with a combined fund balance that is positive shall be considered to have a deficit of zero. For purposes of determining each district's audited fund balances in its educational fund, working cash fund, operations and maintenance fund, and transportation fund for the specified year ending June 30, as provided in paragraphs (1), (2), (3), (4), (5), (6), and (6.5) of this subsection (c), the balance of each fund shall be deemed decreased by an amount equal to the amount of the annual property tax theretofore levied in the fund by the district for collection and payment to the district during the calendar year in which the June 30 fell, but only to the extent that the tax so levied in the fund actually was received by the district on or before or comprised a part of the fund on such June 30. For purposes of determining each district's audited fund balances, a calculation shall be made for each fund to determine the average for the 3 years prior to the specified year ending June 30, as provided in paragraphs (1), (2), (3), (4), (5), (6), and (6.5) of this subsection (c), of the district's expenditures in the categories "purchased services", "supplies and materials", and "capital outlay", as those categories are defined in rules of the State Board of Education. If this 3-year average is less than the district's expenditures in these categories for the specified year ending June 30, as provided in paragraphs (1), (2), (3), (4), (5), (6), and (6.5) of this subsection (c), then the 3-year average shall be used in calculating the amounts payable under this Section in place of the amounts shown in these categories for the specified year ending June 30, as provided in paragraphs (1), (2), (3), (4), (5), (6), and (6.5) of this subsection (c). Any deficit because of State aid not yet received may not be considered in determining the June 30 deficits. The same basis of accounting shall be used by all previously existing districts and by all annexing or annexed districts, as constituted prior to the annexation, in making any computation required under paragraphs (1), (2), (3), (4), (5), (6), and (6.5) of this subsection (c).
    (8) The supplementary State aid payments under this subsection (c) shall be treated as separate from all other payments made pursuant to Section 18-8.05 of this Code.
    (d)(1) Following the formation of a combined school district, as defined in Section 11E-20 of this Code, a new unit district, as defined in Section 11E-25 of this Code, a new elementary district or districts and a new high school district formed through a school district conversion, as defined in Section 11E-15 of this Code, a new partial elementary unit district, as defined in Section 11E-30 of this Code, or a new elementary district or districts formed through a multi-unit conversion, as defined in subsection (b) of Section 11E-30 of this Code, or the annexation of all of the territory of one or more entire school districts by one or more other school districts, as defined in Article 7 of this Code, a supplementary State aid reimbursement shall be paid for the number of school years determined under the following table to each new or annexing district equal to the sum of $4,000 for each certified employee who is employed by the district on a full-time basis for the regular term of the school year:
 
Reorganized District's Rank	Reorganized District's Rank
by type of district (unit,	in Average Daily Attendance
high school, elementary)	By Quintile
in Equalized Assessed Value			
Per Pupil by Quintile			

3rd, 4th,

1st	2nd	or 5th

Quintile	Quintile	Quintile
    1st Quintile	1 year	1 year	1 year
    2nd Quintile	1 year	2 years	2 years
    3rd Quintile	2 years	3 years	3 years
    4th Quintile	2 years	3 years	3 years
    5th Quintile	2 years	3 years	3 years

 
The State Board of Education shall make a one-time calculation of a reorganized district's quintile ranks. The average daily attendance used in this calculation shall be the best 3 months' average daily attendance for the district's first year. The equalized assessed value per pupil shall be the district's real property equalized assessed value used in calculating the district's first-year general State aid claim, under Section 18-8.05 of this Code, or first-year evidence-based funding claim, under Section 18-8.15 of this Code, as applicable, divided by the best 3 months' average daily attendance.
    No annexing or resulting school district shall be entitled to supplementary State aid under this subsection (d) unless the district acquires at least 30% of the average daily attendance of the district from which the territory is being detached or divided.
    If a district results from multiple reorganizations that would otherwise qualify the district for multiple payments under this subsection (d) in any year, then the district shall receive a single payment only for that year based solely on the most recent reorganization.
    (2) For an elementary opt-in, as defined in subsection (d) of Section 11E-30 of this Code, the full-time certified staff incentive shall be computed in accordance with paragraph (1) of this subsection (d), equal to the sum of $4,000 for each certified employee of the elementary district that opts-in who is employed by the optional elementary unit district on a full-time basis for the regular term of the school year. The calculation from this paragraph (2) must be paid as follows:
        (A) If the effective date for the elementary opt-in
    	
is one year after the effective date for the optional elementary unit district, 100% of the amount calculated in this paragraph (2) shall be paid to the optional elementary unit district for the number of years calculated in paragraph (1) of this subsection (d) at the optional elementary unit district's original effective date, starting in the second year after the effective date of the elementary opt-in.
        (B) If the effective date for the elementary opt-in
    	
is 2 years after the effective date for the optional elementary unit district, 75% of the amount calculated in this paragraph (2) shall be paid to the optional elementary unit district for the number of years calculated in paragraph (1) of this subsection (d) at the optional elementary unit district's original effective date, starting in the second year after the effective date of the elementary opt-in.
        (C) If the effective date for the elementary opt-in
    	
is 3 years after the effective date for the optional elementary unit district, 50% of the amount calculated in this paragraph (2) shall be paid to the optional elementary unit district for the number of years calculated in paragraph (1) of this subsection (d) at the optional elementary unit district's original effective date, starting in the second year after the effective date of the elementary opt-in.
        (D) If the effective date for the elementary opt-in
    	
is 4 years after the effective date for the optional elementary unit district, 25% of the amount calculated in this paragraph (2) shall be paid to the optional elementary unit district for the number of years calculated in paragraph (1) of this subsection (d) at the optional elementary unit district's original effective date, starting in the second year after the effective date of the elementary opt-in.
        (E) If the effective date for the elementary opt-in
    	
is 5 years after the effective date for the optional elementary unit district, the optional elementary unit district is not eligible for any additional incentives due to the elementary opt-in.
    (2.5) Following the formation of a cooperative high school by 2 or more school districts under Section 10-22.22c of this Code, a supplementary State aid reimbursement shall be paid for 3 school years to the cooperative high school equal to the sum of $4,000 for each certified employee who is employed by the cooperative high school on a full-time basis for the regular term of any such school year. If a cooperative high school results from multiple agreements that would otherwise qualify the cooperative high school for multiple payments under this Section in any year, the cooperative high school shall receive a single payment for that year based solely on the most recent agreement.
    (2.10) Following the annexation of territory detached from another school district whereby the enrollment of the annexing district increases 90% or more as a result of the annexation, a supplementary State aid reimbursement shall be paid to the annexing district equal to the sum of $4,000 for each certified employee who is employed by the annexing district on a full-time basis and shall be calculated in accordance with subsection (a) of this Section. To be eligible for supplementary State aid reimbursement under this Section, the intergovernmental agreement to be submitted pursuant to Section 7-14A of this Code must show that certified staff members were transferred from the control of the district losing territory to the control of the district gaining territory in the annexation. The changes to this Section made by Public Act 95-707 are intended to be retroactive and applicable to any annexation taking effect on or after July 1, 2004. For annexations that are eligible for payments under this paragraph (2.10) and that are effective on or after July 1, 2004, but before January 11, 2008 (the effective date of Public Act 95-707), the first required yearly payment under this paragraph (2.10) shall be paid in the second fiscal year after January 11, 2008 (the effective date of Public Act 95-707). Any subsequent required yearly payments shall be paid in subsequent fiscal years until the payment obligation under this paragraph (2.10) is complete.
    (2.15) Following the deactivation of a school facility in accordance with Section 10-22.22b of this Code, a supplementary State aid reimbursement shall be paid for the lesser of 3 school years or the length of the deactivation agreement, including any renewals of the original deactivation agreement, to each receiving school district equal to the sum of $4,000 for each certified employee who is employed by that receiving district on a full-time basis for the regular term of any such school year who was originally transferred to the control of that receiving district as a result of the deactivation. Receiving districts are eligible for payments under this paragraph (2.15) based on the certified employees transferred to that receiving district as a result of the deactivation and are not required to receive at least 30% of the deactivating district's average daily attendance as required under paragraph (1) of this subsection (d) to be eligible for payments.
    (3) The supplementary State aid reimbursement payable under this subsection (d) shall be separate from and in addition to all other payments made to the district pursuant to any other Section of this Article.
    (4) During May of each school year for which a supplementary State aid reimbursement is to be paid to a new, annexing, or receiving school district or cooperative high school pursuant to this subsection (d), the school board or governing board shall certify to the State Board of Education, on forms furnished to the school board or governing board by the State Board of Education for purposes of this subsection (d), the number of certified employees for which the district or cooperative high school is entitled to reimbursement under this Section, together with the names, certificate numbers, and positions held by the certified employees.
    (5) Upon certification by the State Board of Education to the State Comptroller of the amount of the supplementary State aid reimbursement to which a school district or cooperative high school is entitled under this subsection (d), the State Comptroller shall draw his or her warrant upon the State Treasurer for the payment thereof to the school district or cooperative high school and shall promptly transmit the payment to the school district or cooperative high school through the appropriate school treasurer.

If there has been a delay in the extension and collection of taxes levied by the governing body of any nonhigh school district caused by a reassessment of real property therein, the district may issue bonds for the purpose of paying unpaid tuition claims or other claims against it.
    Before any nonhigh school district issues any such bonds the board of education shall examine and consider the claims proposed to be paid, and if it appears that they were authorized and allowed for proper nonhigh school purposes, it shall adopt a resolution so declaring and set forth and describe in detail such claims. The adoption of the resolution shall establish the validity thereof. The resolution shall also declare the intention of the nonhigh school district to issue bonds for the purpose of paying such claims and direct that notice of such intention be published at least once in a newspaper published and having a general circulation in the district, if there be one, but if there is no newspaper published in such district then by publishing such notice in a newspaper having a general circulation in the district or if no newspaper is published in the district in one or more newspapers with a general circulation in the district. The notice shall include a statement of (1) the specific number of voters required to sign a petition requesting that the question of the adoption of the resolution be submitted to the electors of the district; (2) the time in which the petition must be filed; and (3) the date of the prospective referendum. The recording officer of the district shall provide a petition form to any individual requesting one. If within 30 days after the publication a petition is filed with the recording officer of the district, signed by voters of the district equal to 10% or more of the registered voters of the district, requesting that the proposition to issue the bonds be submitted to the voters thereof, then such district shall not be authorized to issue them until either the petition has been determined to be invalid or insufficient or the proposition has been submitted to and approved by a majority of the voters voting on the proposition at a regular scheduled election. The board shall certify the proposition to the proper election authorities for submission in accordance with the general election law. If no such petition is filed, or if any and all petitions filed are invalid, such district may issue the bonds. In addition to the requirements of the general election law the notice of the election shall set forth the intention of the district to issue bonds under the provisions of this Section. The ballot to be used at the election shall be in substantially the following form:

    (105 ILCS 5/13-40) (from Ch. 122, par. 13-40)
    Sec. 13-40. To increase the effectiveness of the Department of Juvenile Justice and thereby to better serve the interests of the people of Illinois the following bill is presented.
    Its purpose is to enhance the quality and scope of education for inmates and wards within the Department of Juvenile Justice so that they will be better motivated and better equipped to restore themselves to constructive and law abiding lives in the community. The specific measure sought is the creation of a school district within the Department so that its educational programs can meet the needs of persons committed and so the resources of public education at the state and federal levels are best used, all of the same being contemplated within the provisions of the Illinois State Constitution of 1970 which provides that "A fundamental goal of the People of the State is the educational development of all persons to the limits of their capacities." Therefore, on July 1, 2006, the Department of Corrections school district shall be transferred to the Department of Juvenile Justice. It shall be responsible for the education of youth within the Department of Juvenile Justice and inmates age 21 or under within the Department of Corrections who have not yet earned a high school diploma or a high school equivalency certificate, and the district may establish primary, secondary, vocational, adult, special, and advanced educational schools as provided in this Act.

ARTICLE 13A. ALTERNATIVE PUBLIC SCHOOLS

    (105 ILCS 5/13A-0.5)
    Sec. 13A-0.5. This Article may be cited as the Safe Schools Law.
(Source: P.A. 89-383, eff. 8-18-95.)

    (105 ILCS 5/13A-1)
    Sec. 13A-1. Legislative Declaration. The General Assembly finds and declares as follows:
    (a) The children of this State constitute its most important resource, and in order to enable those children to reach their full potential, the State must provide them the quality public education that the Constitution of the State of Illinois mandates.
    (b) The State cannot provide its children with the education they deserve and require unless the environment of the public schools is conducive to learning.
    (c) That environment cannot be achieved unless an atmosphere of safety prevails, assuring that the person of each student, teacher, and staff member is respected, and that none of those people are subjected to violence, threats, harassment, intimidation, or otherwise confrontational or inappropriate behaviors that disrupt the educational atmosphere.
    (d) In most schools, although the disruptive students who are the primary cause of inappropriate educational environments comprise a small percentage of the total student body, they nevertheless consume a substantial amount of the time and resources of teachers and school administrators who are required to address and contain that disruptive behavior.
    (e) Disruptive students typically derive little benefit from traditional school programs and may benefit substantially by being transferred from their current school into an alternative public school program, where their particular needs may be more appropriately and individually addressed and where they may benefit from the opportunity for a fresh start in a new educational environment. At those alternative school programs, innovative academic and school-to-work programs, including but not limited to the techniques of work based learning and technology delivered learning, can be utilized to best help the students enrolled in those schools to become productive citizens.
    (f) Students need an appropriate, constructive classroom atmosphere in order to benefit from the teacher's presentations. Students cannot afford the classroom disruptions and often become frustrated and angry at the inability of their teachers and schools to control disruptive students. As a result, they drop out of school too often. Furthermore, even if these students stay in school and graduate, they have been deprived by their disruptive classmates of the attention to their educational needs that their teachers would otherwise have provided, thereby diminishing their receiving the education and skills necessary to secure good jobs and become productive members of an increasingly competitive economic environment.
    (g) Parents of school children statewide have expressed their rising anger and concern at the failure of their local public schools to provide a safe and appropriate educational environment for their children and to deal appropriately with disruptive students, and the General Assembly deems their concerns to be understandable and justified.
    (h) Every school district in the State shall do all it can to ensure a safe and appropriate educational environment for all of its students, and the first, but not the only, step school districts must take to achieve that goal is to administratively transfer disruptive students from the schools they currently attend to the alternative school programs created by this Article. Those administrative transfers will also provide optional educational programs to best fit the needs of the transferred students.
    (i) Administrative transfers may prove more productive for dealing with disruptive students than out-of-school suspensions or expulsions, which have been the subject of much criticism.
    (j) Because of the urgency of the problems described in this Section, as well as their statewide impact, the State of Illinois bears the responsibility to establish and fully fund alternative schools as soon as possible, thereby providing school districts with an option for dealing with disruptive students that they do not now possess.
    (k) While school districts shall comply with all applicable federal laws and regulations, they should do so consistent with the goals and policies stated in this Article. Further, this Article is intended to be consistent with all applicable federal laws and regulations.
    (l) An alternative school program established under this Article is subject to the other provisions of this Code that apply generally in the public schools of this State and to the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, except as otherwise provided in this Article.
    (m) The provisions of the Illinois Educational Labor Relations Act apply to those alternative school programs that are created on or after the effective date of this amendatory Act of 1995.

    Sec. 13A-3. Alternative schools.
    (a) Except with respect to the Chicago public school system as provided in Section 13A-11, beginning with the 1996-97 school year, there is hereby created in this State a system of alternative school education programs. At least one alternative school program may be located within each educational service region or established jointly by more than one regional office of education to serve more than one educational service region.
    (b) Each regional superintendent shall hold a public hearing, by December 1 of the school year following the effective date of this amendatory Act of 1995, to determine the need for an alternative school. The hearing shall be held before the regional board. The regional superintendent, after consulting with the district superintendent of each school district located within the regional superintendent's educational service region and the regional board, shall determine the location and the need of the alternative school within that region. In making this determination, the regional superintendent shall consider the following:
        (1) the possible utilization of existing buildings,
    	
including but not limited to governmental buildings, that are, or could reasonably be made, usable as an alternative school;
        (2) which available option would be least costly; and
        (3) distances that administratively transferred
    	
students would need to travel and the costs of that travel.
    (c) Upon determination of the need for establishment of an alternative school program, each school district located within the region shall provide the regional superintendent with a copy of the district's discipline policy and procedure for effecting the suspension or expulsion of the students of that district.

    Sec. 13A-8. Funding.
    (a) The State of Illinois shall provide funding for the alternative school programs within each educational service region and within the Chicago public school system by line item appropriation made to the State Board of Education for that purpose. This money, when appropriated, shall be provided to the regional superintendent and to the Chicago Board of Education, who shall establish a budget, including salaries, for their alternative school programs. Each program shall receive funding in the amount of $30,000 plus an amount based on the ratio of the region's or Chicago's best 3 months' average daily attendance in grades pre-kindergarten through 12 to the statewide totals of these amounts. For purposes of this calculation, the best 3 months' average daily attendance for each region or Chicago shall be calculated by adding to the best 3 months' average daily attendance the number of low-income students identified in the most recently available federal census multiplied by one-half times the percentage of the region's or Chicago's low-income students to the State's total low-income students. The State Board of Education shall retain up to 1.1% of the appropriation to be used to provide technical assistance, professional development, and evaluations for the programs.
    (a-5) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Section, for the 1998-1999 fiscal year, the total amount distributed under subsection (a) for an alternative school program shall be not less than the total amount that was distributed under that subsection for that alternative school program for the 1997-1998 fiscal year. If an alternative school program is to receive a total distribution under subsection (a) for the 1998-1999 fiscal year that is less than the total distribution that the program received under that subsection for the 1997-1998 fiscal year, that alternative school program shall also receive, from a separate appropriation made for purposes of this subsection (a-5), a supplementary payment equal to the amount by which its total distribution under subsection (a) for the 1997-1998 fiscal year exceeds the amount of the total distribution that the alternative school program receives under that subsection for the 1998-1999 fiscal year. If the amount appropriated for supplementary payments to alternative school programs under this subsection (a-5) is insufficient for that purpose, those supplementary payments shall be prorated among the alternative school programs entitled to receive those supplementary payments according to the aggregate amount of the appropriation made for purposes of this subsection (a-5).
    (b) An alternative school program shall be entitled to receive general State aid as calculated in subsection (K) of Section 18-8.05 or evidence-based funding as calculated in subsection (g) of Section 18-8.15 upon filing a claim as provided therein. Any time that a student who is enrolled in an alternative school program spends in work-based learning, community service, or a similar alternative educational setting shall be included in determining the student's minimum number of clock hours of daily school work that constitute a day of attendance for purposes of calculating general State aid or evidence-based funding.
    (c) An alternative school program may receive additional funding from its school districts in such amount as may be agreed upon by the parties and necessary to support the program. In addition, an alternative school program is authorized to accept and expend gifts, legacies, and grants, including but not limited to federal grants, from any source for purposes directly related to the conduct and operation of the program.

The State Board of Education shall seek the advice of the Advisory Council on modifications or additions to comprehensive plans submitted under Section 14-4.01.

    The Council shall be composed of 27 members, including 23 voting members appointed by the Governor and 4 ex-officio voting members. Members shall be broadly representative of the State's population in regard to developmental, physical, and mental disabilities, race, ethnic background, gender, and geographic location. Nine members shall be parents of children with disabilities between the ages of 3 and 21 years currently receiving special education services at public expense.

Within 30 days after the effective date of this amendatory Act of 1998, the Governor or his designee shall invite statewide organizations, being as inclusive as possible and based upon a reasonable inquiry, and Parent Training and Information Centers representing parents of children with disabilities, individuals with disabilities or both, to convene for the purpose of recommending to the Governor twice the number of individuals required to be appointed as members from each of the categories described in this paragraph, from which the Governor may appoint the 14 members of the Council who are parents of children with disabilities and individuals with disabilities. The 9 members who are parents of children with disabilities between the ages of 3 and 21 years receiving special education services at public expense and the 5 members who are individuals with disabilities shall not be current full or part-time employees of school districts, special education cooperatives, regional service areas or centers, or any agency under the jurisdiction of any elected State official.

    All Council members shall be legal residents of the State of Illinois and shall be selected, as far as practicable, on the basis of their knowledge of, or experience in, the education of children with disabilities.
    The initial members to be appointed to the Council by the Governor under the provisions of this amendatory Act of 1998 shall be appointed within 60 days after the effective date of that amendatory Act; provided that those persons who are serving as Council members on that effective date and who, as determined by the Governor after consultation with the State Board of Education, meet the requirements established by this amendatory Act for appointment to membership on the Council shall continue to serve as Council members until the completion of the remainder of their current terms. The initial members of the Council who are not Council members on the effective date of this amendatory Act of 1998 and who are appointed by the Governor under this amendatory Act of 1998 shall by lot determine one-third of their number to serve for a term of 2 years (provided that person appointed as the student or former student member shall be included among those members who are to serve a term of 2 years), one-third of their number to serve for a term of 3 years, and one-third of their number to serve for a term of 4 years; provided, that if the total number of initial members so appointed by the Governor is not divisible into 3 whole numbers, all of the initial members so appointed shall by lot be assigned to 3 groups as follows: (i) the members assigned to the first group, who shall include the student or former student member and who shall be equal in number to the number of members who are assigned to the second group, shall serve for a term of 2 years; (ii) the members assigned to the second group, who shall be equal in number to the number of members who are assigned to the first group, shall serve for a term of 3 years; and (iii) the members assigned to the third group, who shall comprise the remainder of the initial members so appointed by the Governor and whose number shall be either one more or one less than the number of members assigned to either the first group or second group, shall serve for a term of 4 years. Upon expiration of the term of office of a member of the Council who is not an ex-officio member, his or her successor shall be appointed by the Governor to serve for a term of 4 years, except that a successor appointed as the student or former student member shall be appointed to serve for a term of 2 years. Each member of the Council who is not an ex-officio member and whose term of office expires shall nevertheless continue to serve as a Council member until his or her successor is appointed. Each of the 4 ex-officio members of the Council shall continue to serve as a Council member during the period in which he or she continues to hold the office by reason of which he or she became an ex-officio member of the Council. The initial members of the Council who are not ex-officio members shall not, upon completion of their respective initial terms, be appointed to serve more than one additional consecutive term of 4 years, nor shall any successor member of the Council be appointed to serve more than 2 full consecutive 4-year terms; provided, that a person appointed as the student or former student member shall serve only one two-year term and shall not be reappointed to serve for an additional term. Vacancies in Council memberships held by parents of children with disabilities or individuals with disabilities may be filled from the original list of such parents and individuals recommended to the Governor. The Governor shall reconvene the group of organizations that provided the original list of parents of children with disabilities and individuals with disabilities when additional recommendations for those Council memberships are needed, but at a minimum the group shall be convened every 2 years for the purpose of updating the list of recommended parents or individuals. A vacancy in an appointed membership on the Council shall be filled for the unexpired balance of the term of that membership in the same manner that the original appointment for that membership was made.
    The terms of all persons serving as Advisory Council members on the effective date of this amendatory Act of 1998 who are not determined by the Governor, after consultation with the State Board of Education, to meet the requirements established by this amendatory Act for appointment to initial membership on the Council shall terminate on the date that the Governor completes his appointments of the initial members of the Council under this amendatory Act, and the members of the Council as constituted under this amendatory Act shall take office and assume their powers and duties on that date.
    The Council as constituted under this amendatory Act of 1998 shall organize with a chairperson selected by the Council members and shall meet at the call of the chairperson upon 10 days written notice but not less than 4 times a year. The Council shall establish such committees and procedures as it deems appropriate to carry out its responsibilities under this Act and the federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act.
    The State Board of Education shall designate an employee to act as executive secretary of the Council and shall furnish all professional and clerical assistance necessary for the performance of its duties.
    Members of the Council shall serve without compensation but shall be reimbursed for the necessary expenses incurred in the performance of their duties in accordance with the State Board of Education's Travel Control Policy.

    Sec. 14-6.01. Powers and duties of school boards. School boards of one or more school districts establishing and maintaining any of the educational facilities described in this Article shall, in connection therewith, exercise similar powers and duties as are prescribed by law for the establishment, maintenance, and management of other recognized educational facilities. Such school boards shall include only eligible children in the program and shall comply with all the requirements of this Article and all rules and regulations established by the State Board of Education. Such school boards shall accept in part-time attendance children with disabilities of the types described in Sections 14-1.02 through 14-1.07 who are enrolled in nonpublic schools. A request for part-time attendance must be submitted by a parent or guardian of the child with a disability and may be made only to those public schools located in the district where the child attending the nonpublic school resides; however, nothing in this Section shall be construed as prohibiting an agreement between the district where the child resides and another public school district to provide special educational services if such an arrangement is deemed more convenient and economical. Special education and related services must be provided in accordance with the student's IEP no later than 10 school attendance days after notice is provided to the parents pursuant to Section 300.503 of Title 34 of the Code of Federal Regulations and implementing rules adopted by the State Board of Education. Transportation for students in part time attendance shall be provided only if required in the child's individualized educational program on the basis of the child's disabling condition or as the special education program location may require.
    Beginning with the 2019-2020 school year, a school board shall post on its Internet website, if any, and incorporate into its student handbook or newsletter notice that students with disabilities who do not qualify for an individualized education program, as required by the federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act and implementing provisions of this Code, may qualify for services under Section 504 of the federal Rehabilitation Act of 1973 if the child (i) has a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities, (ii) has a record of a physical or mental impairment, or (iii) is regarded as having a physical or mental impairment. Such notice shall identify the location and phone number of the office or agent of the school district to whom inquiries should be directed regarding the identification, assessment and placement of such children.
    For a school district organized under Article 34 only, beginning with the 2019-2020 school year, the school district shall, in collaboration with its primary office overseeing special education, publish on the school district's publicly available website any proposed changes to its special education policies, directives, guidelines, or procedures that impact the provision of educational or related services to students with disabilities or the procedural safeguards afforded to students with disabilities or their parents or guardians made by the school district or school board. Any policy, directive, guideline, or procedural change that impacts those provisions or safeguards that is authorized by the school district's primary office overseeing special education or any other administrative office of the school district must be published on the school district's publicly available website no later than 45 days before the adoption of that change. Any policy directive, guideline, or procedural change that impacts those provisions or safeguards that is authorized by the school board must be published on the school district's publicly available website no later than 30 days before the date of presentation to the school board for adoption. The school district's website must allow for virtual public comments on proposed special education policy, directive, guideline, or procedural changes that impact the provision of educational or related services to students with disabilities or the procedural safeguards afforded to students with disabilities or their parents or guardians from the date of the notification of the proposed change on the website until the date the change is adopted by the school district or until the date the change is presented to the school board for adoption. After the period for public comment is closed, the school district must maintain all public comments for a period of not less than 2 years from the date the special education change is adopted. The public comments are subject to the Freedom of Information Act. The school board shall, at a minimum, advertise the notice of the change and availability for public comment on its website. The State Board of Education may add additional reporting requirements for the district beyond policy, directive, guideline, or procedural changes that impact the provision of educational or related services to students with disabilities or the procedural safeguards afforded to students with disabilities or their parents or guardians if the State Board determines it is in the best interest of the students enrolled in the district receiving special education services.
    School boards shall immediately provide upon request by any person written materials and other information that indicates the specific policies, procedures, rules and regulations regarding the identification, evaluation or educational placement of children with disabilities under Section 14-8.02 of the School Code. Such information shall include information regarding all rights and entitlements of such children under this Code, and of the opportunity to present complaints with respect to any matter relating to educational placement of the student, or the provision of a free appropriate public education and to have an impartial due process hearing on the complaint. The notice shall inform the parents or guardian in the parents' or guardian's native language, unless it is clearly not feasible to do so, of their rights and all procedures available pursuant to this Act and federal Public Law 94-142; it shall be the responsibility of the State Superintendent to develop uniform notices setting forth the procedures available under this Act and federal Public Law 94-142, as amended, to be used by all school boards. The notice shall also inform the parents or guardian of the availability upon request of a list of free or low-cost legal and other relevant services available locally to assist parents or guardians in exercising rights or entitlements under this Code. For a school district organized under Article 34 only, the school district must make the entirety of its special education Procedural Manual and any other guidance documents pertaining to special education publicly available, in print and on the school district's website, in both English and Spanish. Upon request, the school district must make the Procedural Manual and other guidance documents available in print in any other language and accessible for individuals with disabilities.
    Any parent or guardian who is deaf, or does not normally communicate using spoken English, who participates in a meeting with a representative of a local educational agency for the purposes of developing an individualized educational program shall be entitled to the services of an interpreter.
    No student with a disability or, in a school district organized under Article 34 of this Code, child with a learning disability may be denied promotion, graduation or a general diploma on the basis of failing a minimal competency test when such failure can be directly related to the disabling condition of the student. For the purpose of this Act, "minimal competency testing" is defined as tests which are constructed to measure the acquisition of skills to or beyond a certain defined standard.
    Effective July 1, 1966, high school districts are financially responsible for the education of pupils with disabilities who are residents in their districts when such pupils have reached age 15 but may admit children with disabilities into special educational facilities without regard to graduation from the eighth grade after such pupils have reached the age of 14 1/2 years. Upon a pupil with a disability attaining the age of 14 1/2 years, it shall be the duty of the elementary school district in which the pupil resides to notify the high school district in which the pupil resides of the pupil's current eligibility for special education services, of the pupil's current program, and of all evaluation data upon which the current program is based. After an examination of that information the high school district may accept the current placement and all subsequent timelines shall be governed by the current individualized educational program; or the high school district may elect to conduct its own evaluation and multidisciplinary staff conference and formulate its own individualized educational program, in which case the procedures and timelines contained in Section 14-8.02 shall apply.

    Sec. 14-6.03. Speech-language pathology assistants.
    (a) Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, on or after January 1, 2002, no person shall perform the duties of a speech-language pathology assistant without first applying for and receiving a license for that purpose from the Department of Professional Regulation. A person employed as a speech-language pathology assistant in any class, service, or program authorized by this Article may perform only those duties authorized by this Section under the supervision of a speech-language pathologist as provided in this Section. This Section does not apply to speech-language pathology paraprofessionals approved by the State Board of Education.
    (b) A speech-language pathology assistant may not be assigned his or her own student caseload. The student caseload limit of a speech-language pathologist who supervises any speech-language pathology assistants shall be determined by the severity of the needs of the students served by the speech-language pathologist. A full-time speech-language pathologist's caseload limit may not exceed 80 students (60 students on or after September 1, 2003) at any time. The caseload limit of a part-time speech-language pathologist shall be determined by multiplying the caseload limit of a full-time speech-language pathologist by a percentage that equals the number of hours worked by the part-time speech-language pathologist divided by the number of hours worked by a full-time speech-language pathologist in that school district. Employment of a speech-language pathology assistant may not increase or decrease the caseload of the supervising speech-language pathologist.
    (c) A school district that intends to utilize the services of a speech-language pathology assistant must provide written notification to the parent or guardian of each student who will be served by a speech-language pathology assistant.
    (d) The scope of responsibility of a speech-language pathology assistant shall be limited to supplementing the role of the speech-language pathologist in implementing the treatment program established by a speech-language pathologist. The functions and duties of a speech-language pathology assistant shall be limited to the following:
        (1) Conducting speech-language screening, without
    	
interpretation, and using screening protocols selected by the supervising speech-language pathologist.
        (2) Providing direct treatment assistance to students
    	
under the supervision of a speech-language pathologist.
        (3) Following and implementing documented treatment
    	
plans or protocols developed by a supervising speech-language pathologist.
        (4) Documenting student progress toward meeting
    	
established objectives, and reporting the information to a supervising speech-language pathologist.
        (5) Assisting a speech-language pathologist during
    	
assessments, including, but not limited to, assisting with formal documentation, preparing materials, and performing clerical duties for a supervising speech-language pathologist.
        (6) Acting as an interpreter for non-English speaking
    	
students and their family members when competent to do so.
        (7) Scheduling activities and preparing charts,
    	
records, graphs, and data.
        (8) Performing checks and maintenance of equipment,
    	
including, but not limited to, augmentative communication devices.
        (9) Assisting with speech-language pathology research
    	
projects, in-service training, and family or community education.
    (e) A speech-language pathology assistant may not:
        (1) perform standardized or nonstandardized

conferences, or any interdisciplinary team without the presence of the supervising speech-language pathologist;
        (4) provide student or family counseling;
        (5) write, develop, or modify a student's
    	
individualized treatment plan;
        (6) assist with students without following the
    	
individualized treatment plan prepared by the supervising speech-language pathologist;
        (7) sign any formal documents, such as treatment
    	
plans, reimbursement forms, or reports;
        (8) select students for services;
        (9) discharge a student from services;
        (10) disclose clinical or confidential information,
    	
either orally or in writing, to anyone other than the supervising speech-language pathologist;
        (11) make referrals for additional services;
        (12) counsel or consult with the student, family, or
    	
others regarding the student's status or service;
        (13) represent himself or herself to be a
    	
speech-language pathologist or a speech therapist;
        (14) use a checklist or tabulate results of feeding
    	
or swallowing evaluations; or
        (15) demonstrate swallowing strategies or precautions
    	
to students, family, or staff.
    (f) A speech-language pathology assistant shall practice only under the supervision of a speech-language pathologist who has at least 2 years experience in addition to the supervised professional experience required under subsection (f) of Section 8 of the Illinois Speech-Language Pathology and Audiology Practice Act. A speech-language pathologist who supervises a speech-language pathology assistant must have completed at least 10 clock hours of training in the supervision of speech-language pathology assistants. The State Board of Education shall promulgate rules describing the supervision training requirements. The rules may allow a speech-language pathologist to apply to the State Board of Education for an exemption from this training requirement based upon prior supervisory experience.
    (g) A speech-language pathology assistant must be under the direct supervision of a speech-language pathologist at least 30% of the speech-language pathology assistant's actual student contact time per student for the first 90 days of initial employment as a speech-language pathology assistant. Thereafter, the speech-language pathology assistant must be under the direct supervision of a speech-language pathologist at least 20% of the speech-language pathology assistant's actual student contact time per student. Supervision of a speech-language pathology assistant beyond the minimum requirements of this subsection may be imposed at the discretion of the supervising speech-language pathologist. A supervising speech-language pathologist must be available to communicate with a speech-language pathology assistant whenever the assistant is in contact with a student.
    (h) A speech-language pathologist that supervises a speech-language pathology assistant must document direct supervision activities. At a minimum, supervision documentation must provide (i) information regarding the quality of the speech-language pathology assistant's performance of assigned duties and (ii) verification that clinical activity is limited to duties specified in this Section.
    (i) A full-time speech-language pathologist may supervise no more than 2 speech-language pathology assistants. A speech-language pathologist that does not work full-time may supervise no more than one speech-language pathology assistant.

    (105 ILCS 5/14-6.10)
    Sec. 14-6.10. Transfer of parental rights at the age of majority.
    (a) When a student who is eligible for special education under this Article reaches the majority age of 18 years, all rights accorded to the student's parents under this Article transfer to the student, except as provided in this Section. This transfer of rights also applies to students who are incarcerated in an adult or juvenile State or local correctional institution.

    (b) The school district must notify the student and the student's parents of the transfer of rights in writing at a meeting convened to review the student's individualized education program during the school year in which the student turns 17 years of age. At that time, the school district must provide the student with a copy of the Delegation of Rights form described in this Section. The school district must mail the notice and a copy of the Delegation of Rights form to the student and to the student's parents, addressed to their last known address, if they do not attend the meeting.

verification that the designee accepts the delegation.
        (D) It shall include declarations that the student

    Sec. 14-7.01. Children attending classes in another district.) If a child, resident of one school district, because of his disability, attends a class or school for any of such types of children in another school district, the school district in which he resides shall grant the proper permit, provide any necessary transportation, and pay to the school district maintaining the special educational facilities the per capita cost of educating such children.
    Such per capita cost shall be computed in the following manner. The cost of conducting and maintaining any special educational facility shall be first determined and shall include the following expenses applicable only to such educational facility under rules and regulations established by the State Board of Education as follows:
    (a) Salaries of teachers, professional workers, necessary non-certified workers, clerks, librarians, custodial employees, readers, and any district taxes specifically for their pension and retirement benefits.
    (b) Educational supplies and equipment including textbooks.
    (c) Administrative costs and communication.
    (d) Operation of physical plant including heat, light, water, repairs, and maintenance.
    (e) Auxiliary service, including up to 20% of transportation cost.
    (f) Depreciation of physical facilities at a rate of $200 per pupil, or the actual rental paid for the physical facilities calculated on a per pupil basis. From such total cost thus determined there shall be deducted the State reimbursement due on account of such educational program for the same year, not including any State reimbursement for special education transportation and offsetting federal revenue for the program, except federally funded health care reimbursement need not be deducted. Such net cost shall be divided by the average number of pupils in average daily enrollment in such special education facility for the school year in order to arrive at the net per capita tuition cost.
    If the child, resident of any school district, because of his disability, attends a class or school for any of such types of children maintained in a teacher training center supported by public funds or State institution of higher learning, the resident district shall provide any necessary transportation and shall be eligible to the transportation reimbursement provided in Section 14-13.01.
    A resident district may, upon request, provide transportation for residents of the district who meet the requirements, other than the specified age, of children with disabilities as defined in Section 14-1.02, who attend classes in another district, and shall make a charge for any such transportation in an amount equal to the cost thereof, including a reasonable allowance for depreciation of the vehicles used.

    (105 ILCS 5/14-7.02) (from Ch. 122, par. 14-7.02)
    Sec. 14-7.02. Children attending private schools, public out-of-state schools, public school residential facilities or private special education facilities. The General Assembly recognizes that non-public schools or special education facilities provide an important service in the educational system in Illinois.
    If because of his or her disability the special education program of a district is unable to meet the needs of a child and the child attends a non-public school or special education facility, a public out-of-state school or a special education facility owned and operated by a county government unit that provides special educational services required by the child and is in compliance with the appropriate rules and regulations of the State Superintendent of Education, the school district in which the child is a resident shall pay the actual cost of tuition for special education and related services provided during the regular school term and during the summer school term if the child's educational needs so require, excluding room, board and transportation costs charged the child by that non-public school or special education facility, public out-of-state school or county special education facility, or $4,500 per year, whichever is less, and shall provide him any necessary transportation. "Nonpublic special education facility" shall include a residential facility, within or without the State of Illinois, which provides special education and related services to meet the needs of the child by utilizing private schools or public schools, whether located on the site or off the site of the residential facility.
    The State Board of Education shall promulgate rules and regulations for determining when placement in a private special education facility is appropriate. Such rules and regulations shall take into account the various types of services needed by a child and the availability of such services to the particular child in the public school. In developing these rules and regulations the State Board of Education shall consult with the Advisory Council on Education of Children with Disabilities and hold public hearings to secure recommendations from parents, school personnel, and others concerned about this matter.
    The State Board of Education shall also promulgate rules and regulations for transportation to and from a residential school. Transportation to and from home to a residential school more than once each school term shall be subject to prior approval by the State Superintendent in accordance with the rules and regulations of the State Board.
    A school district making tuition payments pursuant to this Section is eligible for reimbursement from the State for the amount of such payments actually made in excess of the district per capita tuition charge for students not receiving special education services. Such reimbursement shall be approved in accordance with Section 14-12.01 and each district shall file its claims, computed in accordance with rules prescribed by the State Board of Education, on forms prescribed by the State Superintendent of Education. Data used as a basis of reimbursement claims shall be for the preceding regular school term and summer school term. Each school district shall transmit its claims to the State Board of Education on or before August 15. The State Board of Education, before approving any such claims, shall determine their accuracy and whether they are based upon services and facilities provided under approved programs. Upon approval the State Board shall cause vouchers to be prepared showing the amount due for payment of reimbursement claims to school districts, for transmittal to the State Comptroller on the 30th day of September, December, and March, respectively, and the final voucher, no later than June 20. If the money appropriated by the General Assembly for such purpose for any year is insufficient, it shall be apportioned on the basis of the claims approved.
    No child shall be placed in a special education program pursuant to this Section if the tuition cost for special education and related services increases more than 10 percent over the tuition cost for the previous school year or exceeds $4,500 per year unless such costs have been approved by the Illinois Purchased Care Review Board. The Illinois Purchased Care Review Board shall consist of the following persons, or their designees: the Directors of Children and Family Services, Public Health, Public Aid, and the Governor's Office of Management and Budget; the Secretary of Human Services; the State Superintendent of Education; and such other persons as the Governor may designate. The Review Board shall also consist of one non-voting member who is an administrator of a private, nonpublic, special education school. The Review Board shall establish rules and regulations for its determination of allowable costs and payments made by local school districts for special education, room and board, and other related services provided by non-public schools or special education facilities and shall establish uniform standards and criteria which it shall follow. The Review Board shall approve the usual and customary rate or rates of a special education program that (i) is offered by an out-of-state, non-public provider of integrated autism specific educational and autism specific residential services, (ii) offers 2 or more levels of residential care, including at least one locked facility, and (iii) serves 12 or fewer Illinois students.
    In determining rates based on allowable costs, the Review Board shall consider any wage increases awarded by the General Assembly to front line personnel defined as direct support persons, aides, front-line supervisors, qualified intellectual disabilities professionals, nurses, and non-administrative support staff working in service settings in community-based settings within the State and adjust customary rates or rates of a special education program to be equitable to the wage increase awarded to similar staff positions in a community residential setting. Any wage increase awarded by the General Assembly to front line personnel defined as direct support persons, aides, front-line supervisors, qualified intellectual disabilities professionals, nurses, and non-administrative support staff working in community-based settings within the State, including the $0.75 per hour increase contained in Public Act 100-23 and the $0.50 per hour increase included in Public Act 100-23, shall also be a basis for any facility covered by this Section to appeal its rate before the Review Board under the process defined in Title 89, Part 900, Section 340 of the Illinois Administrative Code. Illinois Administrative Code Title 89, Part 900, Section 342 shall be updated to recognize wage increases awarded to community-based settings to be a basis for appeal. However, any wage increase that is captured upon appeal from a previous year shall not be counted by the Review Board as revenue for the purpose of calculating a facility's future rate.
    Any definition used by the Review Board in administrative rule or policy to define "related organizations" shall include any and all exceptions contained in federal law or regulation as it pertains to the federal definition of "related organizations".
    The Review Board shall establish uniform definitions and criteria for accounting separately by special education, room and board and other related services costs. The Board shall also establish guidelines for the coordination of services and financial assistance provided by all State agencies to assure that no otherwise qualified child with a disability receiving services under Article 14 shall be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity provided by any State agency.
    The Review Board shall review the costs for special education and related services provided by non-public schools or special education facilities and shall approve or disapprove such facilities in accordance with the rules and regulations established by it with respect to allowable costs.
    The State Board of Education shall provide administrative and staff support for the Review Board as deemed reasonable by the State Superintendent of Education. This support shall not include travel expenses or other compensation for any Review Board member other than the State Superintendent of Education.
    The Review Board shall seek the advice of the Advisory Council on Education of Children with Disabilities on the rules and regulations to be promulgated by it relative to providing special education services.
    If a child has been placed in a program in which the actual per pupil costs of tuition for special education and related services based on program enrollment, excluding room, board and transportation costs, exceed $4,500 and such costs have been approved by the Review Board, the district shall pay such total costs which exceed $4,500. A district making such tuition payments in excess of $4,500 pursuant to this Section shall be responsible for an amount in excess of $4,500 equal to the district per capita tuition charge and shall be eligible for reimbursement from the State for the amount of such payments actually made in excess of the districts per capita tuition charge for students not receiving special education services.
    If a child has been placed in an approved individual program and the tuition costs including room and board costs have been approved by the Review Board, then such room and board costs shall be paid by the appropriate State agency subject to the provisions of Section 14-8.01 of this Act. Room and board costs not provided by a State agency other than the State Board of Education shall be provided by the State Board of Education on a current basis. In no event, however, shall the State's liability for funding of these tuition costs begin until after the legal obligations of third party payors have been subtracted from such costs. If the money appropriated by the General Assembly for such purpose for any year is insufficient, it shall be apportioned on the basis of the claims approved. Each district shall submit estimated claims to the State Superintendent of Education. Upon approval of such claims, the State Superintendent of Education shall direct the State Comptroller to make payments on a monthly basis. The frequency for submitting estimated claims and the method of determining payment shall be prescribed in rules and regulations adopted by the State Board of Education. Such current state reimbursement shall be reduced by an amount equal to the proceeds which the child or child's parents are eligible to receive under any public or private insurance or assistance program. Nothing in this Section shall be construed as relieving an insurer or similar third party from an otherwise valid obligation to provide or to pay for services provided to a child with a disability.
    If it otherwise qualifies, a school district is eligible for the transportation reimbursement under Section 14-13.01 and for the reimbursement of tuition payments under this Section whether the non-public school or special education facility, public out-of-state school or county special education facility, attended by a child who resides in that district and requires special educational services, is within or outside of the State of Illinois. However, a district is not eligible to claim transportation reimbursement under this Section unless the district certifies to the State Superintendent of Education that the district is unable to provide special educational services required by the child for the current school year.
    Nothing in this Section authorizes the reimbursement of a school district for the amount paid for tuition of a child attending a non-public school or special education facility, public out-of-state school or county special education facility unless the school district certifies to the State Superintendent of Education that the special education program of that district is unable to meet the needs of that child because of his disability and the State Superintendent of Education finds that the school district is in substantial compliance with Section 14-4.01. However, if a child is unilaterally placed by a State agency or any court in a non-public school or special education facility, public out-of-state school, or county special education facility, a school district shall not be required to certify to the State Superintendent of Education, for the purpose of tuition reimbursement, that the special education program of that district is unable to meet the needs of a child because of his or her disability.
    Any educational or related services provided, pursuant to this Section in a non-public school or special education facility or a special education facility owned and operated by a county government unit shall be at no cost to the parent or guardian of the child. However, current law and practices relative to contributions by parents or guardians for costs other than educational or related services are not affected by this amendatory Act of 1978.
    Reimbursement for children attending public school residential facilities shall be made in accordance with the provisions of this Section.
    Notwithstanding any other provision of law, any school district receiving a payment under this Section or under Section 14-7.02b, 14-13.01, or 29-5 of this Code may classify all or a portion of the funds that it receives in a particular fiscal year or from general State aid pursuant to Section 18-8.05 of this Code as funds received in connection with any funding program for which it is entitled to receive funds from the State in that fiscal year (including, without limitation, any funding program referenced in this Section), regardless of the source or timing of the receipt. The district may not classify more funds as funds received in connection with the funding program than the district is entitled to receive in that fiscal year for that program. Any classification by a district must be made by a resolution of its board of education. The resolution must identify the amount of any payments or general State aid to be classified under this paragraph and must specify the funding program to which the funds are to be treated as received in connection therewith. This resolution is controlling as to the classification of funds referenced therein. A certified copy of the resolution must be sent to the State Superintendent of Education. The resolution shall still take effect even though a copy of the resolution has not been sent to the State Superintendent of Education in a timely manner. No classification under this paragraph by a district shall affect the total amount or timing of money the district is entitled to receive under this Code. No classification under this paragraph by a district shall in any way relieve the district from or affect any requirements that otherwise would apply with respect to that funding program, including any accounting of funds by source, reporting expenditures by original source and purpose, reporting requirements, or requirements of providing services.

    The appropriation for fiscal year 2005 through fiscal year 2017 shall be based upon the IDEA child count of all students in the State, excluding students claimed under Sections 14-7.02 and 14-7.03 of this Code, on December 1 of the fiscal year 2 years preceding, multiplied by 17.5% of the general State aid foundation level of support established for that fiscal year under Section 18-8.05 of this Code.
    Beginning with fiscal year 2005 and through fiscal year 2007, individual school districts shall not receive payments under this Section totaling less than they received under the funding authorized under Section 14-7.02a of this Code during fiscal year 2004, pursuant to the provisions of Section 14-7.02a as they were in effect before the effective date of this amendatory Act of the 93rd General Assembly. This base level funding shall be computed first.
    Beginning with fiscal year 2008 through fiscal year 2017, individual school districts must not receive payments under this Section totaling less than they received in fiscal year 2007. This funding shall be computed last and shall be a separate calculation from any other calculation set forth in this Section. This amount is exempt from the requirements of Section 1D-1 of this Code.
    Through fiscal year 2017, an amount equal to 85% of the funds remaining in the appropriation shall be allocated to school districts based upon the district's average daily attendance reported for purposes of Section 18-8.05 of this Code for the preceding school year. Fifteen percent of the funds remaining in the appropriation shall be allocated to school districts based upon the district's low income eligible pupil count used in the calculation of general State aid under Section 18-8.05 of this Code for the same fiscal year. One hundred percent of the funds computed and allocated to districts under this Section shall be distributed and paid to school districts.
    For individual students with disabilities whose program costs exceed 4 times the district's per capita tuition rate as calculated under Section 10-20.12a of this Code, the costs in excess of 4 times the district's per capita tuition rate shall be paid by the State Board of Education from unexpended IDEA discretionary funds originally designated for room and board reimbursement pursuant to Section 14-8.01 of this Code. The amount of tuition for these children shall be determined by the actual cost of maintaining classes for these children, using the per capita cost formula set forth in Section 14-7.01 of this Code, with the program and cost being pre-approved by the State Superintendent of Education. Reimbursement for individual students with disabilities whose program costs exceed 4 times the district's per capita tuition rate shall be claimed beginning with costs encumbered for the 2004-2005 school year and thereafter.
    The State Board of Education shall prepare vouchers equal to one-fourth the amount allocated to districts, for transmittal to the State Comptroller on the 30th day of September, December, and March, respectively, and the final voucher, no later than June 20. The Comptroller shall make payments pursuant to this Section to school districts as soon as possible after receipt of vouchers. If the money appropriated from the General Assembly for such purposes for any year is insufficient, it shall be apportioned on the basis of the payments due to school districts.
    Nothing in this Section shall be construed to decrease or increase the percentage of all special education funds that are allocated annually under Article 1D of this Code or to alter the requirement that a school district provide special education services.
    Nothing in this amendatory Act of the 93rd General Assembly shall eliminate any reimbursement obligation owed as of the effective date of this amendatory Act of the 93rd General Assembly to a school district with in excess of 500,000 inhabitants.
    Except for reimbursement for individual students with disabilities whose program costs exceed 4 times the district's per capita tuition rate, no funding shall be provided to school districts under this Section after fiscal year 2017.
    In fiscal year 2018 and each fiscal year thereafter, all funding received by a school district from the State pursuant to Section 18–8.15 of this Code that is attributable to students requiring special education services must be used for special education services authorized under this Code.

    Sec. 14-7.02c. Private therapeutic day schools; student enrollment data. The Illinois Purchased Care Review Board must accept amended student enrollment data from special education private therapeutic day schools that have specialized contractual agreements with a school district having a population exceeding 500,000 inhabitants in the 2016-2017 and 2017-2018 school years. The amended student enrollment data must be based on actual monthly enrollment days where a student placed by the school district was formally enrolled and began to receive services through the last date he or she was formally exited from the therapeutic day school. All enrolled days must be confined to the official beginning and end dates of the therapeutic day school's official calendar on file with the State Board of Education. In no instance may the amended enrollment be further reduced to account for student absences. A school district having a population of 500,000 or less inhabitants must be billed at the per diem rate approved by the Illinois Purchased Care Review Board based on days enrolled as prescribed in Section 900.330 of Title 89 of the Illinois Administrative Code.

    Sec. 14-7.03. Special education classes for children from orphanages, foster family homes, children's homes, or State residential units. If a school district maintains special education classes on the site of orphanages and children's homes, or if children from the orphanages, children's homes, foster family homes, other State agencies, or State residential units for children attend classes for children with disabilities in which the school district is a participating member of a joint agreement, or if the children from the orphanages, children's homes, foster family homes, other State agencies, or State residential units attend classes for the children with disabilities maintained by the school district, then reimbursement shall be paid to eligible districts in accordance with the provisions of this Section by the Comptroller as directed by the State Superintendent of Education.
    The amount of tuition for such children shall be determined by the actual cost of maintaining such classes, using the per capita cost formula set forth in Section 14-7.01, such program and cost to be pre-approved by the State Superintendent of Education.
    If a school district makes a claim for reimbursement under Section 18-3 of this Code it shall not include in any claim filed under this Section a claim for such children. Payments authorized by law, including State or federal grants for education of children included in this Section, shall be deducted in determining the tuition amount.
    Nothing in this Code shall be construed so as to prohibit reimbursement for the tuition of children placed in for profit facilities. Private facilities shall provide adequate space at the facility for special education classes provided by a school district or joint agreement for children with disabilities who are residents of the facility at no cost to the school district or joint agreement upon request of the school district or joint agreement. If such a private facility provides space at no cost to the district or joint agreement for special education classes provided to children with disabilities who are residents of the facility, the district or joint agreement shall not include any costs for the use of those facilities in its claim for reimbursement.
    Reimbursement for tuition may include the cost of providing summer school programs for children with severe and profound disabilities served under this Section. Claims for that reimbursement shall be filed by November 1 and shall be paid on or before December 15 from appropriations made for the purposes of this Section.
    The State Board of Education shall establish such rules and regulations as may be necessary to implement the provisions of this Section.
    Claims filed on behalf of programs operated under this Section housed in an orphanage, children's home, private facility, State residential unit, district or joint agreement site, jail, detention center, or county-owned shelter care facility shall be on an individual student basis only for eligible students with disabilities. These claims shall be in accordance with applicable rules.
    Each district claiming reimbursement for individual students shall have the eligibility of those students verified by the State Board of Education. On September 30, December 31, and March 31, the State Board of Education shall voucher payments for individual students based upon an estimated cost calculated from the prior year's claim. Final claims for individual students for the regular school term must be received at the State Board of Education by June 15. Claims for individual students received after June 15 shall not be honored. Claims received by June 15 may be amended until August 1. Final claims for individual students shall be vouchered by August 31. However, notwithstanding any other provisions of this Section or this Code, if the amount appropriated for any fiscal year is less than the amount required for purposes of this Section, the amount required to eliminate any insufficient reimbursement for each district claim under this Section shall be reimbursed on August 31 of the next fiscal year. Payments required to eliminate any insufficiency for prior fiscal year claims shall be made before any claims are paid for the current fiscal year.
    Regional superintendents may operate special education classes for children from orphanages, foster family homes, children's homes, or State residential units located within the educational services region upon consent of the school board otherwise so obligated. In electing to assume the powers and duties of a school district in providing and maintaining such a special education program, the regional superintendent may enter into joint agreements with other districts and may contract with public or private schools or the orphanage, foster family home, children's home, or State residential unit for provision of the special education program. The regional superintendent exercising the powers granted under this Section shall be reimbursed for the actual cost of providing such programs by the resident district as defined in Section 14-1.11a.
    Any child who is not a resident of Illinois who is placed in a child welfare institution, private facility, foster family home, State operated program, orphanage, or children's home shall have the payment for his educational tuition and any related services assured by the placing agent.
    For each student with a disability who is placed in a residential facility by an Illinois public agency or by any court in this State, the costs for educating the student are eligible for reimbursement under this Section.
    The district of residence of the student with a disability as defined in Section 14-1.11a is responsible for the actual costs of the student's special education program and is eligible for reimbursement under this Section when placement is made by a State agency or the courts.
    When a dispute arises over the determination of the district of residence under this Section, the district or districts may appeal the decision in writing to the State Superintendent of Education, who, upon review of materials submitted and any other items or information he or she may request for submission, shall issue a written decision on the matter. The decision of the State Superintendent of Education shall be final.
    In the event a district does not make a tuition payment to another district that is providing the special education program and services, the State Board of Education shall immediately withhold 125% of the then remaining annual tuition cost from the State aid or categorical aid payment due to the school district that is determined to be the resident school district. All funds withheld by the State Board of Education shall immediately be forwarded to the school district where the student is being served.
    When a child eligible for services under this Section 14-7.03 must be placed in a nonpublic facility, that facility shall meet the programmatic requirements of Section 14-7.02 and its regulations, and the educational services shall be funded only in accordance with this Section 14-7.03.

    Sec. 14-7.04. Health care reimbursement.
    (a) Local educational agencies may utilize federally funded health care programs to share in the costs of services which are provided to children requiring special education and related services and which are either listed on an individualized education program established pursuant to the federal Education for All Handicapped Children Act of 1975, Public Law No. 94-142 or are provided under an individualized family service plan established pursuant to the federal Education of the Handicapped Act Amendments of 1986, Public Law No. 99-457. Those federally funded health care programs shall also share in the cost of all screenings and diagnostic evaluations for children suspected of having or known to have a disability. However, all such services shall continue to be initially funded by the local educational agency and shall be provided regardless of subsequent cost sharing with other funding sources. Federally funded health care reimbursement funds are supplemental and shall not be used to reduce any other Federal payments, private payments or State Board of Education funds for special education as provided in Article 14 of the School Code for which the local education agency is eligible.
    Local educational agencies providing early periodic screening and diagnostic testing services on or after August 1, 1991, including screening and diagnostic services, health care and treatment, preventive health care, and any other measure to correct or improve health impairments of Medicaid-eligible children, may also access federally funded health care resources.
    The State Board of Education and the Department of Healthcare and Family Services may enter into an intergovernmental agreement whereby school districts or their agents may claim medicaid matching funds for medicaid eligible special education children as authorized by Section 1903 of the Social Security Act. Under that intergovernmental agreement, school districts or their agents may also claim federal funds for the services provided to special education students enrolled in the Children's Health Insurance Program.
    (b) No employee or officer of a school district, special education joint agreement, office of a regional superintendent of schools or the State Board of Education may have a direct or indirect financial interest in any agreement between the entity of which the person is an employee or officer and any corporation, organization or other entity that collects or participates in the collection of payments from private health care benefit plans or federally funded health care programs authorized under this Section.

    Sec. 14-7.05. Placement in residential facility; payment of educational costs. For any student with a disability in a residential facility placement made or paid for by an Illinois public State agency or made by any court in this State, the school district of residence as determined pursuant to this Article is responsible for the costs of educating the child and shall be reimbursed for those costs in accordance with this Code. Subject to this Section and relevant State appropriation, the resident district's financial responsibility and reimbursement must be calculated in accordance with the provisions of Section 14-7.02 of this Code. In those instances in which a district receives a block grant pursuant to Article 1D of this Code, the district's financial responsibility is limited to the actual educational costs of the placement, which must be paid by the district from its block grant appropriation. Resident district financial responsibility and reimbursement applies for both residential facilities that are approved by the State Board of Education and non-approved facilities, subject to the requirements of this Section. The Illinois placing agency or court remains responsible for funding the residential portion of the placement and for notifying the resident district prior to the placement, except in emergency situations. The residential facility in which the student is placed shall notify the resident district of the student's enrollment as soon as practicable after the placement. Failure of the placing agency or court to notify the resident district prior to the placement does not absolve the resident district of financial responsibility for the educational costs of the placement; however, the resident district shall not become financially responsible unless and until it receives written notice of the placement by either the placing agency, court, or residential facility. The placing agency or parent shall request an individualized education program (IEP) meeting from the resident district if the placement would entail additional educational services beyond the student's current IEP. The district of residence shall retain control of the IEP process, and any changes to the IEP must be done in compliance with the federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act.
    Payments shall be made by the resident district to the entity providing the educational services, whether the entity is the residential facility or the school district wherein the facility is located, no less than once per quarter unless otherwise agreed to in writing by the parties.
    A residential facility providing educational services within the facility, but not approved by the State Board of Education, is required to demonstrate proof to the State Board of (i) appropriate certification of teachers for the student population, (ii) age-appropriate curriculum, (iii) enrollment and attendance data, and (iv) the ability to implement the child's IEP. A school district is under no obligation to pay such a residential facility unless and until such proof is provided to the State Board's satisfaction.
    When a dispute arises over the determination of the district of residence under this Section, any person or entity, including without limitation a school district or residential facility, may make a written request for a residency decision to the State Superintendent of Education, who, upon review of materials submitted and any other items of information he or she may request for submission, shall issue his or her decision in writing. The decision of the State Superintendent of Education is final.

    Sec. 14-8.01. Supervision of special education buildings and facilities. All special educational facilities, building programs, housing, and all educational programs for the types of children with disabilities defined in Section 14-1.02 shall be under the supervision of and subject to the approval of the State Board of Education.
    All special education facilities, building programs, and housing shall comply with the building code authorized by Section 2-3.12.
    All educational programs for children with disabilities as defined in Section 14-1.02 administered by any State agency shall be under the general supervision of the State Board of Education. Such supervision shall be limited to insuring that such educational programs meet standards jointly developed and agreed to by both the State Board of Education and the operating State agency, including standards for educational personnel.
    Any State agency providing special educational programs for children with disabilities as defined in Section 14-1.02 shall promulgate rules and regulations, in consultation with the State Board of Education and pursuant to the Illinois Administrative Procedure Act as now or hereafter amended, to insure that all such programs comply with this Section and Section 14-8.02.
    No otherwise qualified child with a disability receiving special education and related services under Article 14 shall solely by reason of his or her disability be excluded from the participation in or be denied the benefits of or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity provided by a State agency.
    State agencies providing special education and related services, including room and board, either directly or through grants or purchases of services shall continue to provide these services according to current law and practice. Room and board costs not provided by a State agency other than the State Board of Education shall be provided by the State Board of Education to the extent of available funds. An amount equal to one-half of the State education agency's share of IDEA PART B federal monies, or so much thereof as may actually be needed, shall annually be appropriated to pay for the additional costs of providing for room and board for those children placed pursuant to Section 14-7.02 of this Code and, after all such room and board costs are paid, for similar expenditures for children served pursuant to Section 14-7.02 or 14-7.02b of this Code. Any such excess room and board funds must first be directed to those school districts with students costing in excess of 4 times the district's per capita tuition charge and then to community based programs that serve as alternatives to residential placements.
    Beginning with Fiscal Year 1997 and continuing through Fiscal Year 2000, 100% of the former Chapter I, Section 89-313 federal funds shall be allocated by the State Board of Education in the same manner as IDEA, PART B "flow through" funding to local school districts, joint agreements, and special education cooperatives for the maintenance of instructional and related support services to students with disabilities. However, beginning with Fiscal Year 1998, the total IDEA Part B discretionary funds available to the State Board of Education shall not exceed the maximum permissible under federal law or 20% of the total federal funds available to the State, whichever is less. After all room and board payments and similar expenditures are made by the State Board of Education as required by this Section, the State Board of Education may use the remaining funds for administration and for providing discretionary activities. However, the State Board of Education may use no more than 25% of its available IDEA Part B discretionary funds for administrative services.
    Special education and related services included in the child's individualized educational program which are not provided by another State agency shall be included in the special education and related services provided by the State Board of Education and the local school district.
    The State Board of Education with the advice of the Advisory Council shall prescribe the standards and make the necessary rules and regulations for special education programs administered by local school boards, including but not limited to establishment of classes, training requirements of teachers and other professional personnel, eligibility and admission of pupils, the curriculum, class size limitation, building programs, housing, transportation, special equipment and instructional supplies, and the applications for claims for reimbursement. The State Board of Education shall promulgate rules and regulations for annual evaluations of the effectiveness of all special education programs and annual evaluation by the local school district of the individualized educational program for each child for whom it provides special education services.
    A school district is responsible for the provision of educational services for all school age children residing within its boundaries excluding any student placed under the provisions of Section 14-7.02 or any student with a disability whose parent or guardian lives outside of the State of Illinois as described in Section 14-1.11.

    Sec. 14-8.02. Identification, evaluation, and placement of children.
    (a) The State Board of Education shall make rules under which local school boards shall determine the eligibility of children to receive special education. Such rules shall ensure that a free appropriate public education be available to all children with disabilities as defined in Section 14-1.02. The State Board of Education shall require local school districts to administer non-discriminatory procedures or tests to English learners coming from homes in which a language other than English is used to determine their eligibility to receive special education. The placement of low English proficiency students in special education programs and facilities shall be made in accordance with the test results reflecting the student's linguistic, cultural and special education needs. For purposes of determining the eligibility of children the State Board of Education shall include in the rules definitions of "case study", "staff conference", "individualized educational program", and "qualified specialist" appropriate to each category of children with disabilities as defined in this Article. For purposes of determining the eligibility of children from homes in which a language other than English is used, the State Board of Education shall include in the rules definitions for "qualified bilingual specialists" and "linguistically and culturally appropriate individualized educational programs". For purposes of this Section, as well as Sections 14-8.02a, 14-8.02b, and 14-8.02c of this Code, "parent" means a parent as defined in the federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (20 U.S.C. 1401(23)).
    (b) No child shall be eligible for special education facilities except with a carefully completed case study fully reviewed by professional personnel in a multidisciplinary staff conference and only upon the recommendation of qualified specialists or a qualified bilingual specialist, if available. At the conclusion of the multidisciplinary staff conference, the parent of the child shall be given a copy of the multidisciplinary conference summary report and recommendations, which includes options considered, and be informed of their right to obtain an independent educational evaluation if they disagree with the evaluation findings conducted or obtained by the school district. If the school district's evaluation is shown to be inappropriate, the school district shall reimburse the parent for the cost of the independent evaluation. The State Board of Education shall, with advice from the State Advisory Council on Education of Children with Disabilities on the inclusion of specific independent educational evaluators, prepare a list of suggested independent educational evaluators. The State Board of Education shall include on the list clinical psychologists licensed pursuant to the Clinical Psychologist Licensing Act. Such psychologists shall not be paid fees in excess of the amount that would be received by a school psychologist for performing the same services. The State Board of Education shall supply school districts with such list and make the list available to parents at their request. School districts shall make the list available to parents at the time they are informed of their right to obtain an independent educational evaluation. However, the school district may initiate an impartial due process hearing under this Section within 5 days of any written parent request for an independent educational evaluation to show that its evaluation is appropriate. If the final decision is that the evaluation is appropriate, the parent still has a right to an independent educational evaluation, but not at public expense. An independent educational evaluation at public expense must be completed within 30 days of a parent written request unless the school district initiates an impartial due process hearing or the parent or school district offers reasonable grounds to show that such 30 day time period should be extended. If the due process hearing decision indicates that the parent is entitled to an independent educational evaluation, it must be completed within 30 days of the decision unless the parent or the school district offers reasonable grounds to show that such 30 day period should be extended. If a parent disagrees with the summary report or recommendations of the multidisciplinary conference or the findings of any educational evaluation which results therefrom, the school district shall not proceed with a placement based upon such evaluation and the child shall remain in his or her regular classroom setting. No child shall be eligible for admission to a special class for children with a mental disability who are educable or for children with a mental disability who are trainable except with a psychological evaluation and recommendation by a school psychologist. Consent shall be obtained from the parent of a child before any evaluation is conducted. If consent is not given by the parent or if the parent disagrees with the findings of the evaluation, then the school district may initiate an impartial due process hearing under this Section. The school district may evaluate the child if that is the decision resulting from the impartial due process hearing and the decision is not appealed or if the decision is affirmed on appeal. The determination of eligibility shall be made and the IEP meeting shall be completed within 60 school days from the date of written parental consent. In those instances when written parental consent is obtained with fewer than 60 pupil attendance days left in the school year, the eligibility determination shall be made and the IEP meeting shall be completed prior to the first day of the following school year. Special education and related services must be provided in accordance with the student's IEP no later than 10 school attendance days after notice is provided to the parents pursuant to Section 300.503 of Title 34 of the Code of Federal Regulations and implementing rules adopted by the State Board of Education. The appropriate program pursuant to the individualized educational program of students whose native tongue is a language other than English shall reflect the special education, cultural and linguistic needs. No later than September 1, 1993, the State Board of Education shall establish standards for the development, implementation and monitoring of appropriate bilingual special individualized educational programs. The State Board of Education shall further incorporate appropriate monitoring procedures to verify implementation of these standards. The district shall indicate to the parent and the State Board of Education the nature of the services the child will receive for the regular school term while waiting placement in the appropriate special education class. At the child's initial IEP meeting and at each annual review meeting, the child's IEP team shall provide the child's parent or guardian with a written notification that informs the parent or guardian that the IEP team is required to consider whether the child requires assistive technology in order to receive free, appropriate public education. The notification must also include a toll-free telephone number and internet address for the State's assistive technology program.
    If the child is deaf, hard of hearing, blind, or visually impaired and he or she might be eligible to receive services from the Illinois School for the Deaf or the Illinois School for the Visually Impaired, the school district shall notify the parents, in writing, of the existence of these schools and the services they provide and shall make a reasonable effort to inform the parents of the existence of other, local schools that provide similar services and the services that these other schools provide. This notification shall include without limitation information on school services, school admissions criteria, and school contact information.
    In the development of the individualized education program for a student who has a disability on the autism spectrum (which includes autistic disorder, Asperger's disorder, pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified, childhood disintegrative disorder, and Rett Syndrome, as defined in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fourth edition (DSM-IV, 2000)), the IEP team shall consider all of the following factors:
        (1) The verbal and nonverbal communication needs of
    	
the child.
        (2) The need to develop social interaction skills
    	
and proficiencies.
        (3) The needs resulting from the child's unusual
    	
responses to sensory experiences.
        (4) The needs resulting from resistance to
    	
environmental change or change in daily routines.
        (5) The needs resulting from engagement in
    	
repetitive activities and stereotyped movements.
        (6) The need for any positive behavioral
    	
interventions, strategies, and supports to address any behavioral difficulties resulting from autism spectrum disorder.
        (7) Other needs resulting from the child's
    	
disability that impact progress in the general curriculum, including social and emotional development.
Public Act 95-257 does not create any new entitlement to a service, program, or benefit, but must not affect any entitlement to a service, program, or benefit created by any other law.
    If the student may be eligible to participate in the Home-Based Support Services Program for Adults with Mental Disabilities authorized under the Developmental Disability and Mental Disability Services Act upon becoming an adult, the student's individualized education program shall include plans for (i) determining the student's eligibility for those home-based services, (ii) enrolling the student in the program of home-based services, and (iii) developing a plan for the student's most effective use of the home-based services after the student becomes an adult and no longer receives special educational services under this Article. The plans developed under this paragraph shall include specific actions to be taken by specified individuals, agencies, or officials.
    (c) In the development of the individualized education program for a student who is functionally blind, it shall be presumed that proficiency in Braille reading and writing is essential for the student's satisfactory educational progress. For purposes of this subsection, the State Board of Education shall determine the criteria for a student to be classified as functionally blind. Students who are not currently identified as functionally blind who are also entitled to Braille instruction include: (i) those whose vision loss is so severe that they are unable to read and write at a level comparable to their peers solely through the use of vision, and (ii) those who show evidence of progressive vision loss that may result in functional blindness. Each student who is functionally blind shall be entitled to Braille reading and writing instruction that is sufficient to enable the student to communicate with the same level of proficiency as other students of comparable ability. Instruction should be provided to the extent that the student is physically and cognitively able to use Braille. Braille instruction may be used in combination with other special education services appropriate to the student's educational needs. The assessment of each student who is functionally blind for the purpose of developing the student's individualized education program shall include documentation of the student's strengths and weaknesses in Braille skills. Each person assisting in the development of the individualized education program for a student who is functionally blind shall receive information describing the benefits of Braille instruction. The individualized education program for each student who is functionally blind shall specify the appropriate learning medium or media based on the assessment report.
    (d) To the maximum extent appropriate, the placement shall provide the child with the opportunity to be educated with children who do not have a disability; provided that children with disabilities who are recommended to be placed into regular education classrooms are provided with supplementary services to assist the children with disabilities to benefit from the regular classroom instruction and are included on the teacher's regular education class register. Subject to the limitation of the preceding sentence, placement in special classes, separate schools or other removal of the child with a disability from the regular educational environment shall occur only when the nature of the severity of the disability is such that education in the regular classes with the use of supplementary aids and services cannot be achieved satisfactorily. The placement of English learners with disabilities shall be in non-restrictive environments which provide for integration with peers who do not have disabilities in bilingual classrooms. Annually, each January, school districts shall report data on students from non-English speaking backgrounds receiving special education and related services in public and private facilities as prescribed in Section 2-3.30. If there is a disagreement between parties involved regarding the special education placement of any child, either in-state or out-of-state, the placement is subject to impartial due process procedures described in Article 10 of the Rules and Regulations to Govern the Administration and Operation of Special Education.
    (e) No child who comes from a home in which a language other than English is the principal language used may be assigned to any class or program under this Article until he has been given, in the principal language used by the child and used in his home, tests reasonably related to his cultural environment. All testing and evaluation materials and procedures utilized for evaluation and placement shall not be linguistically, racially or culturally discriminatory.
    (f) Nothing in this Article shall be construed to require any child to undergo any physical examination or medical treatment whose parents object thereto on the grounds that such examination or treatment conflicts with his religious beliefs.
    (g) School boards or their designee shall provide to the parents of a child prior written notice of any decision (a) proposing to initiate or change, or (b) refusing to initiate or change, the identification, evaluation, or educational placement of the child or the provision of a free appropriate public education to their child, and the reasons therefor. Such written notification shall also inform the parent of the opportunity to present complaints with respect to any matter relating to the educational placement of the student, or the provision of a free appropriate public education and to have an impartial due process hearing on the complaint. The notice shall inform the parents in the parents' native language, unless it is clearly not feasible to do so, of their rights and all procedures available pursuant to this Act and the federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Improvement Act of 2004 (Public Law 108-446); it shall be the responsibility of the State Superintendent to develop uniform notices setting forth the procedures available under this Act and the federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Improvement Act of 2004 (Public Law 108-446) to be used by all school boards. The notice shall also inform the parents of the availability upon request of a list of free or low-cost legal and other relevant services available locally to assist parents in initiating an impartial due process hearing. The State Superintendent shall revise the uniform notices required by this subsection (g) to reflect current law and procedures at least once every 2 years. Any parent who is deaf, or does not normally communicate using spoken English, who participates in a meeting with a representative of a local educational agency for the purposes of developing an individualized educational program shall be entitled to the services of an interpreter. The State Board of Education must adopt rules to establish the criteria, standards, and competencies for a bilingual language interpreter who attends an individualized education program meeting under this subsection to assist a parent who has limited English proficiency.
    (g-5) For purposes of this subsection (g-5), "qualified professional" means an individual who holds credentials to evaluate the child in the domain or domains for which an evaluation is sought or an intern working under the direct supervision of a qualified professional, including a master's or doctoral degree candidate.
    To ensure that a parent can participate fully and effectively with school personnel in the development of appropriate educational and related services for his or her child, the parent, an independent educational evaluator, or a qualified professional retained by or on behalf of a parent or child must be afforded reasonable access to educational facilities, personnel, classrooms, and buildings and to the child as provided in this subsection (g-5). The requirements of this subsection (g-5) apply to any public school facility, building, or program and to any facility, building, or program supported in whole or in part by public funds. Prior to visiting a school, school building, or school facility, the parent, independent educational evaluator, or qualified professional may be required by the school district to inform the building principal or supervisor in writing of the proposed visit, the purpose of the visit, and the approximate duration of the visit. The visitor and the school district shall arrange the visit or visits at times that are mutually agreeable. Visitors shall comply with school safety, security, and visitation policies at all times. School district visitation policies must not conflict with this subsection (g-5). Visitors shall be required to comply with the requirements of applicable privacy laws, including those laws protecting the confidentiality of education records such as the federal Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act and the Illinois School Student Records Act. The visitor shall not disrupt the educational process.
        (1) A parent must be afforded reasonable access of
    	
sufficient duration and scope for the purpose of observing his or her child in the child's current educational placement, services, or program or for the purpose of visiting an educational placement or program proposed for the child.
        (2) An independent educational evaluator or a
    	
qualified professional retained by or on behalf of a parent or child must be afforded reasonable access of sufficient duration and scope for the purpose of conducting an evaluation of the child, the child's performance, the child's current educational program, placement, services, or environment, or any educational program, placement, services, or environment proposed for the child, including interviews of educational personnel, child observations, assessments, tests or assessments of the child's educational program, services, or placement or of any proposed educational program, services, or placement. If one or more interviews of school personnel are part of the evaluation, the interviews must be conducted at a mutually agreed upon time, date, and place that do not interfere with the school employee's school duties. The school district may limit interviews to personnel having information relevant to the child's current educational services, program, or placement or to a proposed educational service, program, or placement.

    Sec. 14-8.02a. Impartial due process hearing; civil action.
    (a) This Section shall apply to all impartial due process hearings requested on or after July 1, 2005. Impartial due process hearings requested before July 1, 2005 shall be governed by the rules described in Public Act 89-652.
    (a-5) For purposes of this Section and Section 14-8.02b of this Code, days shall be computed in accordance with Section 1.11 of the Statute on Statutes.
    (b) The State Board of Education shall establish an impartial due process hearing system in accordance with this Section and may, with the advice and approval of the Advisory Council on Education of Children with Disabilities, promulgate rules and regulations consistent with this Section to establish the rules and procedures for due process hearings.
    (c) (Blank).
    (d) (Blank).
    (e) (Blank).
    (f) An impartial due process hearing shall be convened upon the request of a parent, student if at least 18 years of age or emancipated, or a school district. A school district shall make a request in writing to the State Board of Education and promptly mail a copy of the request to the parents or student (if at least 18 years of age or emancipated) at the parent's or student's last known address. A request made by the parent or student shall be made in writing to the superintendent of the school district where the student resides. The superintendent shall forward the request to the State Board of Education within 5 days after receipt of the request. The request shall be filed no more than 2 years following the date the person or school district knew or should have known of the event or events forming the basis for the request. The request shall, at a minimum, contain all of the following:
        (1) The name of the student, the address of the
    	
student's residence, and the name of the school the student is attending.
        (2) In the case of homeless children (as defined
    	
under the federal McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. 11434a(2))), available contact information for the student and the name of the school the student is attending.
        (3) A description of the nature of the problem
    	
relating to the actual or proposed placement, identification, services, or evaluation of the student, including facts relating to the problem.
        (4) A proposed resolution of the problem to the
    	
extent known and available to the party at the time.
    (f-5) Within 3 days after receipt of the hearing request, the State Board of Education shall appoint a due process hearing officer using a rotating appointment system and shall notify the hearing officer of his or her appointment.
    For a school district other than a school district located in a municipality having a population exceeding 500,000, a hearing officer who is a current resident of the school district, special education cooperative, or other public entity involved in the hearing shall recuse himself or herself. A hearing officer who is a former employee of the school district, special education cooperative, or other public entity involved in the hearing shall immediately disclose the former employment to the parties and shall recuse himself or herself, unless the parties otherwise agree in writing. A hearing officer having a personal or professional interest that may conflict with his or her objectivity in the hearing shall disclose the conflict to the parties and shall recuse himself or herself unless the parties otherwise agree in writing. For purposes of this subsection an assigned hearing officer shall be considered to have a conflict of interest if, at any time prior to the issuance of his or her written decision, he or she knows or should know that he or she may receive remuneration from a party to the hearing within 3 years following the conclusion of the due process hearing.
    A party to a due process hearing shall be permitted one substitution of hearing officer as a matter of right, in accordance with procedures established by the rules adopted by the State Board of Education under this Section. The State Board of Education shall randomly select and appoint another hearing officer within 3 days after receiving notice that the appointed hearing officer is ineligible to serve or upon receiving a proper request for substitution of hearing officer. If a party withdraws its request for a due process hearing after a hearing officer has been appointed, that hearing officer shall retain jurisdiction over a subsequent hearing that involves the same parties and is requested within one year from the date of withdrawal of the previous request, unless that hearing officer is unavailable.
    Any party may raise facts that constitute a conflict of interest for the hearing officer at any time before or during the hearing and may move for recusal.
    (g) Impartial due process hearings shall be conducted pursuant to this Section and any rules and regulations promulgated by the State Board of Education consistent with this Section and other governing laws and regulations. The hearing shall address only those issues properly raised in the hearing request under subsection (f) of this Section or, if applicable, in the amended hearing request under subsection (g-15) of this Section. The hearing shall be closed to the public unless the parents request that the hearing be open to the public. The parents involved in the hearing shall have the right to have the student who is the subject of the hearing present. The hearing shall be held at a time and place which are reasonably convenient to the parties involved. Upon the request of a party, the hearing officer shall hold the hearing at a location neutral to the parties if the hearing officer determines that there is no cost for securing the use of the neutral location. Once appointed, the impartial due process hearing officer shall not communicate with the State Board of Education or its employees concerning the hearing, except that, where circumstances require, communications for administrative purposes that do not deal with substantive or procedural matters or issues on the merits are authorized, provided that the hearing officer promptly notifies all parties of the substance of the communication as a matter of record.
    (g-5) Unless the school district has previously provided prior written notice to the parent or student (if at least 18 years of age or emancipated) regarding the subject matter of the hearing request, the school district shall, within 10 days after receiving a hearing request initiated by a parent or student (if at least 18 years of age or emancipated), provide a written response to the request that shall include all of the following:
        (1) An explanation of why the school district
    	
proposed or refused to take the action or actions described in the hearing request.
        (2) A description of other options the IEP team
    	
considered and the reasons why those options were rejected.
        (3) A description of each evaluation procedure,
    	
assessment, record, report, or other evidence the school district used as the basis for the proposed or refused action or actions.
        (4) A description of the factors that are or were
    	
relevant to the school district's proposed or refused action or actions.
    (g-10) When the hearing request has been initiated by a school district, within 10 days after receiving the request, the parent or student (if at least 18 years of age or emancipated) shall provide the school district with a response that specifically addresses the issues raised in the school district's hearing request. The parent's or student's response shall be provided in writing, unless he or she is illiterate or has a disability that prevents him or her from providing a written response. The parent's or student's response may be provided in his or her native language, if other than English. In the event that illiteracy or another disabling condition prevents the parent or student from providing a written response, the school district shall assist the parent or student in providing the written response.
    (g-15) Within 15 days after receiving notice of the hearing request, the non-requesting party may challenge the sufficiency of the request by submitting its challenge in writing to the hearing officer. Within 5 days after receiving the challenge to the sufficiency of the request, the hearing officer shall issue a determination of the challenge in writing to the parties. In the event that the hearing officer upholds the challenge, the party who requested the hearing may, with the consent of the non-requesting party or hearing officer, file an amended request. Amendments are permissible for the purpose of raising issues beyond those in the initial hearing request. In addition, the party who requested the hearing may amend the request once as a matter of right by filing the amended request within 5 days after filing the initial request. An amended request, other than an amended request as a matter of right, shall be filed by the date determined by the hearing officer, but in no event any later than 5 days prior to the date of the hearing. If an amended request, other than an amended request as a matter of right, raises issues that were not part of the initial request, the applicable timeline for a hearing, including the timeline under subsection (g-20) of this Section, shall recommence.
    (g-20) Within 15 days after receiving a request for a hearing from a parent or student (if at least 18 years of age or emancipated) or, in the event that the school district requests a hearing, within 15 days after initiating the request, the school district shall convene a resolution meeting with the parent and relevant members of the IEP team who have specific knowledge of the facts contained in the request for the purpose of resolving the problem that resulted in the request. The resolution meeting shall include a representative of the school district who has decision-making authority on behalf of the school district. Unless the parent is accompanied by an attorney at the resolution meeting, the school district may not include an attorney representing the school district.
    The resolution meeting may not be waived unless agreed to in writing by the school district and the parent or student (if at least 18 years of age or emancipated) or the parent or student (if at least 18 years of age or emancipated) and the school district agree in writing to utilize mediation in place of the resolution meeting. If either party fails to cooperate in the scheduling or convening of the resolution meeting, the hearing officer may order an extension of the timeline for completion of the resolution meeting or, upon the motion of a party and at least 7 days after ordering the non-cooperating party to cooperate, order the dismissal of the hearing request or the granting of all relief set forth in the request, as appropriate.
    In the event that the school district and the parent or student (if at least 18 years of age or emancipated) agree to a resolution of the problem that resulted in the hearing request, the terms of the resolution shall be committed to writing and signed by the parent or student (if at least 18 years of age or emancipated) and the representative of the school district with decision-making authority. The agreement shall be legally binding and shall be enforceable in any State or federal court of competent jurisdiction. In the event that the parties utilize the resolution meeting process, the process shall continue until no later than the 30th day following the receipt of the hearing request by the non-requesting party (or as properly extended by order of the hearing officer) to resolve the issues underlying the request, at which time the timeline for completion of the impartial due process hearing shall commence. The State Board of Education may, by rule, establish additional procedures for the conduct of resolution meetings.
    (g-25) If mutually agreed to in writing, the parties to a hearing request may request State-sponsored mediation as a substitute for the resolution process described in subsection (g-20) of this Section or may utilize mediation at the close of the resolution process if all issues underlying the hearing request have not been resolved through the resolution process.
    (g-30) If mutually agreed to in writing, the parties to a hearing request may waive the resolution process described in subsection (g-20) of this Section. Upon signing a written agreement to waive the resolution process, the parties shall be required to forward the written waiver to the hearing officer appointed to the case within 2 business days following the signing of the waiver by the parties. The timeline for the impartial due process hearing shall commence on the date of the signing of the waiver by the parties.
    (g-35) The timeline for completing the impartial due process hearing, as set forth in subsection (h) of this Section, shall be initiated upon the occurrence of any one of the following events:
        (1) The unsuccessful completion of the resolution
    	
process as described in subsection (g-20) of this Section.
        (2) The mutual agreement of the parties to waive the
    	
resolution process as described in subsection (g-25) or (g-30) of this Section.
    (g-40) The hearing officer shall convene a prehearing conference no later than 14 days before the scheduled date for the due process hearing for the general purpose of aiding in the fair, orderly, and expeditious conduct of the hearing. The hearing officer shall provide the parties with written notice of the prehearing conference at least 7 days in advance of the conference. The written notice shall require the parties to notify the hearing officer by a date certain whether they intend to participate in the prehearing conference. The hearing officer may conduct the prehearing conference in person or by telephone. Each party shall at the prehearing conference (1) disclose whether it is represented by legal counsel or intends to retain legal counsel; (2) clarify matters it believes to be in dispute in the case and the specific relief being sought; (3) disclose whether there are any additional evaluations for the student that it intends to introduce into the hearing record that have not been previously disclosed to the other parties; (4) disclose a list of all documents it intends to introduce into the hearing record, including the date and a brief description of each document; and (5) disclose the names of all witnesses it intends to call to testify at the hearing. The hearing officer shall specify the order of presentation to be used at the hearing. If the prehearing conference is held by telephone, the parties shall transmit the information required in this paragraph in such a manner that it is available to all parties at the time of the prehearing conference. The State Board of Education may, by rule, establish additional procedures for the conduct of prehearing conferences.
    (g-45) The impartial due process hearing officer shall not initiate or participate in any ex parte communications with the parties, except to arrange the date, time, and location of the prehearing conference, due process hearing, or other status conferences convened at the discretion of the hearing officer and to receive confirmation of whether a party intends to participate in the prehearing conference.
    (g-50) The parties shall disclose and provide to each other any evidence which they intend to submit into the hearing record no later than 5 days before the hearing. Any party to a hearing has the right to prohibit the introduction of any evidence at the hearing that has not been disclosed to that party at least 5 days before the hearing. The party requesting a hearing shall not be permitted at the hearing to raise issues that were not raised in the party's initial or amended request, unless otherwise permitted in this Section.
    (g-55) All reasonable efforts must be made by the parties to present their respective cases at the hearing within a cumulative period of 7 days. When scheduling hearing dates, the hearing officer shall schedule the final day of the hearing no more than 30 calendar days after the first day of the hearing unless good cause is shown. This subsection (g-55) shall not be applied in a manner that (i) denies any party to the hearing a fair and reasonable allocation of time and opportunity to present its case in its entirety or (ii) deprives any party to the hearing of the safeguards accorded under the federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Improvement Act of 2004 (Public Law 108-446), regulations promulgated under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Improvement Act of 2004, or any other applicable law. The school district shall present evidence that the special education needs of the child have been appropriately identified and that the special education program and related services proposed to meet the needs of the child are adequate, appropriate, and available. Any party to the hearing shall have the right to (1) be represented by counsel and be accompanied and advised by individuals with special knowledge or training with respect to the problems of children with disabilities, at the party's own expense; (2) present evidence and confront and cross-examine witnesses; (3) move for the exclusion of witnesses from the hearing until they are called to testify, provided, however, that this provision may not be invoked to exclude the individual designated by a party to assist that party or its representative in the presentation of the case; (4) obtain a written or electronic verbatim record of the proceedings within 30 days of receipt of a written request from the parents by the school district; and (5) obtain a written decision, including findings of fact and conclusions of law, within 10 calendar days, excluding Saturday, Sunday, and any State holiday, after the conclusion of the hearing. If at issue, the school district shall present evidence that it has properly identified and evaluated the nature and severity of the student's suspected or identified disability and that, if the student has been or should have been determined eligible for special education and related services, that it is providing or has offered a free appropriate public education to the student in the least restrictive environment, consistent with procedural safeguards and in accordance with an individualized educational program. At any time prior to the conclusion of the hearing, the impartial due process hearing officer shall have the authority to require additional information and order independent evaluations for the student at the expense of the school district. The State Board of Education and the school district shall share equally the costs of providing a written or electronic verbatim record of the proceedings. Any party may request that the due process hearing officer issue a subpoena to compel the testimony of witnesses or the production of documents relevant to the resolution of the hearing. Whenever a person refuses to comply with any subpoena issued under this Section, the circuit court of the county in which that hearing is pending, on application of the impartial hearing officer or the party requesting the issuance of the subpoena, may compel compliance through the contempt powers of the court in the same manner as if the requirements of a subpoena issued by the court had been disobeyed.
    (h) The impartial hearing officer shall issue a written decision, including findings of fact and conclusions of law, within 10 calendar days, excluding Saturday, Sunday, and any State holiday, after the conclusion of the hearing and send by certified mail a copy of the decision to the parents or student (if the student requests the hearing), the school district, the director of special education, legal representatives of the parties, and the State Board of Education. Unless the hearing officer has granted specific extensions of time at the request of a party, a final decision, including the clarification of a decision requested under this subsection, shall be reached and mailed to the parties named above not later than 45 days after the initiation of the timeline for conducting the hearing, as described in subsection (g-35) of this Section. The decision shall specify the educational and related services that shall be provided to the student in accordance with the student's needs and the timeline for which the school district shall submit evidence to the State Board of Education to demonstrate compliance with the hearing officer's decision in the event that the decision orders the school district to undertake corrective action. The hearing officer shall retain jurisdiction for the sole purpose of considering a request for clarification of the final decision submitted in writing by a party to the impartial hearing officer within 5 days after receipt of the decision. A copy of the request for clarification shall specify the portions of the decision for which clarification is sought and shall be mailed to all parties of record and to the State Board of Education. The request shall operate to stay implementation of those portions of the decision for which clarification is sought, pending action on the request by the hearing officer, unless the parties otherwise agree. The hearing officer shall issue a clarification of the specified portion of the decision or issue a partial or full denial of the request in writing within 10 days of receipt of the request and mail copies to all parties to whom the decision was mailed. This subsection does not permit a party to request, or authorize a hearing officer to entertain, reconsideration of the decision itself. The statute of limitations for seeking review of the decision shall be tolled from the date the request is submitted until the date the hearing officer acts upon the request. The hearing officer's decision shall be binding upon the school district and the parents unless a civil action is commenced.
    (i) Any party to an impartial due process hearing aggrieved by the final written decision of the impartial due process hearing officer shall have the right to commence a civil action with respect to the issues presented in the impartial due process hearing. That civil action shall be brought in any court of competent jurisdiction within 120 days after a copy of the decision of the impartial due process hearing officer is mailed to the party as provided in subsection (h). The civil action authorized by this subsection shall not be exclusive of any rights or causes of action otherwise available. The commencement of a civil action under this subsection shall operate as a supersedeas. In any action brought under this subsection the Court shall receive the records of the impartial due process hearing, shall hear additional evidence at the request of a party, and, basing its decision on the preponderance of the evidence, shall grant such relief as the court determines is appropriate. In any instance where a school district willfully disregards applicable regulations or statutes regarding a child covered by this Article, and which disregard has been detrimental to the child, the school district shall be liable for any reasonable attorney's fees incurred by the parent in connection with proceedings under this Section.
    (j) During the pendency of any administrative or judicial proceeding conducted pursuant to this Section, including mediation (if the school district or other public entity voluntarily agrees to participate in mediation), unless the school district and the parents or student (if at least 18 years of age or emancipated) otherwise agree, the student shall remain in his or her present educational placement and continue in his or her present eligibility status and special education and related services, if any. If mediation fails to resolve the dispute between the parties, or if the parties do not agree to use mediation, the parent (or student if 18 years of age or older or emancipated) shall have 10 days after the mediation concludes, or after a party declines to use mediation, to file a request for a due process hearing in order to continue to invoke the "stay-put" provisions of this subsection (j). If applying for initial admission to the school district, the student shall, with the consent of the parents (if the student is not at least 18 years of age or emancipated), be placed in the school district program until all such proceedings have been completed. The costs for any special education and related services or placement incurred following 60 school days after the initial request for evaluation shall be borne by the school district if the services or placement is in accordance with the final determination as to the special education and related services or placement that must be provided to the child, provided that during that 60-day period there have been no delays caused by the child's parent. The requirements and procedures of this subsection (j) shall be included in the uniform notices developed by the State Superintendent under subsection (g) of Section 14-8.02 of this Code.
    (k) Whenever the parents of a child of the type described in Section 14-1.02 are not known or are unavailable or the child is a youth in care as defined in Section 4d of the Children and Family Services Act, a person shall be assigned to serve as surrogate parent for the child in matters relating to the identification, evaluation, and educational placement of the child and the provision of a free appropriate public education to the child. Persons shall be assigned as surrogate parents by the State Superintendent of Education. The State Board of Education shall promulgate rules and regulations establishing qualifications of those persons and their responsibilities and the procedures to be followed in making assignments of persons as surrogate parents. Surrogate parents shall not be employees of the school district, an agency created by joint agreement under Section 10-22.31, an agency involved in the education or care of the student, or the State Board of Education. Services of any person assigned as surrogate parent shall terminate if the parent becomes available unless otherwise requested by the parents. The assignment of a person as surrogate parent at no time supersedes, terminates, or suspends the parents' legal authority relative to the child. Any person participating in good faith as surrogate parent on behalf of the child before school officials or a hearing officer shall have immunity from civil or criminal liability that otherwise might result by reason of that participation, except in cases of willful and wanton misconduct.
    (l) At all stages of the hearing, the hearing officer shall require that interpreters be made available by the school district for persons who are deaf or for persons whose normally spoken language is other than English.
    (m) If any provision of this Section or its application to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity of that provision or application does not affect other provisions or applications of the Section that can be given effect without the invalid application or provision, and to this end the provisions of this Section are severable, unless otherwise provided by this Section.

(hereafter IDEA).
    (c) An expedited hearing may be requested by:

    (d) A school district shall make a request in writing to the State Board of Education and promptly mail a copy of the request to the parents or student (if at least 18 years of age or emancipated) at the parents' or student's last known address. A request made by the parent or student (if at least 18 years of age or emancipated) shall be made in writing to the superintendent of the school district in which the student resides, who shall forward the request to the State Board of Education within one business day of receipt of the request.

Also, the documentation shall include written statements of (1) whether the district is represented by legal counsel or intends to retain legal counsel; (2) the matters the district believes to be in dispute in the case and the specific relief being sought; and (3) the names of all witnesses the district intends to call to testify at the hearing.
    (f) An expedited hearing requested by the parent or student (if at least 18 years of age or emancipated) to challenge the removal of the student from his or her current placement to an interim alternative educational setting or a manifestation determination made by the district as described in IDEA shall include a written statement as to the reason the parent believes that the action taken by the district is not supported by substantial evidence and all relevant documentation in the parent's possession. Also, the documentation shall include written statements of (1) whether the parent is represented by legal counsel or intends to retain legal counsel; (2) the matters the parent believes to be in dispute in the case and the specific relief being sought; and (3) the names of all witnesses the parent intends to call to testify at the hearing.
    (g) Except as otherwise described in this subsection (g), the school district shall be required to convene the resolution meeting described in subsection (g-20) of Section 14-8.02a of this Code unless the parties choose to utilize mediation in place of the resolution meeting or waive the resolution meeting in accordance with procedures described in subsection (g-30) of Section 14-8.02a of this Code. The resolution meeting shall be convened within 7 days after the date that the expedited hearing request is received by the district.
    (h) The hearing officer shall not initiate or participate in any ex parte communications with the parties, except to arrange the date, time, and location of the expedited hearing. The hearing officer shall contact the parties within 5 days after appointment and set a hearing date which shall be no earlier than 15 calendar days following the school district's receipt of the expedited hearing request or upon completion of the resolution meeting, if earlier, and no later than 20 school days after receipt of the expedited hearing request. The hearing officer shall set a date no less than 2 business days prior to the date of the expedited hearing for the parties to exchange documentation and a list of witnesses. The non-requesting party shall not be required to submit a written response to the expedited hearing request. The parties may request mediation. The mediation shall not delay the timeline set by the hearing officer for conducting the expedited hearing. The length of the hearing shall not exceed 2 days unless good cause is shown. Good cause shall be determined by the hearing officer in his or her sole discretion and may include the unavailability of a party or witness to attend the scheduled hearing.
    (i) Any party to the hearing shall have the right to (1) be represented by counsel and be accompanied and advised by individuals with special knowledge or training with respect to the problems of children with disabilities, at the party's own expense; (2) present evidence and confront and cross-examine witnesses; (3) move for the exclusion of witnesses from the hearing until they are called to testify, provided, however, that this provision may not be invoked to exclude the individual designated by a party to assist that party or its representative in the presentation of the case; (4) in accord with the provisions of subsection (g-55) of Section 14-8.02a, obtain a written or electronic verbatim record of the proceedings; and (5) obtain a written decision, including findings of fact and conclusions of law, within 10 school days after the conclusion of the hearing.
    (j) The State Board of Education and the school district shall share equally the costs of providing a written or electronic verbatim record of the proceedings. Any party may request that the hearing officer issue a subpoena to compel the testimony of witnesses or the production of documents relevant to the resolution of the hearing. Whenever a person refuses to comply with any subpoena issued under this Section, the circuit court of the county in which that hearing is pending, on application of the impartial hearing officer or the party requesting the issuance of the subpoena, may compel compliance through the contempt powers of the court in the same manner as if the requirements of a subpoena issued by the court had been disobeyed.
    (k) The impartial hearing officer shall issue a final written decision, including findings of fact and conclusions of law, within 10 school days after the conclusion of the hearing and mail a copy of the decision to the parents or student (if the student requests the hearing), the school district, the director of special education, legal representatives of the parties, and the State Board of Education.
    (l) The hearing officer presiding over the expedited hearing shall hear only that issue or issues identified by IDEA as proper for expedited hearings, leaving all other issues to be heard under a separate request to be initiated and processed in accordance with the hearing procedures provided for in this Article and in accordance with the implementing regulations.

    Sec. 14-8.02c. Due process hearing officers.
    (a) The State Board of Education shall establish a corps of hearing officers in accordance with this Section and may, with the advice and approval of the Advisory Council on Education of Children with Disabilities, adopt rules consistent with this Section to establish the qualifications of and application process for hearing officers.
    (b) Hearing officers must, at a minimum, (i) possess a master's or doctor's degree in education or another field related to disability issues or a juris doctor degree; (ii) have knowledge of and the ability to understand the requirements of the federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, Article 14 of this Code, the implementation of rules or regulations of these federal and State statutes, and the legal interpretation of the statutes, rules, and regulations by federal and State courts; (iii) have the knowledge and ability to conduct hearings in accordance with appropriate, standard, legal practice; and (iv) have the knowledge and ability to render and write decisions in accordance with appropriate, standard, legal practice. Current employees of the State Board of Education, school districts, special education cooperatives, regional service areas or centers, regional educational cooperatives, State-operated elementary and secondary schools, or private providers of special education facilities or programs may not serve as hearing officers.
    (c) If, at any time, the State Board of Education determines that additional hearing officers are needed, the State Board of Education shall recruit hearing officer candidates who meet the criteria set forth in subsection (b) of this Section.
    (d) Candidates shall be screened by a 7-member Screening Committee consisting of the following: the Attorney General or his or her designee; the State Superintendent of Education or his or her designee; 3 members appointed by the State Superintendent of Education, one of whom shall be a parent of an individual who is or at one time was eligible to receive special education and related services in an Illinois school district, another of whom shall be a director of special education for an Illinois school district or special education joint agreement, and the other of whom shall be an adult with a disability; and 2 members appointed by the Attorney General, one of whom shall be a parent of an individual who is or at one time was eligible to receive special education and related services in an Illinois school district and the other of whom shall be an experienced special education hearing officer who is not a candidate for appointment under this Section. The chairperson of the Advisory Council on Education of Children with Disabilities or his or her designee shall serve on the Screening Committee as an ex-officio, non-voting member. Appointments and reappointments to the Screening Committee shall be for terms of 3 years. In the event that a member vacates a seat on the Screening Committee prior to the expiration of his or her term, a new member shall be appointed, shall serve the balance of the vacating member's term, and shall be eligible for subsequent reappointment. The Screening Committee shall elect a chairperson from among its voting members. Members of the Screening Committee shall serve without compensation but shall be reimbursed by the State Board of Education for their reasonable expenses. The Screening Committee shall review hearing officer applications and supporting information, interview candidates, and recommend candidates to the Advisory Council on Education of Children with Disabilities based upon objective criteria the Screening Committee develops and makes available to the public. All discussions and deliberations of the Screening Committee and Advisory Council referenced anywhere in this Section pertaining to the review of applications of hearing officer candidates, the interviewing of hearing officer candidates, the recommendation of hearing officer candidates for appointment, and the recommendation of hearing officers for reappointment are excepted from the requirements of the Open Meetings Act, pursuant to item (15) of subsection (c) of Section 2 of the Open Meetings Act.
    (e) All hearing officer candidates recommended to the Advisory Council on Education of Children with Disabilities shall successfully complete initial training, as established by the contract between the State Board of Education and the training entity, as described in subsection (f), in order to be eligible to serve as an impartial due process hearing officer. The training shall include, at a minimum, instruction in federal and State law, rules, and regulations, federal regulatory interpretations and State and federal court decisions regarding special education and relevant general educational issues, diagnostic procedures, information about disabilities, instruction on conducting effective and impartial hearings in accordance with appropriate, standard, legal practice (including without limitation the handling of amended requests), and instruction in rendering and writing hearing decisions in accordance with appropriate, standard, legal practice. The training must be conducted in an unbiased manner by educational and legal experts, including qualified individuals from outside the public educational system. Upon the completion of the initial training, the Advisory Council on Education of Children with Disabilities, applying objective selection criteria it has developed and made available to the public, shall go into executive session and select the number of hearing officers deemed necessary by the State Board of Education from those candidates who have successfully completed the initial training. Upon selecting the candidates, the Advisory Council shall forward its recommendations to the State Superintendent of Education for final selection. The hearing officers appointed by the State Superintendent of Education shall serve an initial term of one year, subject to any earlier permissible termination by the State Board of Education.
    (f) The State Board of Education shall, through a competitive application process, enter into a contract with an outside entity to establish and conduct mandatory training programs for hearing officers. The State Board of Education shall also, through a competitive application process, enter into a contract with an outside entity, other than the entity providing mandatory training, to conduct an annual evaluation of each hearing officer and to investigate complaints against hearing officers, in accordance with procedures established by the State Board of Education in consultation with the Screening Committee. The invitation for applications shall set forth minimum qualifications for eligible applicants. Each contract under this subsection (f) may be renewed on an annual basis, subject to appropriation. The State Board of Education shall conduct a new competitive application process at least once every 3 years after the initial contract is granted. The Screening Committee shall review the training proposals and evaluation and investigation proposals and forward them, with recommendations in rank order, to the State Board of Education.
    (g) The evaluation and investigation entity described in subsection (f) of this Section shall conduct an annual written evaluation of each hearing officer and provide the evaluation to the Screening Committee for its consideration in the reappointment process. The evaluation shall include a review of written decisions and any communications regarding a hearing officer's conduct and performance by participants in impartial due process hearings and their representatives. Each hearing officer shall be provided with a copy of his or her written evaluation report and shall have an opportunity, within 30 days after receipt, to review the evaluation with the evaluation and investigation entity and submit written comments. The annual evaluation of each hearing officer, along with the hearing officer's written comments, if any, shall be submitted to the Screening Committee for consideration no later than April 1 of each calendar year. The Screening Committee, based on objective criteria and any evaluation reports prepared by the training entity, shall, on an annual basis, recommend whether the hearing officer should be reappointed for a one-year term and shall forward its recommendations to the Advisory Council on Education of Children with Disabilities. The Advisory Council shall go into executive session and shall review the recommendations of the Screening Committee for the purpose of either ratifying or rejecting the recommendations of the Screening Committee. The Advisory Council shall then forward its list of ratified and rejected appointees to the State Superintendent of Education, who shall determine the final selection of hearing officers for reappointment. Each reappointed hearing officer shall serve a term of one year, subject to any earlier permissible termination by the State Board of Education.
    (h) Hearing officers shall receive a base annual stipend and per diem allowance for each hearing at a rate established by the State Board of Education. The State Board of Education shall provide hearing officers with access to relevant court decisions, impartial hearing officer decisions with child-specific identifying information deleted, statutory and regulatory changes, and federal regulatory interpretations. The State Board of Education shall index and maintain a reporting system of impartial due process hearing decisions and shall make these decisions available for review by the public after deleting child-specific identifying information.
    (i) A hearing officer may be terminated by the State Board of Education for just cause if, after written notice is provided to the hearing officer, appropriate timely corrective action is not taken. For purposes of this subsection (i), just cause shall be (1) the failure or refusal to accept assigned cases without good cause; (2) the failure or refusal to fulfill his or her duties as a hearing officer in a timely manner; (3) consistent disregard for applicable laws and rules in the conduct of hearings; (4) consistent failure to conduct himself or herself in a patient, dignified, and courteous manner to parties, witnesses, counsel, and other participants in hearings; (5) the failure to accord parties or their representatives a full and fair opportunity to be heard in matters coming before him or her; (6) violating applicable laws regarding privacy and confidentiality of records or information; (7) manifesting, by words or conduct, bias or prejudice based upon race, sex, religion, disability, or national origin; (8) failure to recuse himself or herself from a hearing in which he or she has a personal, professional, or financial conflict of interest that he or she knew or should have known existed at any time prior to or during the hearing; (9) conviction in any jurisdiction of any felony or of a misdemeanor involving moral turpitude; or (10) falsification of a material fact on his or her application to serve as a hearing officer. In addition, a hearing officer who, as a result of events occurring after appointment, no longer meets the minimum requirements set forth in this Section, shall be disqualified to complete the balance of his or her term.

    Sec. 14-8.02f. Individualized education program meeting protections.
    (a) (Blank).
    (b) This subsection (b) applies only to a school district organized under Article 34. No later than 10 calendar days prior to a child's individualized education program meeting or as soon as possible if a meeting is scheduled within 10 calendar days with written parental consent, the school board or school personnel must provide the child's parent or guardian with a written notification of the services that require a specific data collection procedure from the school district for services related to the child's individualized education program. The notification must indicate, with a checkbox, whether specific data has been collected for the child's individualized education program services. For purposes of this subsection (b), individualized education program services must include, but are not limited to, paraprofessional support, an extended school year, transportation, therapeutic day school, and services for specific learning disabilities.
    (c) Beginning on July 1, 2020, no later than 3 school days prior to a meeting to determine a child's eligibility for special education and related services or to review a child's individualized education program, or as soon as possible if an individualized education program meeting is scheduled within 3 school days with the written consent of the child's parent or guardian, the local education agency must provide the child's parent or guardian copies of all written material that will be considered by the individualized education program team at the meeting so that the parent or guardian may participate in the meeting as a fully-informed team member. The parent or guardian shall have the option of choosing from the available methods of delivery, which must include regular mail and picking up the materials at school. For a meeting to determine the child's eligibility for special education, the written material must include all evaluations and collected data that will be considered at the meeting. For a child who is already eligible for special education and related services, the written material must include a copy of all individualized education program components that will be discussed by the individualized education program team, other than the components related to the educational and related service minutes proposed for the child and the child's placement. Parents shall also be informed of their right to review and copy their child's school student records prior to any special education eligibility or individualized education program review meeting, subject to the requirements of applicable federal and State law.
    (d) Local education agencies must make logs that record the delivery of related services administered under the child's individualized education program and the minutes of each type of related service that has been administered available to the child's parent or guardian at any time upon request of the child's parent or guardian. For purposes of this subsection (d), related services for which a log must be made are: speech and language services, occupational therapy services, physical therapy services, school social work services, school counseling services, school psychology services, and school nursing services. The local education agency must inform the child's parent or guardian within 20 school days from the beginning of the school year or upon establishment of an individualized education program of his or her ability to request those related service logs.
    (d-5) If, at a meeting to develop or revise a child's individualized education program, the individualized education program team determines that a certain service is required in order for the child to receive a free, appropriate public education and that service is not implemented within 10 school days after the service was to be initiated as set forth by the child's individualized education program, then the local education agency shall provide the child's parent or guardian with written notification that the service has not yet been implemented. The notification must be provided to the child's parent or guardian within 3 school days of the local education agency's non-compliance with the child's individualized education program and must inform the parent or guardian about the school district's procedures for requesting compensatory services. In this subsection (d-5), "school days" does not include days where a child is absent from school for reasons unrelated to a lack of individualized education program services or when the service is available, but the child is unavailable.
    (e) The State Board of Education may create a telephone hotline to address complaints regarding the special education services or lack of special education services of a school district subject to this Section. If a hotline is created, it must be available to all students enrolled in the school district, parents or guardians of those students, and school personnel. If a hotline is created, any complaints received through the hotline must be registered and recorded with the State Board's monitor of special education policies. No student, parent or guardian, or member of school personnel may be retaliated against for submitting a complaint through a telephone hotline created by the State Board under this subsection (e).
    (f) A school district subject to this Section may not use any measure that would prevent or delay an individualized education program team from adding a service to the program or create a time restriction in which a service is prohibited from being added to the program. The school district may not build functions into its computer software that would remove any services from a student's individualized education program without the approval of the program team and may not prohibit the program team from adding a service to the program.

    Sec. 14-8.02h. Response to scientific, research-based intervention.
    (a) In this Section, "response to scientific, research-based intervention" or "multi-tiered system of support" means a tiered process of appropriate instruction and support that utilizes differentiated instructional strategies for students, provides students with an evidence-based curriculum and interventions aligned with State standards, continuously monitors student performance using scientific, research-based progress monitoring instruments, and makes data-driven educational decisions based on a student's response to the interventions. Response to scientific, research-based intervention or a multi-tiered system of support uses a problem-solving method to define the problem, analyzes the problem using data to determine why there is a discrepancy between what is expected and what is occurring, establishes one or more student performance goals, develops an intervention plan to address the performance goals, and delineates how the student's progress will be monitored and how implementation integrity will be ensured.
    (b) (Blank).
    (c) The response to scientific, research-based intervention or a multi-tiered system of support process should use a collaborative team approach and include the engagement of and regular communication with the child's parent or guardian. The parent or guardian of a child shall be provided with written notice of the school district's use of scientific, research-based intervention or a multi-tiered system of support for the child and may be part of the collaborative team approach at the discretion of the school district. The parent or guardian shall be provided all data collected and reviewed by the school district with regard to the child in the scientific, research-based intervention or multi-tiered system of support process. The State Board of Education may provide guidance to school districts and identify available resources related to facilitating parent or guardian engagement in the response to scientific, research-based intervention or a multi-tiered system of support process.
    (d) Nothing in this Section affects the responsibility of a school district to identify, locate, and evaluate children with disabilities who are in need of special education services in accordance with the federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, this Code, or any applicable federal or State rules.

    Sec. 14-8.03. Transition services.
    (a) For purposes of this Section, "transition services" means a coordinated set of activities for a child with a disability that (i) is designed to be within a results-oriented process that is focused on improving the academic and functional achievement of the child with a disability to facilitate the child's movement from school to post-school activities, including post-secondary education, vocational education, integrated employment (including supported employment), continuing and adult education, adult services, independent living, or community participation; (ii) is based on the individual child's needs, taking into account the child's strengths, preferences, and interests; and (iii) includes instruction, related services, community experiences, the development of employment and other post-school adult living objectives, and, if appropriate, acquisition of daily living skills, benefits planning, work incentives education, and the provision of a functional vocational evaluation. Transition services for a child with a disability may be special education, if provided as specially designed instruction, or a related service if required to assist a child with a disability to benefit from special education.
    (a-5) Beginning no later than the first individualized education plan (IEP) in effect when the student turns age 14 1/2 (or younger if determined appropriate by the IEP Team) and updated annually thereafter, the IEP must include (i) measurable post-secondary goals based upon age-appropriate transition assessments and other information available regarding the student that are related to training, education, employment, and independent living skills and (ii) the transition services needed to assist the student in reaching those goals, including courses of study.
    (b) Transition planning must be conducted as part of the IEP process and must be governed by the procedures applicable to the development, review, and revision of the IEP, including notices to the parents and student, parent and student participation, and annual review. To appropriately assess and develop IEP transition goals and transition services for a child with a disability, additional participants may be necessary and may be invited by the school district, parent, or student to participate in the transition planning process. Additional participants may include without limitation a representative from the Department of Human Services or another State agency, a case coordinator, or persons representing other public or community agencies or services, such as adult service providers or public community colleges. The IEP shall identify each person responsible for coordinating and delivering transition services. If the IEP team determines that the student requires transition services from a public or private entity outside of the school district, the IEP team shall identify potential outside resources, assign one or more IEP team members to contact the appropriate outside entities, make the necessary referrals, provide any information and documents necessary to complete the referral, follow up with the entity to ensure that the student has been successfully linked to the entity, and monitor the student's progress to determine if the student's IEP transition goals and benchmarks are being met. The student's IEP shall indicate one or more specific time periods during the school year when the IEP team shall review the services provided by the outside entity and the student's progress in such activities. The public school's responsibility for delivering educational services does not extend beyond the time the student leaves school or when the student's eligibility ends due to age under this Article.
    (c) A school district shall submit annually a summary of each eligible student's IEP transition goals and transition services resulting from the IEP Team meeting to the appropriate local Transition Planning Committee. If students with disabilities who are ineligible for special education services request transition services, local public school districts shall assist those students by identifying post-secondary school goals, delivering appropriate education services, and coordinating with other agencies and services for assistance.

    Sec. 14-8.05. Behavioral intervention.
    (a) The General Assembly finds and declares that principals and teachers of students with disabilities require training and guidance that provide ways for working successfully with children who have difficulties conforming to acceptable behavioral patterns in order to provide an environment in which learning can occur. It is the intent of the General Assembly:
        (1) That when behavioral interventions are used, they
    	
be used in consideration of the pupil's physical freedom and social interaction, and be administered in a manner that respects human dignity and personal privacy and that ensures a pupil's right to placement in the least restrictive educational environment.
        (2) That behavioral management plans be developed and
    	
used, to the extent possible, in a consistent manner when a local educational agency has placed the pupil in a day or residential setting for education purposes.
        (3) That a statewide study be conducted of the use of
    	
behavioral interventions with students with disabilities receiving special education and related services.
        (4) That training programs be developed and
    	
implemented in institutions of higher education that train teachers, and that in-service training programs be made available as necessary in school districts, in educational service centers, and by regional superintendents of schools to assure that adequately trained staff are available to work effectively with the behavioral intervention needs of students with disabilities.
    (b) On or before September 30, 1993, the State Superintendent of Education shall conduct a statewide study of the use of behavioral interventions with students with disabilities receiving special education and related services. The study shall include, but not necessarily be limited to identification of the frequency in the use of behavioral interventions; the number of districts with policies in place for working with children exhibiting continuous serious behavioral problems; how policies, rules, or regulations within districts differ between emergency and routine behavioral interventions commonly practiced; the nature and extent of costs for training provided to personnel for implementing a program of nonaversive behavioral interventions; and the nature and extent of costs for training provided to parents of students with disabilities who would be receiving behavioral interventions. The scope of the study shall be developed by the State Board of Education, in consultation with individuals and groups representing parents, teachers, administrators, and advocates. On or before June 30, 1994, the State Board of Education shall issue guidelines based on the study's findings.

The State Board of Education shall maintain, subject to appropriations for such purpose, the Service Resource Center for children and adolescents through the age of 21 who are deaf or hard-of-hearing and have an emotional or behavioral disorder. For the purpose of this Section, "children and adolescents who are deaf or hard-of-hearing and have an emotional or behavioral disorder" have an auditory impairment that is serious enough to warrant an array of special services and special education programs in order to assist both educationally and socially and the behavior is seriously disruptive and unacceptable to peers, educational staff, and persons in the community, or presents a danger to self or others.
    The State Board shall operate or contract for the operation of the Illinois Service Resource Center for children and adolescents through the age of 21 who are deaf or hard-of-hearing and have an emotional or behavioral disorder. The Illinois Service Resource Center shall function as the initial point of contact for students, parents, and professionals. All existing and future services shall be coordinated through the Center.
    The Illinois Service Resource Center shall:
    (a) Develop and maintain a directory of public and private resources, including crisis intervention.

    Sec. 14-13.01. Reimbursement payable by State; amounts for personnel and transportation.
    (a) Through fiscal year 2017, for staff working on behalf of children who have not been identified as eligible for special education and for eligible children with physical disabilities, including all eligible children whose placement has been determined under Section 14-8.02 in hospital or home instruction, 1/2 of the teacher's salary but not more than $1,000 annually per child or $9,000 per teacher, whichever is less.
    (a-5) A child qualifies for home or hospital instruction if it is anticipated that, due to a medical condition, the child will be unable to attend school, and instead must be instructed at home or in the hospital, for a period of 2 or more consecutive weeks or on an ongoing intermittent basis. For purposes of this Section, "ongoing intermittent basis" means that the child's medical condition is of such a nature or severity that it is anticipated that the child will be absent from school due to the medical condition for periods of at least 2 days at a time multiple times during the school year totaling at least 10 days or more of absences. There shall be no requirement that a child be absent from school a minimum number of days before the child qualifies for home or hospital instruction. In order to establish eligibility for home or hospital services, a student's parent or guardian must submit to the child's school district of residence a written statement from a physician licensed to practice medicine in all of its branches, a licensed physician assistant, or a licensed advanced practice registered nurse stating the existence of such medical condition, the impact on the child's ability to participate in education, and the anticipated duration or nature of the child's absence from school. Home or hospital instruction may commence upon receipt of a written physician's, physician assistant's, or advanced practice registered nurse's statement in accordance with this Section, but instruction shall commence not later than 5 school days after the school district receives the physician's, physician assistant's, or advanced practice registered nurse's statement. Special education and related services required by the child's IEP or services and accommodations required by the child's federal Section 504 plan must be implemented as part of the child's home or hospital instruction, unless the IEP team or federal Section 504 plan team determines that modifications are necessary during the home or hospital instruction due to the child's condition.
    (a-10) Through fiscal year 2017, eligible children to be included in any reimbursement under this paragraph must regularly receive a minimum of one hour of instruction each school day, or in lieu thereof of a minimum of 5 hours of instruction in each school week in order to qualify for full reimbursement under this Section. If the attending physician, physician assistant, or advanced practice registered nurse for such a child has certified that the child should not receive as many as 5 hours of instruction in a school week, however, reimbursement under this paragraph on account of that child shall be computed proportionate to the actual hours of instruction per week for that child divided by 5.
    (a-15) The State Board of Education shall establish rules governing the required qualifications of staff providing home or hospital instruction.
    (b) For children described in Section 14-1.02, 80% of the cost of transportation approved as a related service in the Individualized Education Program for each student in order to take advantage of special educational facilities. Transportation costs shall be determined in the same fashion as provided in Section 29-5 of this Code. For purposes of this subsection (b), the dates for processing claims specified in Section 29-5 shall apply.
    (c) Through fiscal year 2017, for each qualified worker, the annual sum of $9,000.
    (d) Through fiscal year 2017, for one full-time qualified director of the special education program of each school district which maintains a fully approved program of special education, the annual sum of $9,000. Districts participating in a joint agreement special education program shall not receive such reimbursement if reimbursement is made for a director of the joint agreement program.
    (e) (Blank).
    (f) (Blank).
    (g) Through fiscal year 2017, for readers working with blind or partially seeing children, 1/2 of their salary but not more than $400 annually per child. Readers may be employed to assist such children and shall not be required to be certified but prior to employment shall meet standards set up by the State Board of Education.
    (h) Through fiscal year 2017, for non-certified employees, as defined by rules promulgated by the State Board of Education, who deliver services to students with IEPs, 1/2 of the salary paid or $3,500 per employee, whichever is less.
    (i) The State Board of Education shall set standards and prescribe rules for determining the allocation of reimbursement under this section on less than a full time basis and for less than a school year.
    When any school district eligible for reimbursement under this Section operates a school or program approved by the State Superintendent of Education for a number of days in excess of the adopted school calendar but not to exceed 235 school days, such reimbursement shall be increased by 1/180 of the amount or rate paid hereunder for each day such school is operated in excess of 180 days per calendar year.
    Notwithstanding any other provision of law, any school district receiving a payment under this Section or under Section 14-7.02, 14-7.02b, or 29-5 of this Code may classify all or a portion of the funds that it receives in a particular fiscal year or from evidence-based funding pursuant to Section 18-8.15 of this Code as funds received in connection with any funding program for which it is entitled to receive funds from the State in that fiscal year (including, without limitation, any funding program referenced in this Section), regardless of the source or timing of the receipt. The district may not classify more funds as funds received in connection with the funding program than the district is entitled to receive in that fiscal year for that program. Any classification by a district must be made by a resolution of its board of education. The resolution must identify the amount of any payments or evidence-based funding to be classified under this paragraph and must specify the funding program to which the funds are to be treated as received in connection therewith. This resolution is controlling as to the classification of funds referenced therein. A certified copy of the resolution must be sent to the State Superintendent of Education. The resolution shall still take effect even though a copy of the resolution has not been sent to the State Superintendent of Education in a timely manner. No classification under this paragraph by a district shall affect the total amount or timing of money the district is entitled to receive under this Code. No classification under this paragraph by a district shall in any way relieve the district from or affect any requirements that otherwise would apply with respect to that funding program, including any accounting of funds by source, reporting expenditures by original source and purpose, reporting requirements, or requirements of providing services.
    No funding shall be provided to school districts under this Section after fiscal year 2017. In fiscal year 2018 and each fiscal year thereafter, all funding received by a school district from the State pursuant to Section 18-8.15 of this Code that is attributable to personnel reimbursements for special education pupils must be used for special education services authorized under this Code.

    Sec. 14-16. Participation in graduation ceremony.
    (a) This Section may be referred to as Brittany's Law. The General Assembly finds the following:
        (1) Each year, school districts across this State
    	
celebrate their students' accomplishments through graduation ceremonies at which high school diplomas are bestowed upon students who have completed their high school requirements.
        (2) There are children with disabilities in this
    	
State who have finished 4 years of high school, but whose individualized education programs prescribe the continuation of special education, transition planning, transition services, or related services beyond the completion of 4 years of high school.
        (3) It is well-established that the awarding of a
    	
high school diploma to and the high school graduation of a child with a disability is tantamount to the termination of eligibility for special education and related services for the student under applicable federal law.
        (4) Many children with disabilities who will
    	
continue their public education in accordance with their individualized education programs after finishing 4 years of high school wish to celebrate their accomplishments by participating in a graduation ceremony with their classmates.
        (5) The opportunity for classmates with disabilities
    	
and those without disabilities to celebrate their accomplishments together only occurs once, and the opportunity to celebrate the receipt of a diploma several years after one's classmates have graduated diminishes the experience for students whose age peers have left high school several years earlier.
    (b) Beginning March 1, 2005, each school district that operates a high school must have a policy and procedures that allow a child with a disability who will have completed 4 years of high school at the end of a school year to participate in the graduation ceremony of the student's high school graduating class and receive a certificate of completion if the student's individualized education program prescribes special education, transition planning, transition services, or related services beyond the student's 4 years of high school. The policy and procedures must require timely and meaningful written notice to children with disabilities and their parents or guardians about the school district's policy and procedures adopted in accordance with this Section.
    (c) The State Board of Education shall monitor and enforce compliance with the provisions of this Section and is authorized to adopt rules for that purpose.

    Sec. 14A-32. Accelerated placement; school district responsibilities.
    (a) Each school district shall have a policy that allows for accelerated placement that includes or incorporates by reference the following components:
        (1) a provision that provides that participation in
    	
accelerated placement is not limited to those children who have been identified as gifted and talented, but rather is open to all children who demonstrate high ability and who may benefit from accelerated placement;
        (2) a fair and equitable decision-making process that
    	
involves multiple persons and includes a student's parents or guardians;
        (3) procedures for notifying parents or guardians of
    	
a child of a decision affecting that child's participation in an accelerated placement program; and
        (4) an assessment process that includes multiple
    	
valid, reliable indicators.
    (a-5) By no later than the beginning of the 2023-2024 school year, a school district's accelerated placement policy shall allow for the automatic enrollment, in the following school term, of a student into the next most rigorous level of advanced coursework offered by the high school if the student meets or exceeds State standards in English language arts, mathematics, or science on a State assessment administered under Section 2-3.64a-5 as follows:
        (1) A student who meets or exceeds State standards in
    	
English language arts shall be automatically enrolled into the next most rigorous level of advanced coursework in English, social studies, humanities, or related subjects.
        (2) A student who meets or exceeds State standards in
    	
mathematics shall be automatically enrolled into the next most rigorous level of advanced coursework in mathematics.

For other high school grades, the results from a locally selected, nationally normed assessment may be used instead of the State assessment if those results are the most recent.
    A school district must provide the parent or guardian of a student eligible for automatic enrollment under this subsection (a-5) with the option to instead have the student enroll in alternative coursework that better aligns with the student's postsecondary education or career goals.
    Nothing in this subsection (a-5) may be interpreted to preclude other students from enrolling in advanced coursework per the policy of a school district.
    (b) Further, a school district's accelerated placement policy may include or incorporate by reference, but need not be limited to, the following components:
        (1) procedures for annually informing the community
    	
at-large, including parents or guardians, community-based organizations, and providers of out-of-school programs, about the accelerated placement program and the methods used for the identification of children eligible for accelerated placement, including strategies to reach groups of students and families who have been historically underrepresented in accelerated placement programs and advanced coursework;
        (2) a process for referral that allows for multiple
    	
referrers, including a child's parents or guardians; other referrers may include licensed education professionals, the child, with the written consent of a parent or guardian, a peer, through a licensed education professional who has knowledge of the referred child's abilities, or, in case of possible early entrance, a preschool educator, pediatrician, or psychologist who knows the child;
        (3) a provision that provides that children
    	
participating in an accelerated placement program and their parents or guardians will be provided a written plan detailing the type of acceleration the child will receive and strategies to support the child;
        (4) procedures to provide support and promote success
    	
for students who are newly enrolled in an accelerated placement program; and
        (5) a process for the school district to review and
    	
utilize disaggregated data on participation in an accelerated placement program to address gaps among demographic groups in accelerated placement opportunities.
    (c) The State Board of Education shall adopt rules to determine data to be collected and disaggregated by demographic group regarding accelerated placement, including the rates of students who participate in and successfully complete advanced coursework, and a method of making the information available to the public.
    (d) On or before November 1, 2022, following a review of disaggregated data on the participation and successful completion rates of students enrolled in an accelerated placement program, each school district shall develop a plan to expand access to its accelerated placement program and to ensure the teaching capacity necessary to meet the increased demand.

ARTICLE 14C. TRANSITIONAL BILINGUAL EDUCATION

    (105 ILCS 5/14C-1) (from Ch. 122, par. 14C-1)
    Sec. 14C-1. The General Assembly finds that there are large numbers of children in this State who come from environments where the primary language is other than English. Experience has shown that public school classes in which instruction is given only in English are often inadequate for the education of children whose native tongue is another language. The General Assembly believes that a program of transitional bilingual education can meet the needs of these children and facilitate their integration into the regular public school curriculum. Therefore, pursuant to the policy of this State to ensure equal educational opportunity to every child, and in recognition of the educational needs of English learners, it is the purpose of this Act to provide for the establishment of transitional bilingual education programs in the public schools, to provide supplemental financial assistance through fiscal year 2017 to help local school districts meet the extra costs of such programs, and to allow this State through the State Board of Education to directly or indirectly provide technical assistance and professional development to support transitional bilingual education or a transitional program of instruction statewide through contractual services by a not-for-profit entity for technical assistance, professional development, and other support to school districts and educators for services for English learner pupils. In no case may aggregate funding for contractual services by a not-for-profit entity for support to school districts and educators for services for English learner pupils be less than the aggregate amount expended for such purposes in Fiscal Year 2017. Not-for-profit entities providing support to school districts and educators for services for English learner pupils must have experience providing those services in a school district having a population exceeding 500,000; one or more school districts in any of the counties of Lake, McHenry, DuPage, Kane, and Will; and one or more school districts elsewhere in this State. Funding for not-for-profit entities providing support to school districts and educators for services for English learner pupils may be increased subject to an agreement with the State Board of Education. Funding for not-for-profit entities providing support to school districts and educators for services for English learner pupils shall come from funds allocated pursuant to Section 18-8.15 of this Code.

Each school district shall ascertain, not later than the first day of March, under regulations prescribed by the State Board, the number of English learners within the school district, and shall classify them according to the language of which they possess a primary speaking ability, and their grade level, age or achievement level.
    When, at the beginning of any school year, there is within an attendance center of a school district, not including children who are enrolled in existing private school systems, 20 or more English learners in any such language classification, the school district shall establish, for each classification, a program in transitional bilingual education for the children therein. A school district may establish a program in transitional bilingual education with respect to any classification with less than 20 children therein, but should a school district decide not to establish such a program, the school district shall provide a locally determined transitional program of instruction which, based upon an individual student language assessment, provides content area instruction in a language other than English to the extent necessary to ensure that each student can benefit from educational instruction and achieve an early and effective transition into the regular school curriculum.
    Every school-age English learner not enrolled in existing private school systems shall be enrolled and participate in the program in transitional bilingual education established for the classification to which he belongs by the school district in which he resides for a period of 3 years or until such time as he achieves a level of English language skills which will enable him to perform successfully in classes in which instruction is given only in English, whichever shall first occur.
    An English learner enrolled in a program in transitional bilingual education may, in the discretion of the school district and subject to the approval of the child's parent or legal guardian, continue in that program for a period longer than 3 years.
    An examination in the oral language (listening and speaking), reading, and writing of English, as prescribed by the State Board, shall be administered annually to all English learners enrolled and participating in a program in transitional bilingual education. No school district shall transfer an English learner out of a program in transitional bilingual education prior to his third year of enrollment therein unless the parents of the child approve the transfer in writing, and unless the child has received a score on said examination which, in the determination of the State Board, reflects a level of English language skills appropriate to his or her grade level.
    If later evidence suggests that a child so transferred is still disabled by an inadequate command of English, he may be re-enrolled in the program for a length of time equal to that which remained at the time he was transferred.

    (105 ILCS 5/17-1) (from Ch. 122, par. 17-1)
    Sec. 17-1. Annual budget. The board of education of each school district under 500,000 inhabitants shall, within or before the first quarter of each fiscal year, adopt and file with the State Board of Education an annual balanced budget which it deems necessary to defray all necessary expenses and liabilities of the district, and in such annual budget shall specify the objects and purposes of each item and amount needed for each object or purpose.
    The budget shall be entered upon a School District Budget form prepared and provided by the State Board of Education and therein shall contain a statement of the cash on hand at the beginning of the fiscal year, an estimate of the cash expected to be received during such fiscal year from all sources, an estimate of the expenditures contemplated for such fiscal year, and a statement of the estimated cash expected to be on hand at the end of such year. The estimate of taxes to be received may be based upon the amount of actual cash receipts that may reasonably be expected by the district during such fiscal year, estimated from the experience of the district in prior years and with due regard for other circumstances that may substantially affect such receipts. Nothing in this Section shall be construed as requiring any district to change or preventing any district from changing from a cash basis of financing to a surplus or deficit basis of financing; or as requiring any district to change or preventing any district from changing its system of accounting. The budget shall conform to the requirements adopted by the State Board of Education pursuant to Section 2-3.28 of this Code.
    To the extent that a school district's budget is not balanced, the district shall also adopt and file with the State Board of Education a deficit reduction plan to balance the district's budget within 3 years. The deficit reduction plan must be filed at the same time as the budget, but the State Superintendent of Education may extend this deadline if the situation warrants.
    If, as the result of an audit performed in compliance with Section 3-7 of this Code, the resulting Annual Financial Report required to be submitted pursuant to Section 3-15.1 of this Code reflects a deficit as defined for purposes of the preceding paragraph, then the district shall, within 30 days after acceptance of such audit report, submit a deficit reduction plan.
    The board of education of each district shall fix a fiscal year therefor. If the beginning of the fiscal year of a district is subsequent to the time that the tax levy due to be made in such fiscal year shall be made, then such annual budget shall be adopted prior to the time such tax levy shall be made. The failure by a board of education of any district to adopt an annual budget, or to comply in any respect with the provisions of this Section, shall not affect the validity of any tax levy of the district otherwise in conformity with the law. With respect to taxes levied either before, on, or after the effective date of this amendatory Act of the 91st General Assembly, (i) a tax levy is made for the fiscal year in which the levy is due to be made regardless of which fiscal year the proceeds of the levy are expended or are intended to be expended, and (ii) except as otherwise provided by law, a board of education's adoption of an annual budget in conformity with this Section is not a prerequisite to the adoption of a valid tax levy and is not a limit on the amount of the levy.
    Such budget shall be prepared in tentative form by some person or persons designated by the board, and in such tentative form shall be made conveniently available to public inspection for at least 30 days prior to final action thereon.

    Sec. 17-1.5. Limitation of administrative costs.
    (a) It is the purpose of this Section to establish limitations on the growth of administrative expenditures in order to maximize the proportion of school district resources available for the instructional program, building maintenance, and safety services for the students of each district.
    (b) Definitions. For the purposes of this Section:
    "Administrative expenditures" mean the annual expenditures of school districts properly attributable to expenditure functions defined by the rules of the State Board of Education as: 2320 (Executive Administration Services); 2330 (Special Area Administration Services); 2490 (Other Support Services - School Administration); 2510 (Direction of Business Support Services); 2570 (Internal Services); and 2610 (Direction of Central Support Services); provided, however, that "administrative expenditures" shall not include early retirement or other pension system obligations required by State law.
    "School district" means all school districts having a population of less than 500,000.
    (c) For the 1998-99 school year and each school year thereafter, each school district shall undertake budgetary and expenditure control actions so that the increase in administrative expenditures for that school year over the prior school year does not exceed 5%. School districts with administrative expenditures per pupil in the 25th percentile and below for all districts of the same type, as defined by the State Board of Education, may waive the limitation imposed under this Section for any year following a public hearing and with the affirmative vote of at least two-thirds of the members of the school board of the district. Any district waiving the limitation shall notify the State Board within 45 days of such action.
    (d) School districts shall file with the State Board of Education by November 15, 1998 and by each November 15th thereafter a one-page report that lists (i) the actual administrative expenditures for the prior year from the district's audited Annual Financial Report, and (ii) the projected administrative expenditures for the current year from the budget adopted by the school board pursuant to Section 17-1 of this Code.
    If a school district that is ineligible to waive the limitation imposed by subsection (c) of this Section by board action exceeds the limitation solely because of circumstances beyond the control of the district and the district has exhausted all available and reasonable remedies to comply with the limitation, the district may request a waiver pursuant to Section 2-3.25g. The waiver application shall specify the amount, nature, and reason for the relief requested, as well as all remedies the district has exhausted to comply with the limitation. Any emergency relief so requested shall apply only to the specific school year for which the request is made. The State Board of Education shall analyze all such waivers submitted and shall recommend that the General Assembly disapprove any such waiver requested that is not due solely to circumstances beyond the control of the district and for which the district has not exhausted all available and reasonable remedies to comply with the limitation. The State Superintendent shall have no authority to impose any sanctions pursuant to this Section for any expenditures for which a waiver has been requested until such waiver has been reviewed by the General Assembly.
    If the report and information required under this subsection (d) are not provided by the school district in a timely manner, or are subsequently determined by the State Superintendent of Education to be incomplete or inaccurate, the State Superintendent shall notify the district in writing of reporting deficiencies. The school district shall, within 60 days of the notice, address the reporting deficiencies identified.
    (e) If the State Superintendent determines that a school district has failed to comply with the administrative expenditure limitation imposed in subsection (c) of this Section, the State Superintendent shall notify the district of the violation and direct the district to undertake corrective action to bring the district's budget into compliance with the administrative expenditure limitation. The district shall, within 60 days of the notice, provide adequate assurance to the State Superintendent that appropriate corrective actions have been or will be taken. If the district fails to provide adequate assurance or fails to undertake the necessary corrective actions, the State Superintendent may impose progressive sanctions against the district that may culminate in withholding all subsequent payments of general State aid due the district under Section 18-8.05 of this Code or evidence-based funding due the district under Section 18-8.15 of this Code until the assurance is provided or the corrective actions taken.
    (f) The State Superintendent shall publish a list each year of the school districts that violate the limitation imposed by subsection (c) of this Section and a list of the districts that waive the limitation by board action as provided in subsection (c) of this Section.

    Sec. 17-2.2a. Tax for special education programs.
    (a) The school board of any district having a population of less than 500,000 inhabitants may, by proper resolution, levy an annual tax upon the value as equalized or assessed by the Department of Revenue, for special education purposes, including the purposes authorized by Section 10-22.31b as follows:

If the project is completed and, therefore, all costs have been paid for in full and there remain funds on hand, including any interest earnings thereon, from the insurance coverage, legal judgment, or settlement, then a portion of those excess funds equal to the State's share of the construction cost of the project shall be paid to the State of Illinois for deposit into the School Construction Fund or other State fund from which the construction grant was paid, and the remainder of the excess funds shall be transferred to the district's bond and interest fund for the purpose of abating taxes to pay debt service on the bonds or for defeasance of the debt or both. If no debt service remains to be paid, then the excess may be transferred to whichever fund that, as determined by the school board, is most in need of the funds.

The school board of any district having a population of less than 500,000 inhabitants may, by proper resolution, levy an annual tax of not more than .05% upon the value as equalized or assessed by the Department of Revenue for such purpose, and may accumulate such tax for not more than 5 years, for area vocational education building purposes, including the purposes authorized by Section 10-22.31b of this Act, upon condition that there are not sufficient funds available in the operations and maintenance fund of the district to pay the cost thereof. Such tax shall not be levied without prior approval of the State Superintendent of Education and prior approval by a majority of the electors voting upon the proposition at an election, the proposition having been certified by the secretary of the school board to the proper election authorities for submission to the electorate in accordance with the general election law.
    When the school boards of two or more districts enter into a joint agreement for an area vocational education building program under Section 10-22.31b their agreement may provide, or may be amended to provide, that the question of the levy of the tax authorized by this Section shall be certified to the proper election authorities, for submission to the voters of all of the participating districts in accordance with the general election law, in the same election and that the approval of that levy by a majority of the electors voting upon the proposition in the area comprised of the participating districts, considered as a whole, shall be deemed to authorize that levy in each participating district without regard to the passage or failure of the proposition in any district considered separately. However, the school board of any district may withdraw from the joint agreement by reason of the failure of the electors of that district to approve the proposed levy.

    (105 ILCS 5/17-2.11) (from Ch. 122, par. 17-2.11)
    Sec. 17-2.11. School board power to levy a tax or to borrow money and issue bonds for fire prevention, safety, energy conservation, accessibility, school security, and specified repair purposes.
    (a) Whenever, as a result of any lawful order of any agency, other than a school board, having authority to enforce any school building code applicable to any facility that houses students, or any law or regulation for the protection and safety of the environment, pursuant to the Environmental Protection Act, any school district having a population of less than 500,000 inhabitants is required to alter or reconstruct any school building or permanent, fixed equipment; the district may, by proper resolution, levy a tax for the purpose of making such alteration or reconstruction, based on a survey report by an architect or engineer licensed in this State, upon all of the taxable property of the district at the value as assessed by the Department of Revenue and at a rate not to exceed 0.05% per year for a period sufficient to finance such alteration or reconstruction, upon the following conditions:
        (1) When there are not sufficient funds available in
    	
the operations and maintenance fund of the school district, the school facility occupation tax fund of the district, or the fire prevention and safety fund of the district, as determined by the district on the basis of rules adopted by the State Board of Education, to make such alteration or reconstruction or to purchase and install such permanent, fixed equipment so ordered or determined as necessary. Appropriate school district records must be made available to the State Superintendent of Education, upon request, to confirm this insufficiency.
        (2) When a certified estimate of an architect or
    	
engineer licensed in this State stating the estimated amount necessary to make the alteration or reconstruction or to purchase and install the equipment so ordered has been secured by the school district, and the estimate has been approved by the regional superintendent of schools having jurisdiction over the district and the State Superintendent of Education. Approval must not be granted for any work that has already started without the prior express authorization of the State Superintendent of Education. If the estimate is not approved or is denied approval by the regional superintendent of schools within 3 months after the date on which it is submitted to him or her, the school board of the district may submit the estimate directly to the State Superintendent of Education for approval or denial.
    In the case of an emergency situation, where the estimated cost to effectuate emergency repairs is less than the amount specified in Section 10-20.21 of this Code, the school district may proceed with such repairs prior to approval by the State Superintendent of Education, but shall comply with the provisions of subdivision (2) of this subsection (a) as soon thereafter as may be as well as Section 10-20.21 of this Code. If the estimated cost to effectuate emergency repairs is greater than the amount specified in Section 10-20.21 of this Code, then the school district shall proceed in conformity with Section 10-20.21 of this Code and with rules established by the State Board of Education to address such situations. The rules adopted by the State Board of Education to deal with these situations shall stipulate that emergency situations must be expedited and given priority consideration. For purposes of this paragraph, an emergency is a situation that presents an imminent and continuing threat to the health and safety of students or other occupants of a facility, requires complete or partial evacuation of a building or part of a building, or consumes one or more of the 5 emergency days built into the adopted calendar of the school or schools or would otherwise be expected to cause such school or schools to fall short of the minimum school calendar requirements.
    (b) Whenever any such district determines that it is necessary for energy conservation purposes that any school building or permanent, fixed equipment should be altered or reconstructed and that such alterations or reconstruction will be made with funds not necessary for the completion of approved and recommended projects contained in any safety survey report or amendments thereto authorized by Section 2-3.12 of this Act; the district may levy a tax or issue bonds as provided in subsection (a) of this Section.
    (c) Whenever any such district determines that it is necessary for accessibility purposes and to comply with the school building code that any school building or equipment should be altered or reconstructed and that such alterations or reconstruction will be made with funds not necessary for the completion of approved and recommended projects contained in any safety survey report or amendments thereto authorized under Section 2-3.12 of this Act, the district may levy a tax or issue bonds as provided in subsection (a) of this Section.
    (d) Whenever any such district determines that it is necessary for school security purposes and the related protection and safety of pupils and school personnel that any school building or property should be altered or reconstructed or that security systems and equipment (including but not limited to intercom, early detection and warning, access control and television monitoring systems) should be purchased and installed, and that such alterations, reconstruction or purchase and installation of equipment will be made with funds not necessary for the completion of approved and recommended projects contained in any safety survey report or amendment thereto authorized by Section 2-3.12 of this Act and will deter and prevent unauthorized entry or activities upon school property by unknown or dangerous persons, assure early detection and advance warning of any such actual or attempted unauthorized entry or activities and help assure the continued safety of pupils and school staff if any such unauthorized entry or activity is attempted or occurs; the district may levy a tax or issue bonds as provided in subsection (a) of this Section.
    If such a school district determines that it is necessary for school security purposes and the related protection and safety of pupils and school staff to hire a school resource officer or that personnel costs for school counselors, mental health experts, or school resource officers are necessary and the district determines that it does not need funds for any of the other purposes set forth in this Section, then the district may levy a tax or issue bonds as provided in subsection (a).
    (e) If a school district does not need funds for other fire prevention and safety projects, including the completion of approved and recommended projects contained in any safety survey report or amendments thereto authorized by Section 2-3.12 of this Act, and it is determined after a public hearing (which is preceded by at least one published notice (i) occurring at least 7 days prior to the hearing in a newspaper of general circulation within the school district and (ii) setting forth the time, date, place, and general subject matter of the hearing) that there is a substantial, immediate, and otherwise unavoidable threat to the health, safety, or welfare of pupils due to disrepair of school sidewalks, playgrounds, parking lots, or school bus turnarounds and repairs must be made; then the district may levy a tax or issue bonds as provided in subsection (a) of this Section.
    (f) For purposes of this Section a school district may replace a school building or build additions to replace portions of a building when it is determined that the effectuation of the recommendations for the existing building will cost more than the replacement costs. Such determination shall be based on a comparison of estimated costs made by an architect or engineer licensed in the State of Illinois. The new building or addition shall be equivalent in area (square feet) and comparable in purpose and grades served and may be on the same site or another site. Such replacement may only be done upon order of the regional superintendent of schools and the approval of the State Superintendent of Education.
    (g) The filing of a certified copy of the resolution levying the tax when accompanied by the certificates of the regional superintendent of schools and State Superintendent of Education shall be the authority of the county clerk to extend such tax.
    (h) The county clerk of the county in which any school district levying a tax under the authority of this Section is located, in reducing raised levies, shall not consider any such tax as a part of the general levy for school purposes and shall not include the same in the limitation of any other tax rate which may be extended.
    Such tax shall be levied and collected in like manner as all other taxes of school districts, subject to the provisions contained in this Section.
    (i) The tax rate limit specified in this Section may be increased to .10% upon the approval of a proposition to effect such increase by a majority of the electors voting on that proposition at a regular scheduled election. Such proposition may be initiated by resolution of the school board and shall be certified by the secretary to the proper election authorities for submission in accordance with the general election law.
    (j) When taxes are levied by any school district for fire prevention, safety, energy conservation, and school security purposes as specified in this Section, and the purposes for which the taxes have been levied are accomplished and paid in full, and there remain funds on hand in the Fire Prevention and Safety Fund from the proceeds of the taxes levied, including interest earnings thereon, the school board by resolution shall use such excess and other board restricted funds, excluding bond proceeds and earnings from such proceeds, as follows:
        (1) for other authorized fire prevention, safety,
    	
energy conservation, required safety inspections, school security purposes, sampling for lead in drinking water in schools, and for repair and mitigation due to lead levels in the drinking water supply; or
        (2) for transfer to the Operations and Maintenance
    	
Fund for the purpose of abating an equal amount of operations and maintenance purposes taxes.
Notwithstanding subdivision (2) of this subsection (j) and subsection (k) of this Section, through June 30, 2021, the school board may, by proper resolution following a public hearing set by the school board or the president of the school board (that is preceded (i) by at least one published notice over the name of the clerk or secretary of the board, occurring at least 7 days and not more than 30 days prior to the hearing, in a newspaper of general circulation within the school district and (ii) by posted notice over the name of the clerk or secretary of the board, at least 48 hours before the hearing, at the principal office of the school board or at the building where the hearing is to be held if a principal office does not exist, with both notices setting forth the time, date, place, and subject matter of the hearing), transfer surplus life safety taxes and interest earnings thereon to the Operations and Maintenance Fund for building repair work.
    (k) If any transfer is made to the Operation and Maintenance Fund, the secretary of the school board shall within 30 days notify the county clerk of the amount of that transfer and direct the clerk to abate the taxes to be extended for the purposes of operations and maintenance authorized under Section 17-2 of this Act by an amount equal to such transfer.
    (l) If the proceeds from the tax levy authorized by this Section are insufficient to complete the work approved under this Section, the school board is authorized to sell bonds without referendum under the provisions of this Section in an amount that, when added to the proceeds of the tax levy authorized by this Section, will allow completion of the approved work.
    (m) Any bonds issued pursuant to this Section shall bear interest at a rate not to exceed the maximum rate authorized by law at the time of the making of the contract, shall mature within 20 years from date, and shall be signed by the president of the school board and the treasurer of the school district.
    (n) In order to authorize and issue such bonds, the school board shall adopt a resolution fixing the amount of bonds, the date thereof, the maturities thereof, rates of interest thereof, place of payment and denomination, which shall be in denominations of not less than $100 and not more than $5,000, and provide for the levy and collection of a direct annual tax upon all the taxable property in the school district sufficient to pay the principal and interest on such bonds to maturity. Upon the filing in the office of the county clerk of the county in which the school district is located of a certified copy of the resolution, it is the duty of the county clerk to extend the tax therefor in addition to and in excess of all other taxes heretofore or hereafter authorized to be levied by such school district.
    (o) After the time such bonds are issued as provided for by this Section, if additional alterations or reconstructions are required to be made because of surveys conducted by an architect or engineer licensed in the State of Illinois, the district may levy a tax at a rate not to exceed .05% per year upon all the taxable property of the district or issue additional bonds, whichever action shall be the most feasible.
    (p) This Section is cumulative and constitutes complete authority for the issuance of bonds as provided in this Section notwithstanding any other statute or law to the contrary.
    (q) With respect to instruments for the payment of money issued under this Section either before, on, or after the effective date of Public Act 86-004 (June 6, 1989), it is, and always has been, the intention of the General Assembly (i) that the Omnibus Bond Acts are, and always have been, supplementary grants of power to issue instruments in accordance with the Omnibus Bond Acts, regardless of any provision of this Act that may appear to be or to have been more restrictive than those Acts, (ii) that the provisions of this Section are not a limitation on the supplementary authority granted by the Omnibus Bond Acts, and (iii) that instruments issued under this Section within the supplementary authority granted by the Omnibus Bond Acts are not invalid because of any provision of this Act that may appear to be or to have been more restrictive than those Acts.
    (r) When the purposes for which the bonds are issued have been accomplished and paid for in full and there remain funds on hand from the proceeds of the bond sale and interest earnings therefrom, the board shall, by resolution, use such excess funds in accordance with the provisions of Section 10-22.14 of this Act.
    (s) Whenever any tax is levied or bonds issued for fire prevention, safety, energy conservation, and school security purposes, such proceeds shall be deposited and accounted for separately within the Fire Prevention and Safety Fund.

    Sec. 17-3. Additional levies-Submission to voters.
    (a) The school board in any district having a population of less than 500,000 inhabitants may, by proper resolution, cause a proposition to increase, for a limited period of not less than 3 nor more than 10 years or for an unlimited period, the annual tax rate for educational purposes to be submitted to the voters of such district at a regular scheduled election as follows:
        (1) in districts maintaining grades 1 through 8, or
    	
grades 9 through 12, the maximum rate for educational purposes shall not exceed 3.5% of the value as equalized or assessed by the Department of Revenue;
        (2) in districts maintaining grades 1 through 12 the
    	
maximum rate for educational purposes shall not exceed 4.00% of the value as equalized or assessed by the Department of Revenue except that if a single elementary district and a secondary district having boundaries that are coterminous form a community unit district on or after the effective date of this amendatory Act of the 94th General Assembly and the actual combined rate of the elementary district and secondary district prior to the formation of the community unit district is greater than 4.00%, then the maximum rate for educational purposes for such district shall be the following:
            (A) For 2 years following the formation of the
        	
community unit district, the maximum rate shall equal the actual combined rate of the previous elementary district and secondary district.
            (B) In each subsequent year, the maximum rate
        	
shall be reduced by 0.10% or reduced to 4.00%, whichever reduction is less. The school board may, by proper resolution, cause a proposition to increase the reduced rate, not to exceed the maximum rate in clause (A), to be submitted to the voters of the district at a regular scheduled election as provided under this Section. Nothing in this Section shall require that the maximum rate for educational purpose for a district maintaining grades one through 12 be reduced below 4.00%.
    If the resolution of the school board seeks to increase the annual tax rate for educational purposes for a limited period of not less than 3 nor more than 10 years, the proposition shall so state and shall identify the years for which the tax increase is sought.
    If a majority of the votes cast on the proposition is in favor thereof at an election for which the election authorities have given notice either (i) in accordance with Section 12-5 of the Election Code or (ii) by publication of a true and legible copy of the specimen ballot label containing the proposition in the form in which it appeared or will appear on the official ballot label on the day of the election at least 5 days before the day of the election in at least one newspaper published in and having a general circulation in the district, the school board may thereafter, until such authority is revoked in like manner, levy annually the tax so authorized; provided that if the proposition as approved limits the increase in the annual tax rate of the district for educational purposes to a period of not less than 3 nor more than 10 years, the district may, unless such authority is sooner revoked in like manner, levy annually the tax so authorized for the limited number of years approved by a majority of the votes cast on the proposition. Upon expiration of that limited period, the rate at which the district may annually levy its tax for educational purposes shall be the rate provided under Section 17-2, or the rate at which the district last levied its tax for educational purposes prior to approval of the proposition authorizing the levy of that tax at an increased rate, whichever is greater.
    The school board shall certify the proposition to the proper election authorities in accordance with the general election law.
    The provisions of this Section concerning notice of the tax rate increase referendum apply only to consolidated primary elections held prior to January 1, 2002 at which not less than 55% of the voters voting on the tax rate increase proposition voted in favor of the tax rate increase proposition.
    (b) Beginning on the effective date of this amendatory Act of the 97th General Assembly, if a unit district is being established from an elementary district or districts and a high school district, pursuant to Article 11E of this Code, and the combined rate of the elementary district or districts and the high school district prior to the formation of the unit district is greater than 4.00% for educational purposes, then the maximum rate for educational purposes for the unit district shall be the following:
        (1) For the first year following the formation of the
    	
new unit district, the maximum rate shall equal the lesser of the actual combined rate of the previous highest elementary district rate and the high school district rate or 6.40%.
        (2) For the second year after the formation of the
    	
new unit district, the maximum rate shall equal the lesser of the actual combined rate of the previous highest elementary district rate and the high school district rate or 5.80%.
        (3) For the third year after the formation of the new
    	
unit district, the maximum rate shall equal the lesser of the actual combined rate of the previous highest elementary district rate and the high school district rate or 5.20%.
        (4) For the fourth year after the formation of the
    	
new unit district, the maximum rate shall equal the lesser of the actual combined rate of the previous highest elementary district rate and the high school district rate or 4.60%.
        (5) For the fifth year after the formation of the new

    (a) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Article and in addition to the methods provided by other Sections of this Article for increasing the rate of tax levied for any school purpose, Ford Heights School District 169 may levy a supplemental tax for the 2006, 2007, and 2008 taxable years.
    (b) The supplemental tax authorized by this Section is levied upon all the taxable property of the school district at its value as equalized or assessed by the Department of Revenue for each of the years in which the levy is made. The supplemental tax is in addition to all other taxes that the district may levy for any school purpose for the years in which the levy is made.
    (c) For each year that it is levied, the supplemental tax must be levied at a rate not exceeding that which, when applied to the equalized assessed value of all taxable property in the district for that year in which the levy is made, is sufficient to yield that amount of tax revenue that is equal to $1,067,000 for a total of $3,201,000 for all taxable years that the tax is levied.
    (d) The supplemental tax authorized by this Section must be levied by proper resolution of the school board and without referendum. A certified copy of the resolution levying the supplemental tax, signed by the president and clerk or secretary of the school board, must be filed in the office of the county clerk, and it is, then, the duty of the county clerk to extend the supplemental tax. The supplemental tax must be extended and collected in like manner as all other taxes of the school district, but the supplemental tax must be separately identified by the collectors.
    (e) Ford Heights School District 169 may use the proceeds from the supplemental tax for any purpose for which the district is authorized to make expenditures.

    The county clerk shall furnish the school board of any school district, upon request, a certificate showing the last ascertained full, fair cash value of the taxable property of the district.
    When a school district lies partly in two or more counties, the county clerk of each county in which any part of such district lies shall furnish, upon request, to the school board of the district, a certificate showing the last ascertained full, fair cash value of the taxable property in that part of the district lying in such county.
    When making out the tax books for the collector, the county clerk shall compute each taxable person's tax in each school district upon the total amount of taxable property for that year, located in such district, whether belonging to residents or non-residents, upon the valuation produced by the equalization and assessment of property by the county board of review, and all property originally assessed by the Department of Revenue. Such computation shall be made so as to realize the amount of money required to be raised in such district, as shown in the certificate of tax levy, made out by the governing body of such district, and filed with the county clerk as required by this Act. The county clerk shall cause each person's tax, so computed, to be set upon the tax book to be delivered to the collector for that year, in a separate column against each taxpayer's name, or parcel of taxable property, as it appears in the collector's books, to be collected in the same manner, and at the same time, and by the same person, as State and county taxes are collected. He shall number the school districts on the maps in his office to correspond with the numbers of districts as returned to him by the county superintendent of schools, and in making up the tax books to be delivered to the collector of taxes, the county clerk shall copy therein the number of the school districts set opposite each person's assessment of personal property by the assessor making the assessment of such person, and shall extend the school tax on each person's assessment of personal property. The computation of each person's tax and the extension made by the clerk shall be final and conclusive. The rate shall be uniform, and shall not exceed that required by the amount certified by the school board. The county clerk, before delivering the tax book to the collector, shall make and send by mail to each school treasurer of the county a certificate of the amount due his district or districts from the tax so extended and placed on the tax books.

    (105 ILCS 5/18-1) (from Ch. 122, par. 18-1)
    Sec. 18-1. Moneys constituting fund. The common school fund of the state shall consist of any sums accredited thereto in pursuance of law, of the interest on the school fund proper, which fund is 3% upon the proceeds of the sales of public lands in the State, 1/6 part excepted; and the interest on the surplus revenue distributed by Act of Congress and made part of the common school fund by Act of the legislature, March 4, 1837. The interest on the school fund proper and the surplus revenue shall be paid by the State annually at the rate of 6%, and shall be distributed as provided by law.
(Source: Laws 1961, p. 31.)

    (105 ILCS 5/18-3) (from Ch. 122, par. 18-3)
    Sec. 18-3. Tuition of children from orphanages and children's homes. When the children from any home for orphans, dependent, abandoned or maladjusted children maintained by any organization or association admitting to such home children from the State in general or when children residing in a school district wherein the State of Illinois maintains and operates any welfare or penal institution on property owned by the State of Illinois, which contains houses, housing units or housing accommodations within a school district, attend grades kindergarten through 12 of the public schools maintained by that school district, the State Superintendent of Education shall direct the State Comptroller to pay a specified amount sufficient to pay the annual tuition cost of such children who attended such public schools during the regular school year ending on June 30. The Comptroller shall pay the amount after receipt of a voucher submitted by the State Superintendent of Education.
    The amount of the tuition for such children attending the public schools of the district shall be determined by the State Superintendent of Education by multiplying the number of such children in average daily attendance in such schools by 1.2 times the total annual per capita cost of administering the schools of the district. Such total annual per capita cost shall be determined by totaling all expenses of the school district in the educational, operations and maintenance, bond and interest, transportation, Illinois municipal retirement, and rent funds for the school year preceding the filing of such tuition claims less expenditures not applicable to the regular K-12 program, less offsetting revenues from State sources except those from the common school fund, less offsetting revenues from federal sources except those from federal impaction aid, less student and community service revenues, plus a depreciation allowance; and dividing such total by the average daily attendance for the year.
    Annually on or before June 15 the superintendent of the district shall certify to the State Superintendent of Education the following:
        1. The name of the home and of the organization or
    	
association maintaining it; or the legal description of the real estate upon which the house, housing units, or housing accommodations are located and that no taxes or service charges or other payments authorized by law to be made in lieu of taxes were collected therefrom or on account thereof during either of the calendar years included in the school year for which claim is being made;
        2. The number of children from the home or living in
    	
such houses, housing units or housing accommodations and attending the schools of the district;
        3. The total number of children attending the schools
    	
of the district;
        4. The per capita tuition charge of the district; and
        5. The computed amount of the tuition payment claimed
    	
as due.
    Whenever the persons in charge of such home for orphans, dependent, abandoned or maladjusted children have received from the parent or guardian of any such child or by virtue of an order of court a specific allowance for educating such child, such persons shall pay to the school board in the district where the child attends school such amount of the allowance as is necessary to pay the tuition required by such district for the education of the child. If the allowance is insufficient to pay the tuition in full the State Superintendent of Education shall direct the Comptroller to pay to the district the difference between the total tuition charged and the amount of the allowance.
    Whenever the facilities of a school district in which such house, housing units or housing accommodations are located, are limited, pupils may be assigned by that district to the schools of any adjacent district to the limit of the facilities of the adjacent district to properly educate such pupils as shall be determined by the school board of the adjacent district, and the State Superintendent of Education shall direct the Comptroller to pay a specified amount sufficient to pay the annual tuition of the children so assigned to and attending public schools in the adjacent districts and the Comptroller shall draw his warrant upon the State Treasurer for the payment of such amount for the benefit of the adjacent school districts in the same manner as for districts in which the houses, housing units or housing accommodations are located.
    Summer session costs shall be reimbursed based on the actual expenditures for providing these services. On or before November 1 of each year, the superintendent of each eligible school district shall certify to the State Superintendent of Education the claim of the district for the summer session following the regular school year just ended. The State Superintendent of Education shall transmit to the Comptroller no later than December 15th of each year vouchers for payment of amounts due to school districts for summer session.
    Claims for tuition for children from any home for orphans or dependent, abandoned, or maladjusted children shall be paid on a current year basis. On September 30, December 31, and March 31, the State Board of Education shall voucher payments for districts with those students based on an estimated cost calculated from the prior year's claim. The school district shall certify to the State Superintendent of Education the report of claims due for such tuition payments on or before June 15. Claims received by June 15 may be amended until August 1. The State Superintendent of Education shall direct the State Comptroller to pay to the district, on or before August 31, the amount due for the district for the school year in accordance with the calculation of the claim as set forth in this Section. However, notwithstanding any other provisions of this Section or the School Code, beginning with fiscal year 1994 and each fiscal year thereafter, if the amount appropriated for any fiscal year is less than the amount required for purposes of this Section, the amount required to eliminate any insufficient reimbursement for each district claim under this Section shall be reimbursed on August 31 of the next fiscal year. Payments required to eliminate any insufficiency for prior fiscal year claims shall be made before any claims are paid for the current fiscal year.
    If a school district makes a claim for reimbursement under Section 14-7.03 it shall not include in any claim filed under this Section children residing on the property of State institutions included in its claim under Section 14-7.03.
    Any child who is not a resident of Illinois who is placed in a child welfare institution, private facility, State operated program, orphanage or children's home shall have the payment for his educational tuition and any related services assured by the placing agent.
    In order to provide services appropriate to allow a student under the legal guardianship or custodianship of the State to participate in local school district educational programs, costs may be incurred in appropriate cases by the district that are in excess of 1.2 times the district per capita tuition charge allowed under the provisions of this Section. In the event such excess costs are incurred, they must be documented in accordance with cost rules established under the authority of this Section and may then be claimed for reimbursement under this Section.
    Planned services for students eligible for this funding must be a collaborative effort between the appropriate State agency or the student's group home or institution and the local school district.

    Sec. 18-4.3. Summer school grants. Through fiscal year 2017, grants shall be determined for pupil attendance in summer schools conducted under Sections 10-22.33A and 34-18 and approved under Section 2-3.25 in the following manner.
    The amount of grant for each accredited summer school attendance pupil shall be obtained by dividing the total amount of apportionments determined under Section 18-8.05 by the actual number of pupils in average daily attendance used for such apportionments. The number of credited summer school attendance pupils shall be determined (a) by counting clock hours of class instruction by pupils enrolled in grades 1 through 12 in approved courses conducted at least 60 clock hours in summer sessions; (b) by dividing such total of clock hours of class instruction by 4 to produce days of credited pupil attendance; (c) by dividing such days of credited pupil attendance by the actual number of days in the regular term as used in computation in the general apportionment in Section 18-8.05; and (d) by multiplying by 1.25.
    The amount of the grant for a summer school program approved by the State Superintendent of Education for children with disabilities, as defined in Sections 14-1.02 through 14-1.07, shall be determined in the manner contained above except that average daily membership shall be utilized in lieu of average daily attendance.
    In the case of an apportionment based on summer school attendance or membership pupils, the claim therefor shall be presented as a separate claim for the particular school year in which such summer school session ends. On or before November 1 of each year the superintendent of each eligible school district shall certify to the State Superintendent of Education the claim of the district for the summer session just ended. Failure on the part of the school board to so certify shall constitute a forfeiture of its right to such payment. The State Superintendent of Education shall transmit to the Comptroller no later than December 15th of each year vouchers for payment of amounts due school districts for summer school. The State Superintendent of Education shall direct the Comptroller to draw his warrants for payments thereof by the 30th day of December. If the money appropriated by the General Assembly for such purpose for any year is insufficient, it shall be apportioned on the basis of claims approved.
    However, notwithstanding the foregoing provisions, for each fiscal year the money appropriated by the General Assembly for the purposes of this Section shall only be used for grants for approved summer school programs for those children with disabilities served pursuant to Section 14-7.02 or 14-7.02b of this Code.
    No funding shall be provided to school districts under this Section after fiscal year 2017. In fiscal year 2018 and each fiscal year thereafter, all funding received by a school district from the State pursuant to Section 18-8.15 of this Code that is attributable to summer school for special education pupils must be used for special education services authorized under this Code.

For fiscal year 1995 and each fiscal year thereafter, the grant shall equal 0.5% of the equalized assessed valuation of the land owned by the State (computing that equalized assessed valuation by multiplying the average value per taxable acre of the school district by the total number of acres of land owned by the State). Annually on or before September 15, 1994 and July 1, thereafter, the district superintendent shall certify to the State Board of Education the following matters:
        1. The name of the State institution.
        2. The total land area of the district in acres.

    Sec. 18-8.15. Evidence-Based Funding for student success for the 2017-2018 and subsequent school years.
    (a) General provisions.
        (1) The purpose of this Section is to ensure that,
    	
by June 30, 2027 and beyond, this State has a kindergarten through grade 12 public education system with the capacity to ensure the educational development of all persons to the limits of their capacities in accordance with Section 1 of Article X of the Constitution of the State of Illinois. To accomplish that objective, this Section creates a method of funding public education that is evidence-based; is sufficient to ensure every student receives a meaningful opportunity to learn irrespective of race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, gender, or community-income level; and is sustainable and predictable. When fully funded under this Section, every school shall have the resources, based on what the evidence indicates is needed, to:
            (A) provide all students with a high quality
        	
education that offers the academic, enrichment, social and emotional support, technical, and career-focused programs that will allow them to become competitive workers, responsible parents, productive citizens of this State, and active members of our national democracy;
            (B) ensure all students receive the education
        	
they need to graduate from high school with the skills required to pursue post-secondary education and training for a rewarding career;
            (C) reduce, with a goal of eliminating, the
        	
achievement gap between at-risk and non-at-risk students by raising the performance of at-risk students and not by reducing standards; and
            (D) ensure this State satisfies its obligation to
        	
assume the primary responsibility to fund public education and simultaneously relieve the disproportionate burden placed on local property taxes to fund schools.
        (2) The Evidence-Based Funding formula under this
    	
Section shall be applied to all Organizational Units in this State. The Evidence-Based Funding formula outlined in this Act is based on the formula outlined in Senate Bill 1 of the 100th General Assembly, as passed by both legislative chambers. As further defined and described in this Section, there are 4 major components of the Evidence-Based Funding model:
            (A) First, the model calculates a unique Adequacy
        	
Target for each Organizational Unit in this State that considers the costs to implement research-based activities, the unit's student demographics, and regional wage differences.
            (B) Second, the model calculates each
        	
Organizational Unit's Local Capacity, or the amount each Organizational Unit is assumed to contribute toward its Adequacy Target from local resources.
            (C) Third, the model calculates how much funding
        	
the State currently contributes to the Organizational Unit and adds that to the unit's Local Capacity to determine the unit's overall current adequacy of funding.
            (D) Finally, the model's distribution method
        	
allocates new State funding to those Organizational Units that are least well-funded, considering both Local Capacity and State funding, in relation to their Adequacy Target.
        (3) An Organizational Unit receiving any funding
    	
under this Section may apply those funds to any fund so received for which that Organizational Unit is authorized to make expenditures by law.
        (4) As used in this Section, the following terms
    	
shall have the meanings ascribed in this paragraph (4):

The State Board may establish additional requirements for Organizational Unit expenditures of funds received pursuant to this subparagraph (Q), including a requirement that funds received pursuant to this subparagraph (Q) may be used only for serving the technology needs of the district. It is the intent of Public Act 100-465 that all Tier 1 and Tier 2 districts receive the addition to their Adequacy Target in the following year, subject to compliance with the requirements of the State Board.
            (R) Student activities investments. Each

                (i) one FTE teacher position for every 141
            	
combined ASE of pre-kindergarten children with disabilities and all kindergarten through grade 12 students;
                (ii) one FTE instructional assistant for
            	
every 141 combined ASE of pre-kindergarten children with disabilities and all kindergarten through grade 12 students; and
                (iii) one FTE psychologist position for every
            	
1,000 combined ASE of pre-kindergarten children with disabilities and all kindergarten through grade 12 students.
        (3) For calculating the salaries included within the
    	
Essential Elements, the State Superintendent shall annually calculate average salaries to the nearest dollar using the employment information system data maintained by the State Board, limited to public schools only and excluding special education and vocational cooperatives, schools operated by the Department of Juvenile Justice, and charter schools, for the following positions:
            (A) Teacher for grades K through 8.
            (B) Teacher for grades 9 through 12.
            (C) Teacher for grades K through 12.
            (D) Guidance counselor for grades K through 8.
            (E) Guidance counselor for grades 9 through 12.
            (F) Guidance counselor for grades K through 12.
            (G) Social worker.
            (H) Psychologist.
            (I) Librarian.
            (J) Nurse.
            (K) Principal.
            (L) Assistant principal.
        For the purposes of this paragraph (3), "teacher"
    	
includes core teachers, specialist and elective teachers, instructional facilitators, tutors, special education teachers, pupil support staff teachers, English learner teachers, extended day teachers, and summer school teachers. Where specific grade data is not required for the Essential Elements, the average salary for corresponding positions shall apply. For substitute teachers, the average teacher salary for grades K through 12 shall apply.
        For calculating the salaries included within the
    	
Essential Elements for positions not included within EIS Data, the following salaries shall be used in the first year of implementation of Evidence-Based Funding:
            (i) school site staff, $30,000; and
            (ii) non-instructional assistant, instructional
        	
assistant, library aide, library media tech, or supervisory aide: $25,000.
        In the second and subsequent years of implementation
    	
of Evidence-Based Funding, the amounts in items (i) and (ii) of this paragraph (3) shall annually increase by the ECI.
        The salary amounts for the Essential Elements
    	
determined pursuant to subparagraphs (A) through (L), (S) and (T), and (V) through (X) of paragraph (2) of subsection (b) of this Section shall be multiplied by a Regionalization Factor.
    (c) Local Capacity calculation.
        (1) Each Organizational Unit's Local Capacity
    	
represents an amount of funding it is assumed to contribute toward its Adequacy Target for purposes of the Evidence-Based Funding formula calculation. "Local Capacity" means either (i) the Organizational Unit's Local Capacity Target as calculated in accordance with paragraph (2) of this subsection (c) if its Real Receipts are equal to or less than its Local Capacity Target or (ii) the Organizational Unit's Adjusted Local Capacity, as calculated in accordance with paragraph (3) of this subsection (c) if Real Receipts are more than its Local Capacity Target.
        (2) "Local Capacity Target" means, for an
    	
Organizational Unit, that dollar amount that is obtained by multiplying its Adequacy Target by its Local Capacity Ratio.
            (A) An Organizational Unit's Local Capacity
        	
Percentage is the conversion of the Organizational Unit's Local Capacity Ratio, as such ratio is determined in accordance with subparagraph (B) of this paragraph (2), into a cumulative distribution resulting in a percentile ranking to determine each Organizational Unit's relative position to all other Organizational Units in this State. The calculation of Local Capacity Percentage is described in subparagraph (C) of this paragraph (2).
            (B) An Organizational Unit's Local Capacity Ratio
        	
in a given year is the percentage obtained by dividing its Adjusted EAV or PTELL EAV, whichever is less, by its Adequacy Target, with the resulting ratio further adjusted as follows:
                (i) for Organizational Units serving grades
            	
kindergarten through 12 and Hybrid Districts, no further adjustments shall be made;
                (ii) for Organizational Units serving grades
            	
kindergarten through 8, the ratio shall be multiplied by 9/13;
                (iii) for Organizational Units serving grades
            	
9 through 12, the Local Capacity Ratio shall be multiplied by 4/13; and
                (iv) for an Organizational Unit with a
            	
different grade configuration than those specified in items (i) through (iii) of this subparagraph (B), the State Superintendent shall determine a comparable adjustment based on the grades served.
            (C) The Local Capacity Percentage is equal to the
        	
percentile ranking of the district. Local Capacity Percentage converts each Organizational Unit's Local Capacity Ratio to a cumulative distribution resulting in a percentile ranking to determine each Organizational Unit's relative position to all other Organizational Units in this State. The Local Capacity Percentage cumulative distribution resulting in a percentile ranking for each Organizational Unit shall be calculated using the standard normal distribution of the score in relation to the weighted mean and weighted standard deviation and Local Capacity Ratios of all Organizational Units. If the value assigned to any Organizational Unit is in excess of 90%, the value shall be adjusted to 90%. For Laboratory Schools, the Local Capacity Percentage shall be set at 10% in recognition of the absence of EAV and resources from the public university that are allocated to the Laboratory School. For programs operated by a regional office of education or an intermediate service center, the Local Capacity Percentage must be set at 10% in recognition of the absence of EAV and resources from school districts that are allocated to the regional office of education or intermediate service center. The weighted mean for the Local Capacity Percentage shall be determined by multiplying each Organizational Unit's Local Capacity Ratio times the ASE for the unit creating a weighted value, summing the weighted values of all Organizational Units, and dividing by the total ASE of all Organizational Units. The weighted standard deviation shall be determined by taking the square root of the weighted variance of all Organizational Units' Local Capacity Ratio, where the variance is calculated by squaring the difference between each unit's Local Capacity Ratio and the weighted mean, then multiplying the variance for each unit times the ASE for the unit to create a weighted variance for each unit, then summing all units' weighted variance and dividing by the total ASE of all units.
            (D) For any Organizational Unit, the
        	
Organizational Unit's Adjusted Local Capacity Target shall be reduced by either (i) the school board's remaining contribution pursuant to paragraph (ii) of subsection (b-4) of Section 16-158 of the Illinois Pension Code in a given year or (ii) the board of education's remaining contribution pursuant to paragraph (iv) of subsection (b) of Section 17-129 of the Illinois Pension Code absent the employer normal cost portion of the required contribution and amount allowed pursuant to subdivision (3) of Section 17-142.1 of the Illinois Pension Code in a given year. In the preceding sentence, item (i) shall be certified to the State Board of Education by the Teachers' Retirement System of the State of Illinois and item (ii) shall be certified to the State Board of Education by the Public School Teachers' Pension and Retirement Fund of the City of Chicago.
        (3) If an Organizational Unit's Real Receipts are
    	
more than its Local Capacity Target, then its Local Capacity shall equal an Adjusted Local Capacity Target as calculated in accordance with this paragraph (3). The Adjusted Local Capacity Target is calculated as the sum of the Organizational Unit's Local Capacity Target and its Real Receipts Adjustment. The Real Receipts Adjustment equals the Organizational Unit's Real Receipts less its Local Capacity Target, with the resulting figure multiplied by the Local Capacity Percentage.
        As used in this paragraph (3), "Real Percent of
    	
Adequacy" means the sum of an Organizational Unit's Real Receipts, CPPRT, and Base Funding Minimum, with the resulting figure divided by the Organizational Unit's Adequacy Target.
    (d) Calculation of Real Receipts, EAV, and Adjusted EAV for purposes of the Local Capacity calculation.
        (1) An Organizational Unit's Real Receipts are the
    	
product of its Applicable Tax Rate and its Adjusted EAV. An Organizational Unit's Applicable Tax Rate is its Adjusted Operating Tax Rate for property within the Organizational Unit.
        (2) The State Superintendent shall calculate the
    	
equalized assessed valuation, or EAV, of all taxable property of each Organizational Unit as of September 30 of the previous year in accordance with paragraph (3) of this subsection (d). The State Superintendent shall then determine the Adjusted EAV of each Organizational Unit in accordance with paragraph (4) of this subsection (d), which Adjusted EAV figure shall be used for the purposes of calculating Local Capacity.
        (3) To calculate Real Receipts and EAV, the
    	
Department of Revenue shall supply to the State Superintendent the value as equalized or assessed by the Department of Revenue of all taxable property of every Organizational Unit, together with (i) the applicable tax rate used in extending taxes for the funds of the Organizational Unit as of September 30 of the previous year and (ii) the limiting rate for all Organizational Units subject to property tax extension limitations as imposed under PTELL.
            (A) The Department of Revenue shall add to the
        	
equalized assessed value of all taxable property of each Organizational Unit situated entirely or partially within a county that is or was subject to the provisions of Section 15-176 or 15-177 of the Property Tax Code (i) an amount equal to the total amount by which the homestead exemption allowed under Section 15-176 or 15-177 of the Property Tax Code for real property situated in that Organizational Unit exceeds the total amount that would have been allowed in that Organizational Unit if the maximum reduction under Section 15-176 was (I) $4,500 in Cook County or $3,500 in all other counties in tax year 2003 or (II) $5,000 in all counties in tax year 2004 and thereafter and (ii) an amount equal to the aggregate amount for the taxable year of all additional exemptions under Section 15-175 of the Property Tax Code for owners with a household income of $30,000 or less. The county clerk of any county that is or was subject to the provisions of Section 15-176 or 15-177 of the Property Tax Code shall annually calculate and certify to the Department of Revenue for each Organizational Unit all homestead exemption amounts under Section 15-176 or 15-177 of the Property Tax Code and all amounts of additional exemptions under Section 15-175 of the Property Tax Code for owners with a household income of $30,000 or less. It is the intent of this subparagraph (A) that if the general homestead exemption for a parcel of property is determined under Section 15-176 or 15-177 of the Property Tax Code rather than Section 15-175, then the calculation of EAV shall not be affected by the difference, if any, between the amount of the general homestead exemption allowed for that parcel of property under Section 15-176 or 15-177 of the Property Tax Code and the amount that would have been allowed had the general homestead exemption for that parcel of property been determined under Section 15-175 of the Property Tax Code. It is further the intent of this subparagraph (A) that if additional exemptions are allowed under Section 15-175 of the Property Tax Code for owners with a household income of less than $30,000, then the calculation of EAV shall not be affected by the difference, if any, because of those additional exemptions.
            (B) With respect to any part of an Organizational
        	
Unit within a redevelopment project area in respect to which a municipality has adopted tax increment allocation financing pursuant to the Tax Increment Allocation Redevelopment Act, Division 74.4 of Article 11 of the Illinois Municipal Code, or the Industrial Jobs Recovery Law, Division 74.6 of Article 11 of the Illinois Municipal Code, no part of the current EAV of real property located in any such project area that is attributable to an increase above the total initial EAV of such property shall be used as part of the EAV of the Organizational Unit, until such time as all redevelopment project costs have been paid, as provided in Section 11-74.4-8 of the Tax Increment Allocation Redevelopment Act or in Section 11-74.6-35 of the Industrial Jobs Recovery Law. For the purpose of the EAV of the Organizational Unit, the total initial EAV or the current EAV, whichever is lower, shall be used until such time as all redevelopment project costs have been paid.
            (B-5) The real property equalized assessed
        	
valuation for a school district shall be adjusted by subtracting from the real property value, as equalized or assessed by the Department of Revenue, for the district an amount computed by dividing the amount of any abatement of taxes under Section 18-170 of the Property Tax Code by 3.00% for a district maintaining grades kindergarten through 12, by 2.30% for a district maintaining grades kindergarten through 8, or by 1.05% for a district maintaining grades 9 through 12 and adjusted by an amount computed by dividing the amount of any abatement of taxes under subsection (a) of Section 18-165 of the Property Tax Code by the same percentage rates for district type as specified in this subparagraph (B-5).
            (C) For Organizational Units that are Hybrid
        	
Districts, the State Superintendent shall use the lesser of the adjusted equalized assessed valuation for property within the partial elementary unit district for elementary purposes, as defined in Article 11E of this Code, or the adjusted equalized assessed valuation for property within the partial elementary unit district for high school purposes, as defined in Article 11E of this Code.
        (4) An Organizational Unit's Adjusted EAV shall be
    	
the average of its EAV over the immediately preceding 3 years or its EAV in the immediately preceding year if the EAV in the immediately preceding year has declined by 10% or more compared to the 3-year average. In the event of Organizational Unit reorganization, consolidation, or annexation, the Organizational Unit's Adjusted EAV for the first 3 years after such change shall be as follows: the most current EAV shall be used in the first year, the average of a 2-year EAV or its EAV in the immediately preceding year if the EAV declines by 10% or more compared to the 2-year average for the second year, and a 3-year average EAV or its EAV in the immediately preceding year if the Adjusted EAV declines by 10% or more compared to the 3-year average for the third year. For any school district whose EAV in the immediately preceding year is used in calculations, in the following year, the Adjusted EAV shall be the average of its EAV over the immediately preceding 2 years or the immediately preceding year if that year represents a decline of 10% or more compared to the 2-year average.
        "PTELL EAV" means a figure calculated by the State
    	
Board for Organizational Units subject to PTELL as described in this paragraph (4) for the purposes of calculating an Organizational Unit's Local Capacity Ratio. Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (4), the PTELL EAV of an Organizational Unit shall be equal to the product of the equalized assessed valuation last used in the calculation of general State aid under Section 18-8.05 of this Code (now repealed) or Evidence-Based Funding under this Section and the Organizational Unit's Extension Limitation Ratio. If an Organizational Unit has approved or does approve an increase in its limiting rate, pursuant to Section 18-190 of the Property Tax Code, affecting the Base Tax Year, the PTELL EAV shall be equal to the product of the equalized assessed valuation last used in the calculation of general State aid under Section 18-8.05 of this Code (now repealed) or Evidence-Based Funding under this Section multiplied by an amount equal to one plus the percentage increase, if any, in the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers for all items published by the United States Department of Labor for the 12-month calendar year preceding the Base Tax Year, plus the equalized assessed valuation of new property, annexed property, and recovered tax increment value and minus the equalized assessed valuation of disconnected property.
        As used in this paragraph (4), "new property" and
    	
"recovered tax increment value" shall have the meanings set forth in the Property Tax Extension Limitation Law.
    (e) Base Funding Minimum calculation.
        (1) For the 2017-2018 school year, the Base Funding
    	
Minimum of an Organizational Unit or a Specially Funded Unit shall be the amount of State funds distributed to the Organizational Unit or Specially Funded Unit during the 2016-2017 school year prior to any adjustments and specified appropriation amounts described in this paragraph (1) from the following Sections, as calculated by the State Superintendent: Section 18-8.05 of this Code (now repealed); Section 5 of Article 224 of Public Act 99-524 (equity grants); Section 14-7.02b of this Code (funding for children requiring special education services); Section 14-13.01 of this Code (special education facilities and staffing), except for reimbursement of the cost of transportation pursuant to Section 14-13.01; Section 14C-12 of this Code (English learners); and Section 18-4.3 of this Code (summer school), based on an appropriation level of $13,121,600. For a school district organized under Article 34 of this Code, the Base Funding Minimum also includes (i) the funds allocated to the school district pursuant to Section 1D-1 of this Code attributable to funding programs authorized by the Sections of this Code listed in the preceding sentence and (ii) the difference between (I) the funds allocated to the school district pursuant to Section 1D-1 of this Code attributable to the funding programs authorized by Section 14-7.02 (non-public special education reimbursement), subsection (b) of Section 14-13.01 (special education transportation), Section 29-5 (transportation), Section 2-3.80 (agricultural education), Section 2-3.66 (truants' alternative education), Section 2-3.62 (educational service centers), and Section 14-7.03 (special education - orphanage) of this Code and Section 15 of the Childhood Hunger Relief Act (free breakfast program) and (II) the school district's actual expenditures for its non-public special education, special education transportation, transportation programs, agricultural education, truants' alternative education, services that would otherwise be performed by a regional office of education, special education orphanage expenditures, and free breakfast, as most recently calculated and reported pursuant to subsection (f) of Section 1D-1 of this Code. The Base Funding Minimum for Glenwood Academy shall be $625,500. For programs operated by a regional office of education or an intermediate service center, the Base Funding Minimum must be the total amount of State funds allocated to those programs in the 2018-2019 school year and amounts provided pursuant to Article 34 of Public Act 100-586 and Section 3-16 of this Code. All programs established after June 5, 2019 (the effective date of Public Act 101-10) and administered by a regional office of education or an intermediate service center must have an initial Base Funding Minimum set to an amount equal to the first-year ASE multiplied by the amount of per pupil funding received in the previous school year by the lowest funded similar existing program type. If the enrollment for a program operated by a regional office of education or an intermediate service center is zero, then it may not receive Base Funding Minimum funds for that program in the next fiscal year, and those funds must be distributed to Organizational Units under subsection (g).
        (2) For the 2018-2019 and subsequent school years,
    	
the Base Funding Minimum of Organizational Units and Specially Funded Units shall be the sum of (i) the amount of Evidence-Based Funding for the prior school year, (ii) the Base Funding Minimum for the prior school year, and (iii) any amount received by a school district pursuant to Section 7 of Article 97 of Public Act 100-21.
        (3) Subject to approval by the General Assembly as
    	
provided in this paragraph (3), an Organizational Unit that meets all of the following criteria, as determined by the State Board, shall have District Intervention Money added to its Base Funding Minimum at the time the Base Funding Minimum is calculated by the State Board:
            (A) The Organizational Unit is operating under
        	
an Independent Authority under Section 2-3.25f-5 of this Code for a minimum of 4 school years or is subject to the control of the State Board pursuant to a court order for a minimum of 4 school years.
            (B) The Organizational Unit was designated as a
        	
Tier 1 or Tier 2 Organizational Unit in the previous school year under paragraph (3) of subsection (g) of this Section.
            (C) The Organizational Unit demonstrates
        	
sustainability through a 5-year financial and strategic plan.
            (D) The Organizational Unit has made sufficient
        	
progress and achieved sufficient stability in the areas of governance, academic growth, and finances.
        As part of its determination under this paragraph
    	
(3), the State Board may consider the Organizational Unit's summative designation, any accreditations of the Organizational Unit, or the Organizational Unit's financial profile, as calculated by the State Board.
        If the State Board determines that an Organizational
    	
Unit has met the criteria set forth in this paragraph (3), it must submit a report to the General Assembly, no later than January 2 of the fiscal year in which the State Board makes it determination, on the amount of District Intervention Money to add to the Organizational Unit's Base Funding Minimum. The General Assembly must review the State Board's report and may approve or disapprove, by joint resolution, the addition of District Intervention Money. If the General Assembly fails to act on the report within 40 calendar days from the receipt of the report, the addition of District Intervention Money is deemed approved. If the General Assembly approves the amount of District Intervention Money to be added to the Organizational Unit's Base Funding Minimum, the District Intervention Money must be added to the Base Funding Minimum annually thereafter.
        For the first 4 years following the initial year that
    	
the State Board determines that an Organizational Unit has met the criteria set forth in this paragraph (3) and has received funding under this Section, the Organizational Unit must annually submit to the State Board, on or before November 30, a progress report regarding its financial and strategic plan under subparagraph (C) of this paragraph (3). The plan shall include the financial data from the past 4 annual financial reports or financial audits that must be presented to the State Board by November 15 of each year and the approved budget financial data for the current year. The plan shall be developed according to the guidelines presented to the Organizational Unit by the State Board. The plan shall further include financial projections for the next 3 fiscal years and include a discussion and financial summary of the Organizational Unit's facility needs. If the Organizational Unit does not demonstrate sufficient progress toward its 5-year plan or if it has failed to file an annual financial report, an annual budget, a financial plan, a deficit reduction plan, or other financial information as required by law, the State Board may establish a Financial Oversight Panel under Article 1H of this Code. However, if the Organizational Unit already has a Financial Oversight Panel, the State Board may extend the duration of the Panel.
    (f) Percent of Adequacy and Final Resources calculation.
        (1) The Evidence-Based Funding formula establishes a
    	
Percent of Adequacy for each Organizational Unit in order to place such units into tiers for the purposes of the funding distribution system described in subsection (g) of this Section. Initially, an Organizational Unit's Preliminary Resources and Preliminary Percent of Adequacy are calculated pursuant to paragraph (2) of this subsection (f). Then, an Organizational Unit's Final Resources and Final Percent of Adequacy are calculated to account for the Organizational Unit's poverty concentration levels pursuant to paragraphs (3) and (4) of this subsection (f).
        (2) An Organizational Unit's Preliminary Resources
    	
are equal to the sum of its Local Capacity Target, CPPRT, and Base Funding Minimum. An Organizational Unit's Preliminary Percent of Adequacy is the lesser of (i) its Preliminary Resources divided by its Adequacy Target or (ii) 100%.
        (3) Except for Specially Funded Units, an
    	
Organizational Unit's Final Resources are equal to the sum of its Local Capacity, CPPRT, and Adjusted Base Funding Minimum. The Base Funding Minimum of each Specially Funded Unit shall serve as its Final Resources, except that the Base Funding Minimum for State-approved charter schools shall not include any portion of general State aid allocated in the prior year based on the per capita tuition charge times the charter school enrollment.
        (4) An Organizational Unit's Final Percent of
    	
Adequacy is its Final Resources divided by its Adequacy Target. An Organizational Unit's Adjusted Base Funding Minimum is equal to its Base Funding Minimum less its Supplemental Grant Funding, with the resulting figure added to the product of its Supplemental Grant Funding and Preliminary Percent of Adequacy.
    (g) Evidence-Based Funding formula distribution system.
        (1) In each school year under the Evidence-Based
    	
Funding formula, each Organizational Unit receives funding equal to the sum of its Base Funding Minimum and the unit's allocation of New State Funds determined pursuant to this subsection (g). To allocate New State Funds, the Evidence-Based Funding formula distribution system first places all Organizational Units into one of 4 tiers in accordance with paragraph (3) of this subsection (g), based on the Organizational Unit's Final Percent of Adequacy. New State Funds are allocated to each of the 4 tiers as follows: Tier 1 Aggregate Funding equals 50% of all New State Funds, Tier 2 Aggregate Funding equals 49% of all New State Funds, Tier 3 Aggregate Funding equals 0.9% of all New State Funds, and Tier 4 Aggregate Funding equals 0.1% of all New State Funds. Each Organizational Unit within Tier 1 or Tier 2 receives an allocation of New State Funds equal to its tier Funding Gap, as defined in the following sentence, multiplied by the tier's Allocation Rate determined pursuant to paragraph (4) of this subsection (g). For Tier 1, an Organizational Unit's Funding Gap equals the tier's Target Ratio, as specified in paragraph (5) of this subsection (g), multiplied by the Organizational Unit's Adequacy Target, with the resulting amount reduced by the Organizational Unit's Final Resources. For Tier 2, an Organizational Unit's Funding Gap equals the tier's Target Ratio, as described in paragraph (5) of this subsection (g), multiplied by the Organizational Unit's Adequacy Target, with the resulting amount reduced by the Organizational Unit's Final Resources and its Tier 1 funding allocation. To determine the Organizational Unit's Funding Gap, the resulting amount is then multiplied by a factor equal to one minus the Organizational Unit's Local Capacity Target percentage. Each Organizational Unit within Tier 3 or Tier 4 receives an allocation of New State Funds equal to the product of its Adequacy Target and the tier's Allocation Rate, as specified in paragraph (4) of this subsection (g).
        (2) To ensure equitable distribution of dollars for
    	
all Tier 2 Organizational Units, no Tier 2 Organizational Unit shall receive fewer dollars per ASE than any Tier 3 Organizational Unit. Each Tier 2 and Tier 3 Organizational Unit shall have its funding allocation divided by its ASE. Any Tier 2 Organizational Unit with a funding allocation per ASE below the greatest Tier 3 allocation per ASE shall get a funding allocation equal to the greatest Tier 3 funding allocation per ASE multiplied by the Organizational Unit's ASE. Each Tier 2 Organizational Unit's Tier 2 funding allocation shall be multiplied by the percentage calculated by dividing the original Tier 2 Aggregate Funding by the sum of all Tier 2 Organizational Units' Tier 2 funding allocation after adjusting districts' funding below Tier 3 levels.
        (3) Organizational Units are placed into one of 4
    	
tiers as follows:
            (A) Tier 1 consists of all Organizational Units,
        	
except for Specially Funded Units, with a Percent of Adequacy less than the Tier 1 Target Ratio. The Tier 1 Target Ratio is the ratio level that allows for Tier 1 Aggregate Funding to be distributed, with the Tier 1 Allocation Rate determined pursuant to paragraph (4) of this subsection (g).
            (B) Tier 2 consists of all Tier 1 Units and all
        	
other Organizational Units, except for Specially Funded Units, with a Percent of Adequacy of less than 0.90.
            (C) Tier 3 consists of all Organizational Units,
        	
except for Specially Funded Units, with a Percent of Adequacy of at least 0.90 and less than 1.0.
            (D) Tier 4 consists of all Organizational Units
        	
with a Percent of Adequacy of at least 1.0.
        (4) The Allocation Rates for Tiers 1 through 4 are
    	
determined as follows:
            (A) The Tier 1 Allocation Rate is 30%.
            (B) The Tier 2 Allocation Rate is the result of
        	
the following equation: Tier 2 Aggregate Funding, divided by the sum of the Funding Gaps for all Tier 2 Organizational Units, unless the result of such equation is higher than 1.0. If the result of such equation is higher than 1.0, then the Tier 2 Allocation Rate is 1.0.
            (C) The Tier 3 Allocation Rate is the result of
        	
the following equation: Tier 3 Aggregate Funding, divided by the sum of the Adequacy Targets of all Tier 3 Organizational Units.
            (D) The Tier 4 Allocation Rate is the result of
        	
the following equation: Tier 4 Aggregate Funding, divided by the sum of the Adequacy Targets of all Tier 4 Organizational Units.
        (5) A tier's Target Ratio is determined as follows:
            (A) The Tier 1 Target Ratio is the ratio level
        	
that allows for Tier 1 Aggregate Funding to be distributed with the Tier 1 Allocation Rate.
            (B) The Tier 2 Target Ratio is 0.90.
            (C) The Tier 3 Target Ratio is 1.0.
        (6) If, at any point, the Tier 1 Target Ratio is
    	
greater than 90%, then all Tier 1 funding shall be allocated to Tier 2 and no Tier 1 Organizational Unit's funding may be identified.
        (7) In the event that all Tier 2 Organizational Units
    	
receive funding at the Tier 2 Target Ratio level, any remaining New State Funds shall be allocated to Tier 3 and Tier 4 Organizational Units.
        (8) If any Specially Funded Units, excluding Glenwood
    	
Academy, recognized by the State Board do not qualify for direct funding following the implementation of Public Act 100-465 from any of the funding sources included within the definition of Base Funding Minimum, the unqualified portion of the Base Funding Minimum shall be transferred to one or more appropriate Organizational Units as determined by the State Superintendent based on the prior year ASE of the Organizational Units.
        (8.5) If a school district withdraws from a special
    	
education cooperative, the portion of the Base Funding Minimum that is attributable to the school district may be redistributed to the school district upon withdrawal. The school district and the cooperative must include the amount of the Base Funding Minimum that is to be reapportioned in their withdrawal agreement and notify the State Board of the change with a copy of the agreement upon withdrawal.
        (9) The Minimum Funding Level is intended to
    	
establish a target for State funding that will keep pace with inflation and continue to advance equity through the Evidence-Based Funding formula. The target for State funding of New Property Tax Relief Pool Funds is $50,000,000 for State fiscal year 2019 and subsequent State fiscal years. The Minimum Funding Level is equal to $350,000,000. In addition to any New State Funds, no more than $50,000,000 New Property Tax Relief Pool Funds may be counted toward the Minimum Funding Level. If the sum of New State Funds and applicable New Property Tax Relief Pool Funds are less than the Minimum Funding Level, than funding for tiers shall be reduced in the following manner:
            (A) First, Tier 4 funding shall be reduced by an
        	
amount equal to the difference between the Minimum Funding Level and New State Funds until such time as Tier 4 funding is exhausted.
            (B) Next, Tier 3 funding shall be reduced by an
        	
amount equal to the difference between the Minimum Funding Level and New State Funds and the reduction in Tier 4 funding until such time as Tier 3 funding is exhausted.
            (C) Next, Tier 2 funding shall be reduced by an
        	
amount equal to the difference between the Minimum Funding Level and New State Funds and the reduction in Tier 4 and Tier 3.
            (D) Finally, Tier 1 funding shall be reduced by
        	
an amount equal to the difference between the Minimum Funding level and New State Funds and the reduction in Tier 2, 3, and 4 funding. In addition, the Allocation Rate for Tier 1 shall be reduced to a percentage equal to the Tier 1 Allocation Rate set by paragraph (4) of this subsection (g), multiplied by the result of New State Funds divided by the Minimum Funding Level.
        (9.5) For State fiscal year 2019 and subsequent State
    	
fiscal years, if New State Funds exceed $300,000,000, then any amount in excess of $300,000,000 shall be dedicated for purposes of Section 2-3.170 of this Code up to a maximum of $50,000,000.
        (10) In the event of a decrease in the amount of the
    	
appropriation for this Section in any fiscal year after implementation of this Section, the Organizational Units receiving Tier 1 and Tier 2 funding, as determined under paragraph (3) of this subsection (g), shall be held harmless by establishing a Base Funding Guarantee equal to the per pupil kindergarten through grade 12 funding received in accordance with this Section in the prior fiscal year. Reductions shall be made to the Base Funding Minimum of Organizational Units in Tier 3 and Tier 4 on a per pupil basis equivalent to the total number of the ASE in Tier 3-funded and Tier 4-funded Organizational Units divided by the total reduction in State funding. The Base Funding Minimum as reduced shall continue to be applied to Tier 3 and Tier 4 Organizational Units and adjusted by the relative formula when increases in appropriations for this Section resume. In no event may State funding reductions to Organizational Units in Tier 3 or Tier 4 exceed an amount that would be less than the Base Funding Minimum established in the first year of implementation of this Section. If additional reductions are required, all school districts shall receive a reduction by a per pupil amount equal to the aggregate additional appropriation reduction divided by the total ASE of all Organizational Units.
        (11) The State Superintendent shall make minor
    	
adjustments to the distribution formula set forth in this subsection (g) to account for the rounding of percentages to the nearest tenth of a percentage and dollar amounts to the nearest whole dollar.
    (h) State Superintendent administration of funding and district submission requirements.
        (1) The State Superintendent shall, in accordance
    	
with appropriations made by the General Assembly, meet the funding obligations created under this Section.
        (2) The State Superintendent shall calculate the
    	
Adequacy Target for each Organizational Unit and Net State Contribution Target for each Organizational Unit under this Section. No Evidence-Based Funding shall be distributed within an Organizational Unit without the approval of the unit's school board.
        (3) Annually, the State Superintendent shall
    	
calculate and report to each Organizational Unit the unit's aggregate financial adequacy amount, which shall be the sum of the Adequacy Target for each Organizational Unit. The State Superintendent shall calculate and report separately for each Organizational Unit the unit's total State funds allocated for its students with disabilities. The State Superintendent shall calculate and report separately for each Organizational Unit the amount of funding and applicable FTE calculated for each Essential Element of the unit's Adequacy Target.
        (4) Annually, the State Superintendent shall
    	
calculate and report to each Organizational Unit the amount the unit must expend on special education and bilingual education and computer technology and equipment for Organizational Units assigned to Tier 1 or Tier 2 that received an additional $285.50 per student computer technology and equipment investment grant to their Adequacy Target pursuant to the unit's Base Funding Minimum, Special Education Allocation, Bilingual Education Allocation, and computer technology and equipment investment allocation.
        (5) Moneys distributed under this Section shall be
    	
calculated on a school year basis, but paid on a fiscal year basis, with payments beginning in August and extending through June. Unless otherwise provided, the moneys appropriated for each fiscal year shall be distributed in 22 equal payments at least 2 times monthly to each Organizational Unit. If moneys appropriated for any fiscal year are distributed other than monthly, the distribution shall be on the same basis for each Organizational Unit.
        (6) Any school district that fails, for any given
    	
school year, to maintain school as required by law or to maintain a recognized school is not eligible to receive Evidence-Based Funding. In case of non-recognition of one or more attendance centers in a school district otherwise operating recognized schools, the claim of the district shall be reduced in the proportion that the enrollment in the attendance center or centers bears to the enrollment of the school district. "Recognized school" means any public school that meets the standards for recognition by the State Board. A school district or attendance center not having recognition status at the end of a school term is entitled to receive State aid payments due upon a legal claim that was filed while it was recognized.
        (7) School district claims filed under this Section
    	
are subject to Sections 18-9 and 18-12 of this Code, except as otherwise provided in this Section.
        (8) Each fiscal year, the State Superintendent shall
    	
calculate for each Organizational Unit an amount of its Base Funding Minimum and Evidence-Based Funding that shall be deemed attributable to the provision of special educational facilities and services, as defined in Section 14-1.08 of this Code, in a manner that ensures compliance with maintenance of State financial support requirements under the federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. An Organizational Unit must use such funds only for the provision of special educational facilities and services, as defined in Section 14-1.08 of this Code, and must comply with any expenditure verification procedures adopted by the State Board.
        (9) All Organizational Units in this State must
    	
submit annual spending plans by the end of September of each year to the State Board as part of the annual budget process, which shall describe how each Organizational Unit will utilize the Base Funding Minimum and Evidence-Based Funding it receives from this State under this Section with specific identification of the intended utilization of Low-Income, English learner, and special education resources. Additionally, the annual spending plans of each Organizational Unit shall describe how the Organizational Unit expects to achieve student growth and how the Organizational Unit will achieve State education goals, as defined by the State Board. The State Superintendent may, from time to time, identify additional requisites for Organizational Units to satisfy when compiling the annual spending plans required under this subsection (h). The format and scope of annual spending plans shall be developed by the State Superintendent and the State Board of Education. School districts that serve students under Article 14C of this Code shall continue to submit information as required under Section 14C-12 of this Code.
        (10) No later than January 1, 2018, the State
    	
Superintendent shall develop a 5-year strategic plan for all Organizational Units to help in planning for adequacy funding under this Section. The State Superintendent shall submit the plan to the Governor and the General Assembly, as provided in Section 3.1 of the General Assembly Organization Act. The plan shall include recommendations for:
            (A) a framework for collaborative, professional,
        	
innovative, and 21st century learning environments using the Evidence-Based Funding model;
            (B) ways to prepare and support this State's
        	
educators for successful instructional careers;
            (C) application and enhancement of the current
        	
financial accountability measures, the approved State plan to comply with the federal Every Student Succeeds Act, and the Illinois Balanced Accountability Measures in relation to student growth and elements of the Evidence-Based Funding model; and
            (D) implementation of an effective school
        	
adequacy funding system based on projected and recommended funding levels from the General Assembly.
        (11) On an annual basis, the State Superintendent
    	
must recalibrate all of the following per pupil elements of the Adequacy Target and applied to the formulas, based on the study of average expenses and as reported in the most recent annual financial report:
            (A) Gifted under subparagraph (M) of paragraph
        	
(2) of subsection (b).
            (B) Instructional materials under subparagraph
        	
(O) of paragraph (2) of subsection (b).
            (C) Assessment under subparagraph (P) of
        	
paragraph (2) of subsection (b).
            (D) Student activities under subparagraph (R) of

        (4) (Blank).
        (5) Within 5 years after the implementation of this
    	
Section, and every 5 years thereafter, the Panel shall complete an evaluative study of the entire Evidence-Based Funding model, including an assessment of whether or not the formula is achieving State goals. The Panel shall report to the State Board, the General Assembly, and the Governor on the findings of the study.
        (6) (Blank).
        (7) To ensure that (i) the Adequacy Target
    	
calculation under subsection (b) accurately reflects the needs of students living in poverty or attending schools located in areas of high poverty, (ii) racial equity within the Evidence-Based Funding formula is explicitly explored and advanced, and (iii) the funding goals of the formula distribution system established under this Section are sufficient to provide adequate funding for every student and to fully fund every school in this State, the Panel shall review the Essential Elements under paragraph (2) of subsection (b). The Panel shall consider all of the following in its review:
            (A) The financial ability of school districts to
        	
provide instruction in a foreign language to every student and whether an additional Essential Element should be added to the formula to ensure that every student has access to instruction in a foreign language.
            (B) The adult-to-student ratio for each Essential
        	
Element in which a ratio is identified. The Panel shall consider whether the ratio accurately reflects the staffing needed to support students living in poverty or who have traumatic backgrounds.
            (C) Changes to the Essential Elements that may be
        	
required to better promote racial equity and eliminate structural racism within schools.
            (D) The impact of investing $350,000,000 in
        	
additional funds each year under this Section and an estimate of when the school system will become fully funded under this level of appropriation.
            (E) Provide an overview of alternative funding
        	
structures that would enable the State to become fully funded at an earlier date.
            (F) The potential to increase efficiency and to
        	
find cost savings within the school system to expedite the journey to a fully funded system.
            (G) The appropriate levels for reenrolling and
        	
graduating high-risk high school students who have been previously out of school. These outcomes shall include enrollment, attendance, skill gains, credit gains, graduation or promotion to the next grade level, and the transition to college, training, or employment, with an emphasis on progressively increasing the overall attendance.
            (H) The evidence-based or research-based
        	
practices that are shown to reduce the gaps and disparities experienced by African American students in academic achievement and educational performance, including practices that have been shown to reduce parities in disciplinary rates, drop-out rates, graduation rates, college matriculation rates, and college completion rates.
        On or before December 31, 2021, the Panel shall
    	
report to the State Board, the General Assembly, and the Governor on the findings of its review. This paragraph (7) is inoperative on and after July 1, 2022.
    (j) References. Beginning July 1, 2017, references in other laws to general State aid funds or calculations under Section 18-8.05 of this Code (now repealed) shall be deemed to be references to evidence-based model formula funds or calculations under this Section.

    (105 ILCS 5/18-9) (from Ch. 122, par. 18-9)
    Sec. 18-9. Requirement for special equalization and supplementary State aid. If property comprising an aggregate assessed valuation equal to 6% or more of the total assessed valuation of all taxable property in a school district is owned by a person or corporation that is the subject of bankruptcy proceedings or that has been adjudged bankrupt and, as a result thereof, has not paid taxes on the property, then the district may amend its general State aid or evidence-based funding claim (i) back to the inception of the bankruptcy, not to exceed 6 years, in which time those taxes were not paid and (ii) for each succeeding year that those taxes remain unpaid, by adding to the claim an amount determined by multiplying the assessed valuation of the property on which taxes have not been paid due to the bankruptcy by the lesser of the total tax rate for the district for the tax year for which the taxes are unpaid or the applicable rate used in calculating the district's general State aid under paragraph (3) of subsection (D) of Section 18-8.05 of this Code or evidence-based funding under Section 18-8.15 of this Code, as applicable. If at any time a district that receives additional State aid under this Section receives tax revenue from the property for the years that taxes were not paid, the district's next claim for State aid shall be reduced in an amount equal to the taxes paid on the property, not to exceed the additional State aid received under this Section. Claims under this Section shall be filed on forms prescribed by the State Superintendent of Education, and the State Superintendent of Education, upon receipt of a claim, shall adjust the claim in accordance with the provisions of this Section. Supplementary State aid for each succeeding year under this Section shall be paid beginning with the first general State aid or evidence-based funding claim paid after the district has filed a completed claim in accordance with this Section.

    (a) With respect to payments for each fiscal year before fiscal year 2009, except payments for the period of June 1982 through July 1983 and payments for fiscal year 1994, as soon as may be after the 10th and 20th days of each of the months of August through the following July, if moneys are available in the common school fund in the State treasury for payments under Sections 18-8.05 through 18-9, the State Comptroller shall draw his warrants upon the State Treasurer as directed by the State Board of Education pursuant to Section 2-3.17b and in accordance with the transfers from the General Revenue Fund to the Common School Fund as specified in Section 8a of the State Finance Act.
    Each such semimonthly warrant shall be in an amount equal to 1/24 of the total amount to be distributed to school districts for the fiscal year. The amount of payments made in July of each year shall be considered as payments for claims covering the school year that commenced during the immediately preceding calendar year.

    (105 ILCS 5/18-12) (from Ch. 122, par. 18-12)
    Sec. 18-12. Dates for filing State aid claims. The school board of each school district, a regional office of education, a laboratory school, or a State-authorized charter school shall require teachers, principals, or superintendents to furnish from records kept by them such data as it needs in preparing and certifying to the State Superintendent of Education its report of claims provided in Section 18-8.05 or 18-8.15 of this Code. The claim shall be based on the latest available equalized assessed valuation and tax rates, as provided in Section 18-8.05 or 18-8.15, shall use the average daily attendance as determined by the method outlined in Section 18-8.05 or 18-8.15, and shall be certified and filed with the State Superintendent of Education by June 21 for districts and State-authorized charter schools with an official school calendar end date before June 15 or within 2 weeks following the official school calendar end date for districts, regional offices of education, laboratory schools, or State-authorized charter schools with a school year end date of June 15 or later. Failure to so file by these deadlines constitutes a forfeiture of the right to receive payment by the State until such claim is filed. The State Superintendent of Education shall voucher for payment those claims to the State Comptroller as provided in Section 18-11.
    Except as otherwise provided in this Section, if any school district fails to provide the minimum school term specified in Section 10-19, the State aid claim for that year shall be reduced by the State Superintendent of Education in an amount equivalent to 1/176 or .56818% for each day less than the number of days required by this Code.
    If the State Superintendent of Education determines that the failure to provide the minimum school term was occasioned by an act or acts of God, or was occasioned by conditions beyond the control of the school district which posed a hazardous threat to the health and safety of pupils, the State aid claim need not be reduced.
    If a school district is precluded from providing the minimum hours of instruction required for a full day of attendance due to (A) an adverse weather condition, (B) a condition beyond the control of the school district that poses a hazardous threat to the health and safety of students, or (C) beginning with the 2016-2017 school year, the utilization of the school district's facilities for not more than 2 school days per school year by local or county authorities for the purpose of holding a memorial or funeral services in remembrance of a community member, then the partial day of attendance may be counted if (i) the school district has provided at least one hour of instruction prior to the closure of the school district, (ii) a school building has provided at least one hour of instruction prior to the closure of the school building, or (iii) the normal start time of the school district is delayed.
    If, prior to providing any instruction, a school district must close one or more but not all school buildings after consultation with a local emergency response agency or due to a condition beyond the control of the school district, then the school district may claim attendance for up to 2 school days based on the average attendance of the 3 school days immediately preceding the closure of the affected school building or, if approved by the State Board of Education, utilize the provisions of an e-learning program for the affected school building as prescribed in Section 10-20.56 of this Code. The partial or no day of attendance described in this Section and the reasons therefore shall be certified within a month of the closing or delayed start by the school district superintendent to the regional superintendent of schools for forwarding to the State Superintendent of Education for approval.
    Other than the utilization of any e-learning days as prescribed in Section 10-20.56 of this Code, no exception to the requirement of providing a minimum school term may be approved by the State Superintendent of Education pursuant to this Section unless a school district has first used all emergency days provided for in its regular calendar.
    If the State Superintendent of Education declares that an energy shortage exists during any part of the school year for the State or a designated portion of the State, a district may operate the school attendance centers within the district 4 days of the week during the time of the shortage by extending each existing school day by one clock hour of school work, and the State aid claim shall not be reduced, nor shall the employees of that district suffer any reduction in salary or benefits as a result thereof. A district may operate all attendance centers on this revised schedule, or may apply the schedule to selected attendance centers, taking into consideration such factors as pupil transportation schedules and patterns and sources of energy for individual attendance centers.
    Electronically submitted State aid claims shall be submitted by duly authorized district individuals over a secure network that is password protected. The electronic submission of a State aid claim must be accompanied with an affirmation that all of the provisions of Section 18-8.05 or 18-8.15 and Sections 10-22.5 and 24-4 of this Code are met in all respects.

After consultation with a local health department, if a school district closes one or more recognized school buildings, but not all buildings, during a public health emergency, as determined by the State Board of Education in consultation with the Illinois Department of Public Health, the district may claim a full day of attendance for those days based on the average of the 3 school days of attendance immediately preceding the closure of the school building. Attendance for those days may be claimed only if the school building was scheduled to be in operation on those days. The partial or no day of attendance and the reasons thereof shall be certified, as prescribed by the State Board of Education, within a month after the closing by the school district superintendent to the regional superintendent of schools for forwarding to the State Superintendent of Education for approval.
    This Section is applicable beginning April 1, 2009 and only if a school district closes a building or buildings, but not the entire district, which must be done in accordance with Section 18-12 of this Code.

    Sec. 18-18. The board of education of any school district may borrow money by contracting or entering into loan agreements and may evidence such borrowings by the issuance of State aid anticipation certificates. Such certificates may be issued without submission to the electors of the school district or city for approval of the question of the issuance of such certificates. Such certificates shall bear interest or discount to maturity at a rate not to exceed the rate permissible for such board's full faith and credit general obligation notes and shall mature in such a manner so that no such certificates shall be outstanding for more than 13 months. State aid anticipation certificates shall be payable solely from payments to be made at any time, whether made before or after August 1, of any year, pursuant to this Article 18 and may be secured by assignment of such payments with the assignee receiving such payments directly from the State Superintendent of Education. Prior to the issuance of any such certificates the State Superintendent of Education shall certify the appropriated amount of State aid to be paid the district in the current fiscal year. The amount of certificates to be issued shall not exceed 75% of the amounts of State aid certified by the State Superintendent of Education after subtracting the amount of funds available for transfer from the district's working cash fund in anticipation of State aid to be paid such district pursuant to this Article 18. The amount of State aid anticipation certificates shall not be counted as indebtedness of the district for purposes of any debt limits nor are such certificates full faith and credit general obligation notes or tax anticipation warrants; provided, however, that the total amount of State aid anticipation certificates, general obligation notes and tax anticipation warrants outstanding for any fiscal year may not exceed 85% of the taxes levied by the district for that year.
    Any school district may borrow up to 100% of the amount of State aid to be received in July, as certified by the State Superintendent of Education. Such anticipation certificates shall be repaid not later than August 1 from State aid payments received in July.
    Whenever the board of a district desires to issue such State aid anticipation certificates as herein authorized, it shall adopt a resolution designating the purposes for which the proceeds of the certificates are to be expended and fixing the amount of the certificates proposed to be issued, the maturity thereof, and optional provisions, if any, and the rate of interest or discount to maturity thereon. Such resolution may provide for the appointment of a trustee, which may be any trust company or bank having the power of a trust company within the State, and for the establishment of such funds or accounts to be maintained by such trustee as the school district shall deem necessary to provide for the security and payment of the certificates. If such resolution provides for the appointment of a trustee, such trustee shall be considered the assignee of any payments assigned by the school district pursuant to such resolution and this Section. Any amounts paid by the State Superintendent of Education to such trustee as assignee pursuant to Section 18-11 shall be deposited in the funds or accounts established pursuant to such resolution, and shall be held by such trustee in trust for the benefit of the holders of the certificates, and such holders shall have a lien on and a security interest in such funds or accounts so long as the certificates remain outstanding and unpaid. Except as provided otherwise in this Section, such amounts shall be used solely for the payment of certificates at maturity and shall not be used for any other purpose so long as the certificates remain outstanding and unpaid. Pending such application such amounts shall be invested by such trustee in investments of the kind specified in the Public Funds Investment Act. Upon payment in full of the certificates, any amounts held by such trustee, including earnings on investments not used for payment of the certificates, shall be paid to such district.
    Said certificates shall be issued in the corporate name of the school district. They shall be signed by the president and secretary of said board. They shall be sold by the board upon such terms as may be approved by the board, and the proceeds thereof shall be received by the treasurer and expended by the board for the purposes provided in the resolution authorizing any such certificates.
    Upon the issuance of said certificates, the board shall give written notification to the appropriate regional superintendent and the State Superintendent of Education of the issuance of the certificates and the terms thereof, including, but not limited to, any assignment of State aid payments made pursuant to this Section, the name and address of each assignee, the amounts and dates of the payments to be made by the State Superintendent of Education directly to each assignee under Section 18-11, the amount of the certificates held by each assignee and the maturity date of the certificates.

DEBT LIMITATION

    (105 ILCS 5/19-1)
    Sec. 19-1. Debt limitations of school districts.
    (a) School districts shall not be subject to the provisions limiting their indebtedness prescribed in the Local Government Debt Limitation Act.
    No school districts maintaining grades K through 8 or 9 through 12 shall become indebted in any manner or for any purpose to an amount, including existing indebtedness, in the aggregate exceeding 6.9% on the value of the taxable property therein to be ascertained by the last assessment for State and county taxes or, until January 1, 1983, if greater, the sum that is produced by multiplying the school district's 1978 equalized assessed valuation by the debt limitation percentage in effect on January 1, 1979, previous to the incurring of such indebtedness.
    No school districts maintaining grades K through 12 shall become indebted in any manner or for any purpose to an amount, including existing indebtedness, in the aggregate exceeding 13.8% on the value of the taxable property therein to be ascertained by the last assessment for State and county taxes or, until January 1, 1983, if greater, the sum that is produced by multiplying the school district's 1978 equalized assessed valuation by the debt limitation percentage in effect on January 1, 1979, previous to the incurring of such indebtedness.
    No partial elementary unit district, as defined in Article 11E of this Code, shall become indebted in any manner or for any purpose in an amount, including existing indebtedness, in the aggregate exceeding 6.9% of the value of the taxable property of the entire district, to be ascertained by the last assessment for State and county taxes, plus an amount, including existing indebtedness, in the aggregate exceeding 6.9% of the value of the taxable property of that portion of the district included in the elementary and high school classification, to be ascertained by the last assessment for State and county taxes. Moreover, no partial elementary unit district, as defined in Article 11E of this Code, shall become indebted on account of bonds issued by the district for high school purposes in the aggregate exceeding 6.9% of the value of the taxable property of the entire district, to be ascertained by the last assessment for State and county taxes, nor shall the district become indebted on account of bonds issued by the district for elementary purposes in the aggregate exceeding 6.9% of the value of the taxable property for that portion of the district included in the elementary and high school classification, to be ascertained by the last assessment for State and county taxes.
    Notwithstanding the provisions of any other law to the contrary, in any case in which the voters of a school district have approved a proposition for the issuance of bonds of such school district at an election held prior to January 1, 1979, and all of the bonds approved at such election have not been issued, the debt limitation applicable to such school district during the calendar year 1979 shall be computed by multiplying the value of taxable property therein, including personal property, as ascertained by the last assessment for State and county taxes, previous to the incurring of such indebtedness, by the percentage limitation applicable to such school district under the provisions of this subsection (a).
    (a-5) After January 1, 2018, no school district may issue bonds under Sections 19-2 through 19-7 of this Code and rely on an exception to the debt limitations in this Section unless it has complied with the requirements of Section 21 of the Bond Issue Notification Act and the bonds have been approved by referendum.
    (b) Notwithstanding the debt limitation prescribed in subsection (a) of this Section, additional indebtedness may be incurred in an amount not to exceed the estimated cost of acquiring or improving school sites or constructing and equipping additional building facilities under the following conditions:
        (1) Whenever the enrollment of students for the next
    	
school year is estimated by the board of education to increase over the actual present enrollment by not less than 35% or by not less than 200 students or the actual present enrollment of students has increased over the previous school year by not less than 35% or by not less than 200 students and the board of education determines that additional school sites or building facilities are required as a result of such increase in enrollment; and
        (2) When the Regional Superintendent of Schools
    	
having jurisdiction over the school district and the State Superintendent of Education concur in such enrollment projection or increase and approve the need for such additional school sites or building facilities and the estimated cost thereof; and
        (3) When the voters in the school district approve a
    	
proposition for the issuance of bonds for the purpose of acquiring or improving such needed school sites or constructing and equipping such needed additional building facilities at an election called and held for that purpose. Notice of such an election shall state that the amount of indebtedness proposed to be incurred would exceed the debt limitation otherwise applicable to the school district. The ballot for such proposition shall state what percentage of the equalized assessed valuation will be outstanding in bonds if the proposed issuance of bonds is approved by the voters; or
        (4) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs (1)
    	
through (3) of this subsection (b), if the school board determines that additional facilities are needed to provide a quality educational program and not less than 2/3 of those voting in an election called by the school board on the question approve the issuance of bonds for the construction of such facilities, the school district may issue bonds for this purpose; or
        (5) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs (1)
    	
through (3) of this subsection (b), if (i) the school district has previously availed itself of the provisions of paragraph (4) of this subsection (b) to enable it to issue bonds, (ii) the voters of the school district have not defeated a proposition for the issuance of bonds since the referendum described in paragraph (4) of this subsection (b) was held, (iii) the school board determines that additional facilities are needed to provide a quality educational program, and (iv) a majority of those voting in an election called by the school board on the question approve the issuance of bonds for the construction of such facilities, the school district may issue bonds for this purpose.
    In no event shall the indebtedness incurred pursuant to this subsection (b) and the existing indebtedness of the school district exceed 15% of the value of the taxable property therein to be ascertained by the last assessment for State and county taxes, previous to the incurring of such indebtedness or, until January 1, 1983, if greater, the sum that is produced by multiplying the school district's 1978 equalized assessed valuation by the debt limitation percentage in effect on January 1, 1979.
    The indebtedness provided for by this subsection (b) shall be in addition to and in excess of any other debt limitation.
    (c) Notwithstanding the debt limitation prescribed in subsection (a) of this Section, in any case in which a public question for the issuance of bonds of a proposed school district maintaining grades kindergarten through 12 received at least 60% of the valid ballots cast on the question at an election held on or prior to November 8, 1994, and in which the bonds approved at such election have not been issued, the school district pursuant to the requirements of Section 11A-10 (now repealed) may issue the total amount of bonds approved at such election for the purpose stated in the question.
    (d) Notwithstanding the debt limitation prescribed in subsection (a) of this Section, a school district that meets all the criteria set forth in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subsection (d) may incur an additional indebtedness in an amount not to exceed $4,500,000, even though the amount of the additional indebtedness authorized by this subsection (d), when incurred and added to the aggregate amount of indebtedness of the district existing immediately prior to the district incurring the additional indebtedness authorized by this subsection (d), causes the aggregate indebtedness of the district to exceed the debt limitation otherwise applicable to that district under subsection (a):
        (1) The additional indebtedness authorized by this
    	
subsection (d) is incurred by the school district through the issuance of bonds under and in accordance with Section 17-2.11a for the purpose of replacing a school building which, because of mine subsidence damage, has been closed as provided in paragraph (2) of this subsection (d) or through the issuance of bonds under and in accordance with Section 19-3 for the purpose of increasing the size of, or providing for additional functions in, such replacement school buildings, or both such purposes.
        (2) The bonds issued by the school district as
    	
provided in paragraph (1) above are issued for the purposes of construction by the school district of a new school building pursuant to Section 17-2.11, to replace an existing school building that, because of mine subsidence damage, is closed as of the end of the 1992-93 school year pursuant to action of the regional superintendent of schools of the educational service region in which the district is located under Section 3-14.22 or are issued for the purpose of increasing the size of, or providing for additional functions in, the new school building being constructed to replace a school building closed as the result of mine subsidence damage, or both such purposes.
    (e) (Blank).
    (f) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (a) of this Section or of any other law, bonds in not to exceed the aggregate amount of $5,500,000 and issued by a school district meeting the following criteria shall not be considered indebtedness for purposes of any statutory limitation and may be issued in an amount or amounts, including existing indebtedness, in excess of any heretofore or hereafter imposed statutory limitation as to indebtedness:
        (1) At the time of the sale of such bonds, the board
    	
of education of the district shall have determined by resolution that the enrollment of students in the district is projected to increase by not less than 7% during each of the next succeeding 2 school years.
        (2) The board of education shall also determine by
    	
resolution that the improvements to be financed with the proceeds of the bonds are needed because of the projected enrollment increases.
        (3) The board of education shall also determine by
    	
resolution that the projected increases in enrollment are the result of improvements made or expected to be made to passenger rail facilities located in the school district.
    Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (a) of this Section or of any other law, a school district that has availed itself of the provisions of this subsection (f) prior to July 22, 2004 (the effective date of Public Act 93-799) may also issue bonds approved by referendum up to an amount, including existing indebtedness, not exceeding 25% of the equalized assessed value of the taxable property in the district if all of the conditions set forth in items (1), (2), and (3) of this subsection (f) are met.
    (g) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (a) of this Section or any other law, bonds in not to exceed an aggregate amount of 25% of the equalized assessed value of the taxable property of a school district and issued by a school district meeting the criteria in paragraphs (i) through (iv) of this subsection shall not be considered indebtedness for purposes of any statutory limitation and may be issued pursuant to resolution of the school board in an amount or amounts, including existing indebtedness, in excess of any statutory limitation of indebtedness heretofore or hereafter imposed:
        (i) The bonds are issued for the purpose of
    	
constructing a new high school building to replace two adjacent existing buildings which together house a single high school, each of which is more than 65 years old, and which together are located on more than 10 acres and less than 11 acres of property.
        (ii) At the time the resolution authorizing the
    	
issuance of the bonds is adopted, the cost of constructing a new school building to replace the existing school building is less than 60% of the cost of repairing the existing school building.
        (iii) The sale of the bonds occurs before July 1,
    	
1997.
        (iv) The school district issuing the bonds is a unit

    (h) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Section or the provisions of any other law, until January 1, 1998, a community unit school district maintaining grades K through 12 may issue bonds up to an amount, including existing indebtedness, not exceeding 27.6% of the equalized assessed value of the taxable property in the district, if all of the following conditions are met:

The evaluation shall analyze the estimates of all costs of installations, modifications or remodeling, including, without limitation, costs of a pre-installation energy audit or analysis, design, engineering, installation, maintenance, repairs, debt service, conversions to a different energy or fuel source, or post-installation project monitoring, data collection, and reporting. The evaluation shall include a detailed analysis of whether either the energy consumed or the operating costs, or both, will be reduced. If technical assistance is not available by a licensed architect or registered professional engineer on the school district or area vocational center staff, then the evaluation of the proposal shall be done by a registered professional engineer or architect, who is retained by the school district or area vocational center. A licensed architect or registered professional engineer evaluating a proposal under this Section must not have any financial or contractual relationship with a qualified provider or other source that would constitute a conflict of interest. The school district or area vocational center may pay a reasonable fee for evaluation of the proposal or include the fee as part of the payments made under Section 19b-4.

    Sec. 20-1. Authority to create working cash fund. In each school district, whether organized under general law or special charter, having a population of less than 500,000 inhabitants, a fund to be known as a "Working Cash Fund" may be created and maintained consistent with the limitations of this Article, for the purpose of enabling the district to have in its treasury at all times sufficient money to meet demands thereon for expenditures for corporate purposes.
(Source: P.A. 98-756, eff. 7-16-14.)

    (105 ILCS 5/20-2) (from Ch. 122, par. 20-2)
    Sec. 20-2. Indebtedness and bonds. For the purpose of creating, re-creating, or increasing a working cash fund, the school board of any such district may incur an indebtedness and issue bonds as evidence thereof in an amount or amounts not exceeding in the aggregate 85% of the taxes permitted to be levied for educational purposes for the then current year to be determined by multiplying the maximum educational tax rate or rates applicable to such school district by the last assessed valuation or assessed valuations as determined at the time of the issue of said bonds, plus 85% of the last known entitlement of such district to taxes as by law now or hereafter enacted or amended, imposed by the General Assembly of the State of Illinois to replace revenue lost by units of local government and school districts as a result of the abolition of ad valorem personal property taxes, pursuant to Article IX, Section 5, paragraph (c) of the Constitution of the State of Illinois, plus 85% of the most recent amount of funding received by the school district under Section 18-8.15. The bonds shall bear interest at not more than the maximum rate authorized by law and shall mature within 20 years from the date thereof. Subject to the foregoing limitations as to amount, the bonds may be issued in an amount including existing indebtedness which will not exceed the constitutional limitation as to debt, notwithstanding any statutory debt limitation to the contrary. The school board shall before or at the time of issuing the bonds provide for the collection of a direct annual tax upon all the taxable property within the district sufficient to pay the principal thereof at maturity and to pay the interest thereon as it falls due, which tax shall be in addition to the maximum amount of all other taxes, either educational; transportation; operations and maintenance; or fire prevention and safety fund taxes, now or hereafter authorized and in addition to any limitations upon the levy of taxes as provided by Sections 17-2 through 17-9.
    With respect to instruments for the payment of money issued under this Section either before, on, or after the effective date of this amendatory Act of 1989, it is and always has been the intention of the General Assembly (i) that the Omnibus Bond Acts are and always have been supplementary grants of power to issue instruments in accordance with the Omnibus Bond Acts, regardless of any provision of this Act that may appear to be or to have been more restrictive than those Acts, (ii) that the provisions of this Section are not a limitation on the supplementary authority granted by the Omnibus Bond Acts, and (iii) that instruments issued under this Section within the supplementary authority granted by the Omnibus Bond Acts are not invalid because of any provision of this Act that may appear to be or to have been more restrictive than those Acts.

The collection of the tax shall not be anticipated by the issuance of any warrants drawn against it. The tax shall be levied and collected, except as otherwise provided in this Section, in like manner as the general taxes of the district, and shall be in addition to the maximum of all other taxes, either educational; transportation; operations and maintenance; or fire prevention and safety fund taxes, now or hereafter to be levied for school purposes. It may be levied by separate resolution by the last Tuesday in December in each year or it may be included in the certificate of tax levy filed under Section 17-11.

    Moneys derived from the issuance of bonds as authorized by Section 20-2, or from any tax levied pursuant to Section 20-3, shall be used only for the purposes and in the manner provided in this Article. Moneys in the fund shall not be regarded as current assets available for school purposes. The school board may appropriate moneys to the working cash fund up to the maximum amount allowable in the fund, and the working cash fund may receive such appropriations and any other contributions. Moneys in the fund may be used by the school board for any and all school purposes and may be transferred in whole or in part to the general funds or both of the school district and disbursed therefrom in anticipation of the collection of taxes lawfully levied for any or all purposes, in anticipation of such taxes as by law now or hereafter enacted or amended are imposed by the General Assembly of the State of Illinois to replace revenue lost by units of local government and school districts as a result of the abolition of ad valorem personal property taxes, pursuant to Article IX, Section 5(c) of the Constitution of the State of Illinois, or in anticipation of funding received by the school district under Section 18-8.15. Moneys so transferred to any other fund shall be deemed to be transferred in anticipation of the collection of that part of the taxes so levied or to be received which is in excess of the amount thereof required to pay any warrants or notes and the interest thereon theretofore and thereafter issued in anticipation of the collection thereof and such taxes when collected shall be applied to the payment of any such warrants and the interest thereon, the amount estimated to be required to satisfy debt service and pension or retirement obligations, as set forth in Section 12 of the State Revenue Sharing Act and then to the reimbursement of such working cash fund as hereinafter provided.
    Upon receipt by the school district of any taxes or State funding in anticipation of the collection whereof moneys of the working cash fund have been so transferred for disbursement, the fund shall immediately be reimbursed therefrom until the full amount so transferred has been retransferred to the fund. Unless the taxes so received and applied to the reimbursement of the working cash fund prior to the first day of the eighth month following the month in which due and unpaid real property taxes begin to bear interest are sufficient to effect a complete reimbursement of such fund for any moneys transferred therefrom in anticipation of the collection of such taxes, the working cash fund shall be reimbursed for the amount of the deficiency therein from any other revenues accruing to the educational fund, and the school board shall make provisions for the immediate reimbursement of the amount of any such deficiency in its next annual tax levy.

    Moneys in the working cash fund shall be transferred from the working cash fund to another fund of the district only upon the authority of the school board which shall from time to time by separate resolution direct the school treasurer to make transfers of such sums as may be required for the purposes herein authorized.
    The resolution shall set forth (a) the taxes and State funding in anticipation of which such transfer is to be made and from which the working cash fund is to be reimbursed; (b) the entire amount of taxes extended, or which the school board estimates will be extended or received, for any year in anticipation of the collection of all or part of which such transfer is to be made; (c) the aggregate amount of warrants or notes theretofore issued in anticipation of the collection of such taxes together with the amount of interest accrued and which the school board estimates will accrue thereon; (d) the aggregate amount of receipts from taxes imposed to replace revenue lost by units of local government and school districts as a result of the abolition of ad valorem personal property taxes, pursuant to Article IX, Section 5(c) of the Constitution of the State of Illinois, which the corporate authorities estimate will be set aside for the payment of the proportionate amount of debt service and pension or retirement obligations, as required by Section 12 of the State Revenue Sharing Act; (e) the aggregate amount of money theretofore transferred from the working cash fund to the other fund in anticipation of the collection of such taxes and State funding; and (f) the aggregate amount of funding received by the school district under Section 18-8.15. The amount which any such resolution shall direct the treasurer so to transfer, in anticipation of the collection of taxes levied or to be received for any year, together with the aggregate amount of such anticipation tax warrants or notes theretofore drawn against such taxes and the amount of interest accrued and estimated to accrue thereon and the aggregate amount of such transfers to be made in anticipation of the collection of such taxes and the amount estimated to be required to satisfy debt service and pension or retirement obligations, as set forth in Section 12 of the State Revenue Sharing Act, shall not exceed 85% of the actual or estimated amount of such taxes extended or to be extended or to be received as set forth in such resolution. At any time moneys are available in the working cash fund they shall be transferred to such other funds of the district and used for any and all school purposes so as to avoid, whenever possible, the issuance of anticipation tax warrants or notes.
    Moneys earned as interest from the investment of the working cash fund, or any portion thereof, may be transferred from the working cash fund to another fund of the district that is most in need of the interest without any requirement of repayment to the working cash fund, upon the authority of the school board by separate resolution directing the school treasurer to make such transfer and stating the purpose in accordance with subsection (c) of Section 9 of the Local Government Debt Reform Act.

    Sec. 21-5e. Alternative Route to Administrative Certification for National Board Certified Teachers.
    (a) It shall be the policy of the State of Illinois to improve the recruitment and preparation of instructional leaders.
    (b) On or before July 1, 2007, the State Board of Education, in consultation with the State Teacher Certification Board, may establish and implement one or more alternative route to administrative certification for teacher leaders, to be known as the Alternative Route to an Administrative Certificate for National Board Certified Teachers. "Teacher leader" means a certified teacher who has already received National Board certification through the National Board for Professional Teaching Standards and who has a teacher leader endorsement under Section 21-7.5 of this Code. Persons who meet the requirements of and successfully complete a program established by this Section shall be issued a standard administrative certificate for serving in schools in this State. The State Board may approve a course of study that persons must successfully complete in order to satisfy one criterion for issuance of the administrative certificate under this Section. The Alternative Route to an Administrative Certificate for National Board Certified Teachers must include content and skills contained in the Illinois Professional School Leader Standards for State certification, with the exception of content and skills that a candidate has already demonstrated meeting through National Board certification or through a teacher leadership master's degree program.
    (c) The Alternative Route to an Administrative Certificate for National Board Certified Teachers shall be comprised of the following 4 phases:
        (1) National Board certification and an endorsement
    	
in teacher leadership in accordance with Section 21-7.5 of this Code;
        (2) a master's degree in a teacher leader program;
        (3) 15 hours of coursework in which the candidate
    	
must show evidence of meeting competencies for organizational management and development, finance, supervision and evaluation, policy and legal issues, and leadership, as stated in the Illinois Professional School Leader Standards for principals; and
        (4) a passing score on the Illinois Administrator
    	
Assessment.
    (d) Successful completion of the Alternative Route to an Administrative Certificate for National Board Certified Teachers shall be deemed to satisfy all requirements to receive an administrative certificate established by law. The State Board shall adopt rules that are consistent with this Section and that the State Board deems necessary for the establishment and implementation of the program.

    Sec. 21A-5. Definitions. In this Article:
    "New teacher" means the holder of a professional educator license, as set forth in Section 21B-20 of this Code, who is employed by a public school and who has not previously participated in a new teacher induction and mentoring program required by this Article, except as provided in Section 21A-25 of this Code.
    "Public school" means any school operating pursuant to the authority of this Code, including without limitation a school district, a charter school, a cooperative or joint agreement with a governing body or board of control, and a school operated by a regional office of education or State agency.

    Sec. 21A-10. Development of program required. During the 2003-2004 school year, each public school or 2 or more public schools acting jointly shall develop, in conjunction with its exclusive representative or their exclusive representatives, if any, a new teacher induction and mentoring program that meets the requirements set forth in Section 21A-20 of this Code to assist new teachers in developing the skills and strategies necessary for instructional excellence, provided that funding is made available by the State Board of Education from an appropriation made for this purpose. A public school that has an existing induction and mentoring program that does not meet the requirements set forth in Section 21A-20 of this Code may have school years 2003-2004 and 2004-2005 to develop a program that does meet those requirements and may receive funding as described in Section 21A-25 of this Code, provided that the funding is made available by the State Board of Education from an appropriation made for this purpose. A public school with such an existing induction and mentoring program may receive funding for the 2005-2006 school year for each new teacher in the second year of a 2-year program that does not meet the requirements set forth in Section 21A-20, as long as the public school has established the required new program by the beginning of that school year as described in Section 21A-15 and provided that funding is made available by the State Board of Education from an appropriation made for this purpose as described in Section 21A-25.

a period of at least 2 school years.
        (2) Aligns with the Illinois Professional Teaching
    	
Standards, content area standards, and applicable local school improvement and professional development plans, if any.
        (3) Addresses all of the following elements and how
    	
they will be provided:
            (A) Mentoring and support of the new teacher.
            (B) Professional development specifically
        	
designed to ensure the growth of the new teacher's knowledge and skills.
            (C) Formative assessment designed to ensure
        	
feedback and reflection, which must not be used in any evaluation of the new teacher.
        (4) Describes the role of mentor teachers, the
    	
criteria and process for their selection, and how they will be trained, provided that each mentor teacher shall demonstrate the best practices in teaching his or her respective field of practice. A mentor teacher may not directly or indirectly participate in the evaluation of a new teacher pursuant to Article 24A of this Code or the evaluation procedure of the public school.

    (105 ILCS 5/21A-25)
    Sec. 21A-25. Funding. From a separate appropriation made for the purposes of this Article, for each new teacher participating in a new teacher induction and mentoring program that meets the requirements set forth in Section 21A-20 of this Code or in an existing program that is in the process of transition to a program that meets those requirements, the State Board of Education shall pay the public school $1,200 annually for each of 2 school years for the purpose of providing one or more of the following:
        (1) Mentor teacher compensation.
        (2) Mentor teacher training or new teacher training
    	
or both.
        (3) Release time.
However, if a new teacher, after participating in the new teacher induction and mentoring program for one school year, becomes employed by another public school, the State Board of Education shall pay the teacher's new school $1,200 for the second school year and the teacher shall continue to be a new teacher as defined in this Article. Each public school shall determine, in conjunction with its exclusive representative, if any, how the $1,200 per school year for each new teacher shall be used, provided that if a mentor teacher receives additional release time to support a new teacher, the total workload of other teachers regularly employed by the public school shall not increase in any substantial manner. If the appropriation is insufficient to cover the $1,200 per school year for each new teacher, public schools are not required to develop or implement the program established by this Article. In the event of an insufficient appropriation, a public school or 2 or more schools acting jointly may submit an application for a grant administered by the State Board of Education and awarded on a competitive basis to establish a new teacher induction and mentoring program that meets the criteria set forth in Section 21A-20 of this Code. The State Board of Education may retain up to $1,000,000 of the appropriation for new teacher induction and mentoring programs to train mentor teachers, administrators, and other personnel, to provide best practices information, and to conduct an evaluation of these programs' impact and effectiveness.

    Sec. 21B-15. Qualifications of educators.
    (a) No one may be licensed to teach or supervise or be otherwise employed in the public schools of this State who is not of good character and at least 19 years of age.
    In determining good character under this Section, the State Superintendent of Education shall take into consideration the disciplinary actions of other states or national entities against certificates or licenses issued by those states and held by individuals from those states. In addition, any felony conviction of the applicant may be taken into consideration; however, no one may be licensed to teach or supervise in the public schools of this State who has been convicted of (i) an offense set forth in subsection (b) of Section 21B-80 of this Code until 7 years following the end of the sentence for the criminal offense or (ii) an offense set forth in subsection (c) of Section 21B-80 of this Code. Unless the conviction is for an offense set forth in Section 21B-80 of this Code, an applicant must be permitted to submit character references or other written material before such a conviction or other information regarding the applicant's character may be used by the State Superintendent of Education as a basis for denying the application.
    (b) No person otherwise qualified shall be denied the right to be licensed or to receive training for the purpose of becoming an educator because of a physical disability, including, but not limited to, visual and hearing disabilities; nor shall any school district refuse to employ a teacher on such grounds, provided that the person is able to carry out the duties of the position for which he or she applies.
    (c) No person may be granted or continue to hold an educator license who has knowingly altered or misrepresented his or her qualifications, in this State or any other state, in order to acquire or renew the license. Any other license issued under this Article held by the person may be suspended or revoked by the State Educator Preparation and Licensure Board, depending upon the severity of the alteration or misrepresentation.
    (d) No one may teach or supervise in the public schools nor receive for teaching or supervising any part of any public school fund who does not hold an educator license granted by the State Superintendent of Education as provided in this Article. However, the provisions of this Article do not apply to a member of the armed forces who is employed as a teacher of subjects in the Reserve Officers' Training Corps of any school, nor to an individual teaching a dual credit course as provided for in the Dual Credit Quality Act.
    (e) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Code, the school board of a school district may grant to a teacher of the district a leave of absence with full pay for a period of not more than one year to permit the teacher to teach in a foreign state under the provisions of the Exchange Teacher Program established under Public Law 584, 79th Congress, and Public Law 402, 80th Congress, as amended. The school board granting the leave of absence may employ, with or without pay, a national of the foreign state wherein the teacher on the leave of absence is to teach if the national is qualified to teach in that foreign state and if that national is to teach in a grade level similar to the one that was taught in the foreign state. The State Board of Education, in consultation with the State Educator Preparation and Licensure Board, may adopt rules as may be necessary to implement this subsection (e).
    (f) No person shall be denied a license issued under this Article solely based on his or her citizenship status or immigration status.

Nothing in this subsection shall affect the requirements to obtain a license that are not directly related to citizenship status or immigration status. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to grant eligibility for obtaining any public benefit other than a license issued under this Article.

holds a valid Professional Educator License or Educator License with Stipulations to seek or hold a Substitute Teaching License to teach as a substitute teacher.

        Short-Term Substitute Teaching Licenses are valid for
    	
substitute teaching in every county of this State. If an individual has had his or her Professional Educator License or Educator License with Stipulations suspended or revoked, then that individual is not eligible to obtain a Short-Term Substitute Teaching License.
        The provisions of Sections 10-21.9 and 34-18.5 of
    	
this Code apply to short-term substitute teachers.
        An individual holding a Short-Term Substitute

The tests must be designed to be racially neutral to ensure that no person taking the tests is discriminated against on the basis of race, color, national origin, or other factors unrelated to the person's ability to perform as a licensed employee. The score required to pass the tests shall be fixed by the State Board of Education, in consultation with the State Educator Preparation and Licensure Board. The tests shall be administered not fewer than 3 times a year at such time and place as may be designated by the State Board of Education, in consultation with the State Educator Preparation and Licensure Board.
    The State Board shall implement a test or tests to assess the speaking, reading, writing, and grammar skills of applicants for an endorsement or a license issued under subdivision (G) of paragraph (2) of Section 21B-20 of this Code in the English language and in the language of the transitional bilingual education program requested by the applicant.
    (h) Except as provided in Section 34-6 of this Code, the provisions of this Section shall apply equally in any school district subject to Article 34 of this Code.
    (i) The rules developed to implement and enforce the testing requirements under this Section shall include without limitation provisions governing test selection, test validation and determination of a passing score, administration of the tests, frequency of administration, applicant fees, frequency of applicants taking the tests, the years for which a score is valid, and appropriate special accommodations. The State Board of Education shall develop such rules as may be needed to ensure uniformity from year to year in the level of difficulty for each form of an assessment.

    Sec. 21B-45. Professional Educator License renewal.
    (a) Individuals holding a Professional Educator License are required to complete the licensure renewal requirements as specified in this Section, unless otherwise provided in this Code.
    Individuals holding a Professional Educator License shall meet the renewal requirements set forth in this Section, unless otherwise provided in this Code. If an individual holds a license endorsed in more than one area that has different renewal requirements, that individual shall follow the renewal requirements for the position for which he or she spends the majority of his or her time working.
    (b) All Professional Educator Licenses not renewed as provided in this Section shall lapse on September 1 of that year. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Section, if a license holder's electronic mail address is available, the State Board of Education shall send him or her notification electronically that his or her license will lapse if not renewed, to be sent no more than 6 months prior to the license lapsing. Lapsed licenses may be immediately reinstated upon (i) payment by the applicant of a $500 penalty to the State Board of Education or (ii) the demonstration of proficiency by completing 9 semester hours of coursework from a regionally accredited institution of higher education in the content area that most aligns with one or more of the educator's endorsement areas. Any and all back fees, including without limitation registration fees owed from the time of expiration of the license until the date of reinstatement, shall be paid and kept in accordance with the provisions in Article 3 of this Code concerning an institute fund and the provisions in Article 21B of this Code concerning fees and requirements for registration. Licenses not registered in accordance with Section 21B-40 of this Code shall lapse after a period of 6 months from the expiration of the last year of registration or on January 1 of the fiscal year following initial issuance of the license. An unregistered license is invalid after September 1 for employment and performance of services in an Illinois public or State-operated school or cooperative and in a charter school. Any license or endorsement may be voluntarily surrendered by the license holder. A voluntarily surrendered license shall be treated as a revoked license. An Educator License with Stipulations with only a paraprofessional endorsement does not lapse.
    (c) From July 1, 2013 through June 30, 2014, in order to satisfy the requirements for licensure renewal provided for in this Section, each professional educator licensee with an administrative endorsement who is working in a position requiring such endorsement shall complete one Illinois Administrators' Academy course, as described in Article 2 of this Code, per fiscal year.
    (c-5) All licenses issued by the State Board of Education under this Article that expire on June 30, 2020 and have not been renewed by the end of the 2020 renewal period shall be extended for one year and shall expire on June 30, 2021.
    (d) Beginning July 1, 2014, in order to satisfy the requirements for licensure renewal provided for in this Section, each professional educator licensee may create a professional development plan each year. The plan shall address one or more of the endorsements that are required of his or her educator position if the licensee is employed and performing services in an Illinois public or State-operated school or cooperative. If the licensee is employed in a charter school, the plan shall address that endorsement or those endorsements most closely related to his or her educator position. Licensees employed and performing services in any other Illinois schools may participate in the renewal requirements by adhering to the same process.
    Except as otherwise provided in this Section, the licensee's professional development activities shall align with one or more of the following criteria:
        (1) activities are of a type that engage participants
    	
over a sustained period of time allowing for analysis, discovery, and application as they relate to student learning, social or emotional achievement, or well-being;
        (2) professional development aligns to the licensee's
    	
performance;
        (3) outcomes for the activities must relate to
    	
student growth or district improvement;
        (4) activities align to State-approved standards; and
        (5) higher education coursework.
    (e) For each renewal cycle, each professional educator licensee shall engage in professional development activities. Prior to renewal, the licensee shall enter electronically into the Educator Licensure Information System (ELIS) the name, date, and location of the activity, the number of professional development hours, and the provider's name. The following provisions shall apply concerning professional development activities:
        (1) Each licensee shall complete a total of 120 hours
    	
of professional development per 5-year renewal cycle in order to renew the license, except as otherwise provided in this Section.
        (2) Beginning with his or her first full 5-year
    	
cycle, any licensee with an administrative endorsement who is not working in a position requiring such endorsement is not required to complete Illinois Administrators' Academy courses, as described in Article 2 of this Code. Such licensees must complete one Illinois Administrators' Academy course within one year after returning to a position that requires the administrative endorsement.
        (3) Any licensee with an administrative endorsement
    	
who is working in a position requiring such endorsement or an individual with a Teacher Leader endorsement serving in an administrative capacity at least 50% of the day shall complete one Illinois Administrators' Academy course, as described in Article 2 of this Code, each fiscal year in addition to 100 hours of professional development per 5-year renewal cycle in accordance with this Code.
        (4) Any licensee holding a current National Board for
    	
Professional Teaching Standards (NBPTS) master teacher designation shall complete a total of 60 hours of professional development per 5-year renewal cycle in order to renew the license.
        (5) Licensees working in a position that does not

        (6) Licensees who are retired and qualify for
    	
benefits from a State of Illinois retirement system shall notify the State Board of Education using ELIS, and the license shall be maintained in retired status. For any renewal cycle in which a licensee retires during the renewal cycle, the licensee must complete professional development activities on a prorated basis depending on the number of years during the renewal cycle the educator held an active license. If a licensee retires during a renewal cycle, the licensee must notify the State Board of Education using ELIS that the licensee wishes to maintain the license in retired status and must show proof of completion of professional development activities on a prorated basis for all years of that renewal cycle for which the license was active. An individual with a license in retired status shall not be required to complete professional development activities or pay registration fees until returning to a position that requires educator licensure. Upon returning to work in a position that requires the Professional Educator License, the licensee shall immediately pay a registration fee and complete renewal requirements for that year. A license in retired status cannot lapse. Beginning on January 6, 2017 (the effective date of Public Act 99-920) through December 31, 2017, any licensee who has retired and whose license has lapsed for failure to renew as provided in this Section may reinstate that license and maintain it in retired status upon providing proof to the State Board of Education using ELIS that the licensee is retired and is not working in a position that requires a Professional Educator License.
        (7) For any renewal cycle in which professional
    	
development hours were required, but not fulfilled, the licensee shall complete any missed hours to total the minimum professional development hours required in this Section prior to September 1 of that year. Professional development hours used to fulfill the minimum required hours for a renewal cycle may be used for only one renewal cycle. For any fiscal year or renewal cycle in which an Illinois Administrators' Academy course was required but not completed, the licensee shall complete any missed Illinois Administrators' Academy courses prior to September 1 of that year. The licensee may complete all deficient hours and Illinois Administrators' Academy courses while continuing to work in a position that requires that license until September 1 of that year.
        (8) Any licensee who has not fulfilled the
    	
professional development renewal requirements set forth in this Section at the end of any 5-year renewal cycle is ineligible to register his or her license and may submit an appeal to the State Superintendent of Education for reinstatement of the license.
        (9) If professional development opportunities were
    	
unavailable to a licensee, proof that opportunities were unavailable and request for an extension of time beyond August 31 to complete the renewal requirements may be submitted from April 1 through June 30 of that year to the State Educator Preparation and Licensure Board. If an extension is approved, the license shall remain valid during the extension period.
        (10) Individuals who hold exempt licenses prior to
    	
December 27, 2013 (the effective date of Public Act 98-610) shall commence the annual renewal process with the first scheduled registration due after December 27, 2013 (the effective date of Public Act 98-610).
        (11) Notwithstanding any other provision of this
    	
subsection (e), if a licensee earns more than the required number of professional development hours during a renewal cycle, then the licensee may carry over any hours earned from April 1 through June 30 of the last year of the renewal cycle. Any hours carried over in this manner must be applied to the next renewal cycle. Illinois Administrators' Academy courses or hours earned in those courses may not be carried over.
    (f) At the time of renewal, each licensee shall respond to the required questions under penalty of perjury.
    (f-5) The State Board of Education shall conduct random audits of licensees to verify a licensee's fulfillment of the professional development hours required under this Section. Upon completion of a random audit, if it is determined by the State Board of Education that the licensee did not complete the required number of professional development hours or did not provide sufficient proof of completion, the licensee shall be notified that his or her license has lapsed. A license that has lapsed under this subsection may be reinstated as provided in subsection (b).

    Sec. 21B-50. Alternative Educator Licensure Program.
    (a) There is established an alternative educator licensure program, to be known as the Alternative Educator Licensure Program for Teachers.

    The program shall be comprised of 4 phases:
        (1) A course of study that at a minimum includes
    	
instructional planning; instructional strategies, including special education, reading, and English language learning; classroom management; and the assessment of students and use of data to drive instruction.
        (2) A year of residency, which is a candidate's
    	
assignment to a full-time teaching position or as a co-teacher for one full school year. An individual must hold an Educator License with Stipulations with an alternative provisional educator endorsement in order to enter the residency and must complete additional program requirements that address required State and national standards, pass the State Board's teacher performance assessment no later than the end of the first semester of the second year of residency, as required under phase (3) of this subsection (b), and be recommended by the principal or qualified equivalent of a principal, as required under subsection (d) of this Section, and the program coordinator to continue with the second year of the residency.
        (3) A second year of residency, which shall include
    	
the candidate's assignment to a full-time teaching position for one school year. The candidate must be assigned an experienced teacher to act as a mentor and coach the candidate through the second year of residency.
        (4) A comprehensive assessment of the candidate's
    	
teaching effectiveness, as evaluated by the principal or qualified equivalent of a principal, as required under subsection (d) of this Section, and the program coordinator, at the end of the second year of residency. If there is disagreement between the 2 evaluators about the candidate's teaching effectiveness, the candidate may complete one additional year of residency teaching under a professional development plan developed by the principal or qualified equivalent and the preparation program. At the completion of the third year, a candidate must have positive evaluations and a recommendation for full licensure from both the principal or qualified equivalent and the program coordinator or no Professional Educator License shall be issued.
    Successful completion of the program shall be deemed to satisfy any other practice or student teaching and content matter requirements established by law.
    (c) An alternative provisional educator endorsement on an Educator License with Stipulations is valid for 2 years of teaching in the public schools, including without limitation a preschool educational program under Section 2-3.71 of this Code or charter school, or in a State-recognized nonpublic school in which the chief administrator is required to have the licensure necessary to be a principal in a public school in this State and in which a majority of the teachers are required to have the licensure necessary to be instructors in a public school in this State, but may be renewed for a third year if needed to complete the Alternative Educator Licensure Program for Teachers. The endorsement shall be issued only once to an individual who meets all of the following requirements:
        (1) Has graduated from a regionally accredited
    	
college or university with a bachelor's degree or higher.
        (2) (Blank).

seeking a middle or secondary level endorsement or, if seeking an early childhood, elementary, or special education endorsement, has completed a major in the content area of reading, English/language arts, mathematics, or one of the sciences. If the individual does not have a major in a content area for any level of teaching, he or she must submit transcripts to the State Board of Education to be reviewed for equivalency.
        (4) Has successfully completed phase (1) of
    	
subsection (b) of this Section.
        (5) Has passed a content area test required for the
    	
specific endorsement for admission into the program, as required under Section 21B-30 of this Code.
    A candidate possessing the alternative provisional educator endorsement may receive a salary, benefits, and any other terms of employment offered to teachers in the school who are members of an exclusive bargaining representative, if any, but a school is not required to provide these benefits during the years of residency if the candidate is serving only as a co-teacher. If the candidate is serving as the teacher of record, the candidate must receive a salary, benefits, and any other terms of employment. Residency experiences must not be counted towards tenure.
    (d) The recognized institution offering the Alternative Educator Licensure Program for Teachers must partner with a school district, including without limitation a preschool educational program under Section 2-3.71 of this Code or charter school, or a State-recognized, nonpublic school in this State in which the chief administrator is required to have the licensure necessary to be a principal in a public school in this State and in which a majority of the teachers are required to have the licensure necessary to be instructors in a public school in this State. A recognized institution that partners with a public school district administering a preschool educational program under Section 2-3.71 of this Code must require a principal to recommend or evaluate candidates in the program. A recognized institution that partners with an eligible entity administering a preschool educational program under Section 2-3.71 of this Code and that is not a public school district must require a principal or qualified equivalent of a principal to recommend or evaluate candidates in the program. The program presented for approval by the State Board of Education must demonstrate the supports that are to be provided to assist the provisional teacher during the 2-year residency period. These supports must provide additional contact hours with mentors during the first year of residency.
    (e) Upon completion of the 4 phases outlined in subsection (b) of this Section and all assessments required under Section 21B-30 of this Code, an individual shall receive a Professional Educator License.
    (f) The State Board of Education, in consultation with the State Educator Preparation and Licensure Board, may adopt such rules as may be necessary to establish and implement the Alternative Educator Licensure Program for Teachers.

    Sec. 21B-75. Suspension or revocation of license.
    (a) As used in this Section, "teacher" means any school district employee regularly required to be licensed, as provided in this Article, in order to teach or supervise in the public schools.
    (b) The State Superintendent of Education has the exclusive authority, in accordance with this Section and any rules adopted by the State Board of Education, in consultation with the State Educator Preparation and Licensure Board, to initiate the suspension of up to 5 calendar years or revocation of any license issued pursuant to this Article for abuse or neglect of a child, immorality, a condition of health detrimental to the welfare of pupils, incompetency, unprofessional conduct (which includes the failure to disclose on an employment application any previous conviction for a sex offense, as defined in Section 21B-80 of this Code, or any other offense committed in any other state or against the laws of the United States that, if committed in this State, would be punishable as a sex offense, as defined in Section 21B-80 of this Code), the neglect of any professional duty, willful or negligent failure to report an instance of suspected child abuse or neglect as required by the Abused and Neglected Child Reporting Act, or other just cause. Negligent failure to report an instance of suspected child abuse or neglect occurs when a teacher personally observes an instance of suspected child abuse or neglect and reasonably believes, in his or her professional or official capacity, that the instance constitutes an act of child abuse or neglect under the Abused and Neglected Child Reporting Act, and he or she, without willful intent, fails to immediately report or cause a report to be made of the suspected abuse or neglect to the Department of Children and Family Services, as required by the Abused and Neglected Child Reporting Act. Unprofessional conduct shall include the refusal to attend or participate in institutes, teachers' meetings, or professional readings or to meet other reasonable requirements of the regional superintendent of schools or State Superintendent of Education. Unprofessional conduct also includes conduct that violates the standards, ethics, or rules applicable to the security, administration, monitoring, or scoring of or the reporting of scores from any assessment test or examination administered under Section 2-3.64a-5 of this Code or that is known or intended to produce or report manipulated or artificial, rather than actual, assessment or achievement results or gains from the administration of those tests or examinations. Unprofessional conduct shall also include neglect or unnecessary delay in the making of statistical and other reports required by school officers. Incompetency shall include, without limitation, 2 or more school terms of service for which the license holder has received an unsatisfactory rating on a performance evaluation conducted pursuant to Article 24A of this Code within a period of 7 school terms of service. In determining whether to initiate action against one or more licenses based on incompetency and the recommended sanction for such action, the State Superintendent shall consider factors that include without limitation all of the following:
        (1) Whether the unsatisfactory evaluation ratings
    	
occurred prior to June 13, 2011 (the effective date of Public Act 97-8).
        (2) Whether the unsatisfactory evaluation ratings
    	
occurred prior to or after the implementation date, as defined in Section 24A-2.5 of this Code, of an evaluation system for teachers in a school district.
        (3) Whether the evaluator or evaluators who performed
    	
an unsatisfactory evaluation met the pre-licensure and training requirements set forth in Section 24A-3 of this Code.
        (4) The time between the unsatisfactory evaluation
    	
ratings.
        (5) The quality of the remediation plans associated
    	
with the unsatisfactory evaluation ratings and whether the license holder successfully completed the remediation plans.
        (6) Whether the unsatisfactory evaluation ratings
    	
were related to the same or different assignments performed by the license holder.
        (7) Whether one or more of the unsatisfactory
    	
evaluation ratings occurred in the first year of a teaching or administrative assignment.
When initiating an action against one or more licenses, the State Superintendent may seek required professional development as a sanction in lieu of or in addition to suspension or revocation. Any such required professional development must be at the expense of the license holder, who may use, if available and applicable to the requirements established by administrative or court order, training, coursework, or other professional development funds in accordance with the terms of an applicable collective bargaining agreement entered into after June 13, 2011 (the effective date of Public Act 97-8), unless that agreement specifically precludes use of funds for such purpose.
    (c) The State Superintendent of Education shall, upon receipt of evidence of abuse or neglect of a child, immorality, a condition of health detrimental to the welfare of pupils, incompetency (subject to subsection (b) of this Section), unprofessional conduct, the neglect of any professional duty, or other just cause, further investigate and, if and as appropriate, serve written notice to the individual and afford the individual opportunity for a hearing prior to suspension, revocation, or other sanction; provided that the State Superintendent is under no obligation to initiate such an investigation if the Department of Children and Family Services is investigating the same or substantially similar allegations and its child protective service unit has not made its determination, as required under Section 7.12 of the Abused and Neglected Child Reporting Act. If the State Superintendent of Education does not receive from an individual a request for a hearing within 10 days after the individual receives notice, the suspension, revocation, or other sanction shall immediately take effect in accordance with the notice. If a hearing is requested within 10 days after notice of an opportunity for hearing, it shall act as a stay of proceedings until the State Educator Preparation and Licensure Board issues a decision. Any hearing shall take place in the educational service region where the educator is or was last employed and in accordance with rules adopted by the State Board of Education, in consultation with the State Educator Preparation and Licensure Board, and such rules shall include without limitation provisions for discovery and the sharing of information between parties prior to the hearing. The standard of proof for any administrative hearing held pursuant to this Section shall be by the preponderance of the evidence. The decision of the State Educator Preparation and Licensure Board is a final administrative decision and is subject to judicial review by appeal of either party.
    The State Board of Education may refuse to issue or may suspend the license of any person who fails to file a return or to pay the tax, penalty, or interest shown in a filed return or to pay any final assessment of tax, penalty, or interest, as required by any tax Act administered by the Department of Revenue, until such time as the requirements of any such tax Act are satisfied.
    The exclusive authority of the State Superintendent of Education to initiate suspension or revocation of a license pursuant to this Section does not preclude a regional superintendent of schools from cooperating with the State Superintendent or a State's Attorney with respect to an investigation of alleged misconduct.
    (d) The State Superintendent of Education or his or her designee may initiate and conduct such investigations as may be reasonably necessary to establish the existence of any alleged misconduct. At any stage of the investigation, the State Superintendent may issue a subpoena requiring the attendance and testimony of a witness, including the license holder, and the production of any evidence, including files, records, correspondence, or documents, relating to any matter in question in the investigation. The subpoena shall require a witness to appear at the State Board of Education at a specified date and time and shall specify any evidence to be produced. The license holder is not entitled to be present, but the State Superintendent shall provide the license holder with a copy of any recorded testimony prior to a hearing under this Section. Such recorded testimony must not be used as evidence at a hearing, unless the license holder has adequate notice of the testimony and the opportunity to cross-examine the witness. Failure of a license holder to comply with a duly issued, investigatory subpoena may be grounds for revocation, suspension, or denial of a license.
    (e) All correspondence, documentation, and other information so received by the regional superintendent of schools, the State Superintendent of Education, the State Board of Education, or the State Educator Preparation and Licensure Board under this Section is confidential and must not be disclosed to third parties, except (i) as necessary for the State Superintendent of Education or his or her designee to investigate and prosecute pursuant to this Article, (ii) pursuant to a court order, (iii) for disclosure to the license holder or his or her representative, or (iv) as otherwise required in this Article and provided that any such information admitted into evidence in a hearing is exempt from this confidentiality and non-disclosure requirement.
    (f) The State Superintendent of Education or a person designated by him or her shall have the power to administer oaths to witnesses at any hearing conducted before the State Educator Preparation and Licensure Board pursuant to this Section. The State Superintendent of Education or a person designated by him or her is authorized to subpoena and bring before the State Educator Preparation and Licensure Board any person in this State and to take testimony either orally or by deposition or by exhibit, with the same fees and mileage and in the same manner as prescribed by law in judicial proceedings in civil cases in circuit courts of this State.
    (g) Any circuit court, upon the application of the State Superintendent of Education or the license holder, may, by order duly entered, require the attendance of witnesses and the production of relevant books and papers as part of any investigation or at any hearing the State Educator Preparation and Licensure Board is authorized to conduct pursuant to this Section, and the court may compel obedience to its orders by proceedings for contempt.
    (h) The State Board of Education shall receive an annual line item appropriation to cover fees associated with the investigation and prosecution of alleged educator misconduct and hearings related thereto.

    Non-public schools maintaining grades 9 through 12 shall provide catastrophic accident insurance coverage, with aggregate benefit limits of $3 million or 5 years, whichever occurs first, for eligible students in grades 9 through 12 who sustain an accidental injury while participating in school-sponsored or school-supervised interscholastic athletic tournaments sanctioned by the IHSA (including direct and uninterrupted travel to and from the athletic tournament as well as during a temporary stay at the location of an athletic tournament held away from the student's school) that results in medical expenses in excess of $50,000. These benefit limits are to be in excess of any and all other insurance, coverage or benefit, in whatever form or designation. Any non-public school that requires students participating in school-sponsored or school-supervised interscholastic athletic events sanctioned by the IHSA (including direct and uninterrupted travel to and from the athletic event as well as during a temporary stay at the location of an athletic event held away from the student's school) to be covered under an individual or group policy of accident and health insurance is exempt from the requirements of this Section.
    (c) The IHSA has the exclusive authority to promulgate a plan of coverage necessary to ensure compliance with this Section. The IHSA shall provide a group policy providing the coverage necessary to comply with this Section. Public school districts and non-public schools may purchase the coverage necessary to comply with this Section by participating in the group policy.
    Alternatively, public school districts or non-public schools that do not participate in the group policy may obtain the coverage necessary to comply with this Section from other coverage providers, but must submit to the IHSA, 60 days before the coverage inception, a certificate of insurance from the coverage provider stating that the insurance provided by the coverage provider is in compliance with the plan of coverage approved by the IHSA. A public school district that manages schools located within a city of over 500,000 inhabitants may provide the catastrophic accident insurance coverage required by this Section through a program of self-insurance, and the public school district must submit to the IHSA, 60 days before coverage inception, proof that the program is in compliance with the plan of coverage.
    (d) A public school district maintaining grades kindergarten through 8 may provide medical or hospital service, or both, through accident and health insurance on a group or individual basis, or through non-profit hospital service corporations or medical service plan corporations or both, for pupils of the district in grades kindergarten through 8 injured while participating in any athletic activity under the jurisdiction of or sponsored or controlled by the district or the authorities of any school thereof. The cost of such insurance or of subscriptions to such non-profit corporations, when paid from the funds of the district, shall, to the extent such moneys are sufficient, be paid from moneys derived from athletic activities. To the extent that moneys derived from athletic activities are insufficient, such cost may be paid from the educational fund of the district. Such insurance may be purchased from or such subscriptions may be taken in only such companies or corporations as are authorized to do business in Illinois.

    (105 ILCS 5/22-60)
    Sec. 22-60. Unfunded mandates prohibited.
    (a) No public school district or private school is obligated to comply with the following types of mandates unless a separate appropriation has been enacted into law providing full funding for the mandate for the school year during which the mandate is required:
        (1) Any mandate in this Code enacted after the
    	
effective date of this amendatory Act of the 96th General Assembly.
        (2) Any regulatory mandate promulgated by the State
    	
Board of Education and adopted by rule after the effective date of this amendatory Act of the 96th General Assembly other than those promulgated with respect to this Section or statutes already enacted on or before the effective date of this amendatory Act of the 96th General Assembly.
    (b) If the amount appropriated to fund a mandate described in subsection (a) of this Section does not fully fund the mandated activity, then the school district or private school may choose to discontinue or modify the mandated activity to ensure that the costs of compliance do not exceed the funding received.
    Before discontinuing or modifying the mandate, the school district shall petition its regional superintendent of schools on or before February 15 of each year to request to be exempt from implementing the mandate in a school or schools in the next school year. The petition shall include all legitimate costs associated with implementing and operating the mandate, the estimated reimbursement from State and federal sources, and any unique circumstances the school district can verify that exist that would cause the implementation and operation of such a mandate to be cost prohibitive.
    The regional superintendent of schools shall review the petition. In accordance with the Open Meetings Act, he or she shall convene a public hearing to hear testimony from the school district and interested community members. The regional superintendent shall, on or before March 15 of each year, inform the school district of his or her decision, along with the reasons why the exemption was granted or denied, in writing. The regional superintendent must also send notification to the State Board of Education detailing which school districts requested an exemption and the results.
    If the regional superintendent grants an exemption to the school district, then the school district is relieved from the requirement to establish and implement the mandate in the school or schools granted an exemption for the next school year. If the regional superintendent of schools does not grant an exemption, then the school district shall implement the mandate in accordance with the applicable law or rule by the first student attendance day of the next school year. However, the school district or a resident of the school district may on or before April 15 appeal the decision of the regional superintendent to the State Superintendent of Education. The State Superintendent shall hear appeals on the decisions of regional superintendents of schools no later than May 15 of each year. The State Superintendent shall make a final decision at the conclusion of the hearing on the school district's request for an exemption from the mandate. If the State Superintendent grants an exemption, then the school district is relieved from the requirement to implement a mandate in the school or schools granted an exemption for the next school year. If the State Superintendent does not grant an exemption, then the school district shall implement the mandate in accordance with the applicable law or rule by the first student attendance day of the next school year.
    If a school district or private school discontinues or modifies a mandated activity due to lack of full funding from the State, then the school district or private school shall annually maintain and update a list of discontinued or modified mandated activities. The list shall be provided to the State Board of Education upon request.
    (c) This Section does not apply to (i) any new statutory or regulatory mandates related to revised learning standards developed through the Common Core State Standards Initiative and assessments developed to align with those standards or actions specified in this State's Phase 2 Race to the Top Grant application if the application is approved by the United States Department of Education or (ii) new statutory or regulatory mandates from the Race to the Top Grant through the federal American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 imposed on school districts designated as being in the lowest performing 5% of schools within the Race to the Top Grant application.
    (d) In any instances in which this Section conflicts with the State Mandates Act, the State Mandates Act shall prevail.

    (105 ILCS 5/22-80)
    Sec. 22-80. Student athletes; concussions and head injuries.
    (a) The General Assembly recognizes all of the following:
        (1) Concussions are one of the most commonly reported
    	
injuries in children and adolescents who participate in sports and recreational activities. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that as many as 3,900,000 sports-related and recreation-related concussions occur in the United States each year. A concussion is caused by a blow or motion to the head or body that causes the brain to move rapidly inside the skull. The risk of catastrophic injuries or death is significant when a concussion or head injury is not properly evaluated and managed.
        (2) Concussions are a type of brain injury that can
    	
range from mild to severe and can disrupt the way the brain normally works. Concussions can occur in any organized or unorganized sport or recreational activity and can result from a fall or from players colliding with each other, the ground, or with obstacles. Concussions occur with or without loss of consciousness, but the vast majority of concussions occur without loss of consciousness.
        (3) Continuing to play with a concussion or symptoms
    	
of a head injury leaves a young athlete especially vulnerable to greater injury and even death. The General Assembly recognizes that, despite having generally recognized return-to-play standards for concussions and head injuries, some affected youth athletes are prematurely returned to play, resulting in actual or potential physical injury or death to youth athletes in this State.
        (4) Student athletes who have sustained a concussion
    	
may need informal or formal accommodations, modifications of curriculum, and monitoring by medical or academic staff until the student is fully recovered. To that end, all schools are encouraged to establish a return-to-learn protocol that is based on peer-reviewed scientific evidence consistent with Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines and conduct baseline testing for student athletes.
    (b) In this Section:
    "Athletic trainer" means an athletic trainer licensed under the Illinois Athletic Trainers Practice Act who is working under the supervision of a physician.
    "Coach" means any volunteer or employee of a school who is responsible for organizing and supervising students to teach them or train them in the fundamental skills of an interscholastic athletic activity. "Coach" refers to both head coaches and assistant coaches.
    "Concussion" means a complex pathophysiological process affecting the brain caused by a traumatic physical force or impact to the head or body, which may include temporary or prolonged altered brain function resulting in physical, cognitive, or emotional symptoms or altered sleep patterns and which may or may not involve a loss of consciousness.
    "Department" means the Department of Financial and Professional Regulation.
    "Game official" means a person who officiates at an interscholastic athletic activity, such as a referee or umpire, including, but not limited to, persons enrolled as game officials by the Illinois High School Association or Illinois Elementary School Association.
    "Interscholastic athletic activity" means any organized school-sponsored or school-sanctioned activity for students, generally outside of school instructional hours, under the direction of a coach, athletic director, or band leader, including, but not limited to, baseball, basketball, cheerleading, cross country track, fencing, field hockey, football, golf, gymnastics, ice hockey, lacrosse, marching band, rugby, soccer, skating, softball, swimming and diving, tennis, track (indoor and outdoor), ultimate Frisbee, volleyball, water polo, and wrestling. All interscholastic athletics are deemed to be interscholastic activities.
    "Licensed healthcare professional" means a person who has experience with concussion management and who is a nurse, a psychologist who holds a license under the Clinical Psychologist Licensing Act and specializes in the practice of neuropsychology, a physical therapist licensed under the Illinois Physical Therapy Act, an occupational therapist licensed under the Illinois Occupational Therapy Practice Act, a physician assistant, or an athletic trainer.
    "Nurse" means a person who is employed by or volunteers at a school and is licensed under the Nurse Practice Act as a registered nurse, practical nurse, or advanced practice registered nurse.
    "Physician" means a physician licensed to practice medicine in all of its branches under the Medical Practice Act of 1987.
    "Physician assistant" means a physician assistant licensed under the Physician Assistant Practice Act of 1987.
    "School" means any public or private elementary or secondary school, including a charter school.
    "Student" means an adolescent or child enrolled in a school.
    (c) This Section applies to any interscholastic athletic activity, including practice and competition, sponsored or sanctioned by a school, the Illinois Elementary School Association, or the Illinois High School Association. This Section applies beginning with the 2016-2017 school year.
    (d) The governing body of each public or charter school and the appropriate administrative officer of a private school with students enrolled who participate in an interscholastic athletic activity shall appoint or approve a concussion oversight team. Each concussion oversight team shall establish a return-to-play protocol, based on peer-reviewed scientific evidence consistent with Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines, for a student's return to interscholastic athletics practice or competition following a force or impact believed to have caused a concussion. Each concussion oversight team shall also establish a return-to-learn protocol, based on peer-reviewed scientific evidence consistent with Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines, for a student's return to the classroom after that student is believed to have experienced a concussion, whether or not the concussion took place while the student was participating in an interscholastic athletic activity.
    Each concussion oversight team must include to the extent practicable at least one physician. If a school employs an athletic trainer, the athletic trainer must be a member of the school concussion oversight team to the extent practicable. If a school employs a nurse, the nurse must be a member of the school concussion oversight team to the extent practicable. At a minimum, a school shall appoint a person who is responsible for implementing and complying with the return-to-play and return-to-learn protocols adopted by the concussion oversight team. At a minimum, a concussion oversight team may be composed of only one person and this person need not be a licensed healthcare professional, but it may not be a coach. A school may appoint other licensed healthcare professionals to serve on the concussion oversight team.
    (e) A student may not participate in an interscholastic athletic activity for a school year until the student and the student's parent or guardian or another person with legal authority to make medical decisions for the student have signed a form for that school year that acknowledges receiving and reading written information that explains concussion prevention, symptoms, treatment, and oversight and that includes guidelines for safely resuming participation in an athletic activity following a concussion. The form must be approved by the Illinois High School Association.
    (f) A student must be removed from an interscholastic athletics practice or competition immediately if one of the following persons believes the student might have sustained a concussion during the practice or competition:
        (1) a coach;
        (2) a physician;
        (3) a game official;
        (4) an athletic trainer;
        (5) the student's parent or guardian or another
    	
person with legal authority to make medical decisions for the student;
        (6) the student; or
        (7) any other person deemed appropriate under the
    	
school's return-to-play protocol.
    (g) A student removed from an interscholastic athletics practice or competition under this Section may not be permitted to practice or compete again following the force or impact believed to have caused the concussion until:
        (1) the student has been evaluated, using established
    	
medical protocols based on peer-reviewed scientific evidence consistent with Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines, by a treating physician (chosen by the student or the student's parent or guardian or another person with legal authority to make medical decisions for the student), an athletic trainer, an advanced practice registered nurse, or a physician assistant;
        (2) the student has successfully completed each
    	
requirement of the return-to-play protocol established under this Section necessary for the student to return to play;
        (3) the student has successfully completed each
    	
requirement of the return-to-learn protocol established under this Section necessary for the student to return to learn;
        (4) the treating physician, the athletic trainer, or
    	
the physician assistant has provided a written statement indicating that, in the physician's professional judgment, it is safe for the student to return to play and return to learn or the treating advanced practice registered nurse has provided a written statement indicating that it is safe for the student to return to play and return to learn; and
        (5) the student and the student's parent or guardian
    	
or another person with legal authority to make medical decisions for the student:
            (A) have acknowledged that the student has
        	
completed the requirements of the return-to-play and return-to-learn protocols necessary for the student to return to play;
            (B) have provided the treating physician's,
        	
athletic trainer's, advanced practice registered nurse's, or physician assistant's written statement under subdivision (4) of this subsection (g) to the person responsible for compliance with the return-to-play and return-to-learn protocols under this subsection (g) and the person who has supervisory responsibilities under this subsection (g); and
            (C) have signed a consent form indicating that
        	
the person signing:
                (i) has been informed concerning and consents
            	
to the student participating in returning to play in accordance with the return-to-play and return-to-learn protocols;
                (ii) understands the risks associated with
            	
the student returning to play and returning to learn and will comply with any ongoing requirements in the return-to-play and return-to-learn protocols; and
                (iii) consents to the disclosure to
            	
appropriate persons, consistent with the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (Public Law 104-191), of the treating physician's, athletic trainer's, physician assistant's, or advanced practice registered nurse's written statement under subdivision (4) of this subsection (g) and, if any, the return-to-play and return-to-learn recommendations of the treating physician, the athletic trainer, the physician assistant, or the advanced practice registered nurse, as the case may be.
    A coach of an interscholastic athletics team may not authorize a student's return to play or return to learn.
    The district superintendent or the superintendent's designee in the case of a public elementary or secondary school, the chief school administrator or that person's designee in the case of a charter school, or the appropriate administrative officer or that person's designee in the case of a private school shall supervise an athletic trainer or other person responsible for compliance with the return-to-play protocol and shall supervise the person responsible for compliance with the return-to-learn protocol. The person who has supervisory responsibilities under this paragraph may not be a coach of an interscholastic athletics team.
    (h)(1) The Illinois High School Association shall approve, for coaches, game officials, and non-licensed healthcare professionals, training courses that provide for not less than 2 hours of training in the subject matter of concussions, including evaluation, prevention, symptoms, risks, and long-term effects. The Association shall maintain an updated list of individuals and organizations authorized by the Association to provide the training.

    Sec. 22-85. Graduation requirements; Free Application for Federal Student Aid.
    (a) Beginning with the 2020-2021 school year, in addition to any other requirements under this Code, as a prerequisite to receiving a high school diploma from a public high school, the parent or guardian of each student or, if a student is at least 18 years of age or legally emancipated, the student must comply with either of the following:
        (1) File a Free Application for Federal Student Aid
    	
with the United States Department of Education or, if applicable, an application for State financial aid.
        (2) On a form created by the State Board of
    	
Education, file a waiver with the student's school district indicating that the parent or guardian or, if applicable, the student understands what the Free Application for Federal Student Aid and application for State financial aid are and has chosen not to file an application under paragraph (1).
    (b) Each school district with a high school must require each high school student to comply with this Section and must provide to each high school student and, if applicable, his or her parent or guardian any support or assistance necessary to comply with this Section.

    (c) The State Board of Education may adopt rules to implement this Section.

    (Text of Section from P.A. 101-478)
    Sec. 22-85. Parental notification of law enforcement detainment and questioning on school grounds.
    (a) In this Section, "school grounds" means the real property comprising an active and operational elementary or secondary school during the regular hours in which school is in session and when students are present.
    (b) Before detaining and questioning a student on school grounds who is under 18 years of age and who is suspected of committing a criminal act, a law enforcement officer, school resource officer, or other school security personnel must do all of the following:
        (1) Ensure that notification or attempted
    	
notification of the student's parent or guardian is made.
        (2) Document the time and manner in which the
    	
notification or attempted notification under paragraph (1) occurred.
        (3) Make reasonable efforts to ensure that the
    	
student's parent or guardian is present during the questioning or, if the parent or guardian is not present, ensure that school personnel, including, but not limited to, a school social worker, a school psychologist, a school nurse, a school guidance counselor, or any other mental health professional, are present during the questioning.
        (4) If practicable, make reasonable efforts to ensure
    	
that a law enforcement officer trained in promoting safe interactions and communications with youth is present during the questioning. An officer who received training in youth investigations approved or certified by his or her law enforcement agency or under Section 10.22 of the Police Training Act or a juvenile police officer, as defined under Section 1-3 of the Juvenile Court Act of 1987, satisfies the requirement under this paragraph.
    (c) This Section does not limit the authority of a law enforcement officer to make an arrest on school grounds. This Section does not apply to circumstances that would cause a reasonable person to believe that urgent and immediate action is necessary to do any of the following:
        (1) Prevent bodily harm or injury to the student or
    	
any other person.
        (2) Apprehend an armed or fleeing suspect.
        (3) Prevent the destruction of evidence.
        (4) Address an emergency or other dangerous
    	
situation.

    (Text of Section from P.A. 101-531)
    Sec. 22-85. Sexual abuse at schools.
    (a) The General Assembly finds that:
        (1) investigation of a child regarding an incident of
    	
sexual abuse can induce significant trauma for the child;
        (2) it is desirable to prevent multiple interviews of
    	
a child at a school; and
        (3) it is important to recognize the role of
    	
Children's Advocacy Centers in conducting developmentally appropriate investigations.
    (b) In this Section:
    "Alleged incident of sexual abuse" is limited to an incident of sexual abuse of a child that is alleged to have been perpetrated by school personnel, including a school vendor or volunteer, that occurred (i) on school grounds or during a school activity or (ii) outside of school grounds or not during a school activity.
    "Appropriate law enforcement agency" means a law enforcement agency whose employees have been involved, in some capacity, with an investigation of a particular alleged incident of sexual abuse.
    (c) If a mandated reporter within a school has knowledge of an alleged incident of sexual abuse, the reporter must call the Department of Children and Family Services' hotline established under Section 7.6 of the Abused and Neglected Child Reporting Act immediately after obtaining the minimal information necessary to make a report, including the names of the affected parties and the allegations. The State Board of Education must make available materials detailing the information that is necessary to enable notification to the Department of Children and Family Services of an alleged incident of sexual abuse. Each school must ensure that mandated reporters review the State Board of Education's materials and materials developed by the Department of Children and Family Services and distributed in the school building under Section 7 of the Abused and Neglected Child Reporting Act at least once annually.
    (d) For schools in a county with an accredited Children's Advocacy Center, every alleged incident of sexual abuse that is reported to the Department of Children and Family Services' hotline or a law enforcement agency and is subsequently accepted for investigation must be referred by the entity that received the report to the local Children's Advocacy Center pursuant to that county's multidisciplinary team's protocol under the Children's Advocacy Center Act for investigating child sexual abuse allegations.
    (e) A county's local Children's Advocacy Center must, at a minimum, do both of the following regarding a referred case of an alleged incident of sexual abuse:
        (1) Coordinate the investigation of the alleged
    	
incident, as governed by the local Children's Advocacy Center's existing multidisciplinary team protocol and according to National Children's Alliance accreditation standards.
        (2) Facilitate communication between the
    	
multidisciplinary team investigating the alleged incident of sexual abuse and, if applicable, the referring school's (i) Title IX officer, or his or her designee, (ii) school resource officer, or (iii) personnel leading the school's investigation into the alleged incident of sexual abuse. If a school uses a designated entity to investigate a sexual abuse allegation, the multidisciplinary team may correspond only with that entity and any reference in this Section to "school" refers to that designated entity. This facilitation of communication must, at a minimum, ensure that all applicable parties have each other's contact information and must share the county's local Children's Advocacy Center's protocol regarding the process of approving the viewing of a forensic interview, as defined under Section 2.5 of the Children's Advocacy Center Act, by school personnel and a contact person for questions relating to the protocol.
    (f) After an alleged incident of sexual abuse is accepted for investigation by the Department of Children and Family Services or a law enforcement agency and while the criminal and child abuse investigations related to that alleged incident are being conducted by the local multidisciplinary team, the school relevant to the alleged incident of sexual abuse must comply with both of the following:
        (1) It may not interview the alleged victim regarding
    	
details of the alleged incident of sexual abuse until after the completion of the forensic interview of that victim is conducted at a Children's Advocacy Center. This paragraph does not prohibit a school from requesting information from the alleged victim or his or her parent or guardian to ensure the safety and well-being of the alleged victim at school during an investigation.
        (2) If asked by a law enforcement agency or an
    	
investigator of the Department of Children and Family Services who is conducting the investigation, it must inform those individuals of any evidence the school has gathered pertaining to an alleged incident of sexual abuse, as permissible by federal or State law.
    (g) After completion of a forensic interview, the multidisciplinary team must notify the school relevant to the alleged incident of sexual abuse of its completion. If, for any reason, a multidisciplinary team determines it will not conduct a forensic interview in a specific investigation, the multidisciplinary team must notify the school as soon as the determination is made. If a forensic interview has not been conducted within 15 calendar days after opening an investigation, the school may notify the multidisciplinary team that it intends to interview the alleged victim. No later than 10 calendar days after this notification, the multidisciplinary team may conduct the forensic interview and, if the multidisciplinary team does not conduct the interview, the school may proceed with its interview.
    (h) To the greatest extent possible considering student safety and Title IX compliance, school personnel may view the electronic recordings of a forensic interview of an alleged victim of an incident of sexual abuse. As a means to avoid additional interviews of an alleged victim, school personnel must be granted viewing access to the electronic recording of a forensic interview conducted at an accredited Children's Advocacy Center for an alleged incident of sexual abuse only if the school receives (i) approval from the multidisciplinary team investigating the case and (ii) informed consent by a child over the age of 13 or the child's parent or guardian. Each county's local Children's Advocacy Center and multidisciplinary team must establish an internal protocol regarding the process of approving the viewing of the forensic interview, and this process and the contact person must be shared with the school contact at the time of the initial facilitation. Whenever possible, the school's viewing of the electronic recording of a forensic interview should be conducted in lieu of the need for additional interviews.
    (i) For an alleged incident of sexual abuse that has been accepted for investigation by a multidisciplinary team, if, during the course of its internal investigation and at any point during or after the multidisciplinary team's investigation, the school determines that it needs to interview the alleged victim to successfully complete its investigation and the victim is under 18 years of age, a child advocate must be made available to the student and may be present during the school's interview. A child advocate may be a school social worker, a school or equally qualified psychologist, or a person in a position the State Board of Education has identified as an appropriate advocate for the student during a school's investigation into an alleged incident of sexual abuse.
    (j) The Department of Children and Family Services must notify the relevant school when an agency investigation of an alleged incident of sexual abuse is complete. The notification must include information on the outcome of that investigation.
    (k) The appropriate law enforcement agency must notify the relevant school when an agency investigation of an alleged incident of sexual abuse is complete or has been suspended. The notification must include information on the outcome of that investigation.
    (l) This Section applies to all schools operating under this Code, including, but not limited to, public schools located in cities having a population of more than 500,000, a school operated pursuant to an agreement with a public school district, alternative schools operated by third parties, an alternative learning opportunities program, a public school administered by a local public agency or the Department of Human Services, charter schools operating under the authority of Article 27A, and non-public schools recognized by the State Board of Education.

    (Section scheduled to be repealed on February 1, 2023)
    Sec. 22-90. Whole Child Task Force.
    (a) The General Assembly makes all of the following findings:
        (1) The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed systemic
    	
inequities in American society. Students, educators, and families throughout this State have been deeply affected by the pandemic, and the impact of the pandemic will be felt for years to come. The negative consequences of the pandemic have impacted students and communities differently along the lines of race, income, language, and special needs. However, students in this State faced significant unmet physical health, mental health, and social and emotional needs even prior to the pandemic.
        (2) The path to recovery requires a commitment from
    	
adults in this State to address our students cultural, physical, emotional, and mental health needs and to provide them with stronger and increased systemic support and intervention.
        (3) It is well documented that trauma and toxic
    	
stress diminish a child's ability to thrive. Forms of childhood trauma and toxic stress include adverse childhood experiences, systemic racism, poverty, food and housing insecurity, and gender-based violence. The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated these issues and brought them into focus.
        (4) It is estimated that, overall, approximately 40%
    	
of children in this State have experienced at least one adverse childhood experience and approximately 10% have experienced 3 or more adverse childhood experiences. However, the number of adverse childhood experiences is higher for Black and Hispanic children who are growing up in poverty. The COVID-19 pandemic has amplified the number of students who have experienced childhood trauma. Also, the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted preexisting inequities in school disciplinary practices that disproportionately impact Black and Brown students. Research shows, for example, that girls of color are disproportionately impacted by trauma, adversity, and abuse, and instead of receiving the care and trauma-informed support they may need, many Black girls in particular face disproportionately harsh disciplinary measures.
        (5) The cumulative effects of trauma and toxic stress
    	
adversely impact the physical health of students, as well as their ability to learn, form relationships, and self-regulate. If left unaddressed, these effects increase a student's risk for depression, alcoholism, anxiety, asthma, smoking, and suicide, all of which are risks that disproportionately affect Black youth and may lead to a host of medical diseases as an adult. Access to infant and early childhood mental health services is critical to ensure the social and emotional well-being of this State's youngest children, particularly those children who have experienced trauma.
        (6) Although this State enacted measures through
    	
Public Act 100-105 to address the high rate of early care and preschool expulsions of infants, toddlers, and preschoolers and the disproportionately higher rate of expulsion for Black and Hispanic children, a recent study found a wide variation in the awareness, understanding, and compliance with the law by providers of early childhood care. Further work is needed to implement the law, which includes providing training to early childhood care providers to increase their understanding of the law, increasing the availability and access to infant and early childhood mental health services, and building aligned data collection systems to better understand expulsion rates and to allow for accurate reporting as required by the law.
        (7) Many educators and schools in this State have
    	
embraced and implemented evidenced-based restorative justice and trauma-responsive and culturally relevant practices and interventions. However, the use of these interventions on students is often isolated or is implemented occasionally and only if the school has the appropriate leadership, resources, and partners available to engage seriously in this work. It would be malpractice to deny our students access to these practices and interventions, especially in the aftermath of a once-in-a-century pandemic.
    (b) The Whole Child Task Force is created for the purpose of establishing an equitable, inclusive, safe, and supportive environment in all schools for every student in this State. The task force shall have all of the following goals, which means key steps have to be taken to ensure that every child in every school in this State has access to teachers, social workers, school leaders, support personnel, and others who have been trained in evidenced-based interventions and restorative practices:
        (1) To create a common definition of a
    	
trauma-responsive school, a trauma-responsive district, and a trauma-responsive community.
        (2) To outline the training and resources required to
    	
create and sustain a system of support for trauma-responsive schools, districts, and communities and to identify this State's role in that work, including recommendations concerning options for redirecting resources from school resource officers to classroom-based support.
        (3) To identify or develop a process to conduct an
    	
analysis of the organizations that provide training in restorative practices, implicit bias, anti-racism, and trauma-responsive systems, mental health services, and social and emotional services to schools.
        (4) To provide recommendations concerning the key
    	
data to be collected and reported to ensure that this State has a full and accurate understanding of the progress toward ensuring that all schools, including programs and providers of care to pre-kindergarten children, employ restorative, anti-racist, and trauma-responsive strategies and practices. The data collected must include information relating to the availability of trauma responsive support structures in schools as well as disciplinary practices employed on students in person or through other means, including during remote or blended learning. It should also include information on the use of, and funding for, school resource officers and other similar police personnel in school programs.
        (5) To recommend an implementation timeline,
    	
including the key roles, responsibilities, and resources to advance this State toward a system in which every school, district, and community is progressing toward becoming trauma-responsive.
        (6) To seek input and feedback from stakeholders,
    	
including parents, students, and educators, who reflect the diversity of this State.
    (c) Members of the Whole Child Task Force shall be appointed by the State Superintendent of Education. Members of this task force must represent the diversity of this State and possess the expertise needed to perform the work required to meet the goals of the task force set forth under subsection (a). Members of the task force shall include all of the following:

        (20) One member of an organization whose mission is

    (105 ILCS 5/24-6)
    Sec. 24-6. Sick leave. The school boards of all school districts, including special charter districts, but not including school districts in municipalities of 500,000 or more, shall grant their full-time teachers, and also shall grant such of their other employees as are eligible to participate in the Illinois Municipal Retirement Fund under the "600-Hour Standard" established, or under such other eligibility participation standard as may from time to time be established, by rules and regulations now or hereafter promulgated by the Board of that Fund under Section 7-198 of the Illinois Pension Code, as now or hereafter amended, sick leave provisions not less in amount than 10 days at full pay in each school year. If any such teacher or employee does not use the full amount of annual leave thus allowed, the unused amount shall be allowed to accumulate to a minimum available leave of 180 days at full pay, including the leave of the current year. Sick leave shall be interpreted to mean personal illness, quarantine at home, serious illness or death in the immediate family or household, or birth, adoption, or placement for adoption. The school board may require a certificate from a physician licensed in Illinois to practice medicine and surgery in all its branches, a chiropractic physician licensed under the Medical Practice Act of 1987, a licensed advanced practice registered nurse, a licensed physician assistant, or, if the treatment is by prayer or spiritual means, a spiritual adviser or practitioner of the teacher's or employee's faith as a basis for pay during leave after an absence of 3 days for personal illness or 30 days for birth or as the school board may deem necessary in other cases. If the school board does require a certificate as a basis for pay during leave of less than 3 days for personal illness, the school board shall pay, from school funds, the expenses incurred by the teachers or other employees in obtaining the certificate. For paid leave for adoption or placement for adoption, the school board may require that the teacher or other employee provide evidence that the formal adoption process is underway, and such leave is limited to 30 days unless a longer leave has been negotiated with the exclusive bargaining representative.
    If, by reason of any change in the boundaries of school districts, or by reason of the creation of a new school district, the employment of a teacher is transferred to a new or different board, the accumulated sick leave of such teacher is not thereby lost, but is transferred to such new or different district.
    For purposes of this Section, "immediate family" shall include parents, spouse, brothers, sisters, children, grandparents, grandchildren, parents-in-law, brothers-in-law, sisters-in-law, and legal guardians.

    (105 ILCS 5/24-6.1) (from Ch. 122, par. 24-6.1)
    Sec. 24-6.1. Sabbatical leave. Every school board may grant a sabbatical leave of absence to a teacher, principal or superintendent performing contractual continued service, for a period of at least 4 school months but not in excess of one school term, for resident study, research, travel or other purposes designed to improve the school system. The grant of a sabbatical leave by a school board shall constitute a finding that the leave is deemed to benefit the school system by improving the quality and level of experience of the teaching force.
    This leave may be granted after completion of at least 6 years of satisfactory service as a full time teacher, principal or superintendent and may again be granted after completion of a subsequent period of 6 years of such service. However, 2 sabbatical leaves, each consisting of at least 4 months but totaling no more than the equivalent of one school year, may be granted within a 6 year period. A leave granted for a period of one school year or less shall bar a further sabbatical leave until completion of 6 years additional satisfactory service, except that 2 leaves which total no more than the equivalent of one school year shall bar a further sabbatical leave only until the completion of 6 years additional satisfactory service following the completion of the first such leave. The leave shall be conditional upon a plan for resident study, research, travel or other activities proposed by the applicant and deemed by the board to benefit the school system, which plan shall be approved by the board and not thereafter modified without the approval of the board.
    Before a leave is granted pursuant to this Section, the applicant shall agree in writing that if at the expiration of such leave he does not return to and perform contractual continued service in the district for at least one school year after his return, all sums of money received from the board during his sabbatical leave will be refunded to the board unless such return and performance is prevented by illness or incapacity.
    During absence pursuant to such leave, such teacher, principal or superintendent shall receive the same basic salary as if in actual service, except that there may be deducted therefrom an amount equivalent to the amount payable for substitute service. However, such salary after deduction for substitute service shall in no case be less than the minimum provided by Section 24-8 of this Act or 1/2 of the basic salary, whichever is greater. The person on leave shall not engage in any activity for which salary or compensation is paid unless the activity is directly related to the purpose for which the leave is granted and is approved by the board. A sabbatical leave may be granted to enable the applicant, if otherwise eligible, to accept scholarships for study or research. Unless justified by illness or incapacity, failure of any person granted a leave under this Section to devote the entire period to the purposes for which the leave was granted shall constitute a cause for removal from teaching service.
    Upon expiration of a leave granted pursuant to this Section, and upon presentation of evidence satisfactory to the board showing compliance with the conditions of the leave, the teacher, principal or superintendent shall be returned to a position equivalent to that formerly occupied. The contractual continued service status of the person on sabbatical leave shall not be affected.
    Absence during a leave granted pursuant to this Section shall not be construed as a discontinuance of service for any purpose, including progression on the salary schedule if one is in effect in the district. The board shall pay the contribution to the Teachers' Retirement System required of the person on leave computed on the annual full-time salary rate under which the member last received earnings immediately prior to the leave or a proportionate part of such rate for a partial year of sabbatical leave credit.
    This Section in no way limits the power of the board to grant leaves for other purposes.

    On or before January 31, 2020, the Professional Review Panel created under Section 18-8.15 must submit a report to the General Assembly on how State funds and funds distributed under the evidence-based funding formula under Section 18-8.15 may aid the financial effects of the changes made by this amendatory Act of the 101st General Assembly.
    Based upon previous public school experience in this State or any other state, territory, dependency or possession of the United States, or in schools operated by or under the auspices of the United States, teachers who serve on a full-time basis shall have their salaries increased to at least the following amounts above the starting salary for a teacher in such district in the same classification: with less than a bachelor's degree, $750 after 5 years; with 120 semester hours or more and a bachelor's degree, $1,000 after 5 years and $1,600 after 8 years; with 150 semester hours or more and a master's degree, $1,250 after 5 years, $2,000 after 8 years and $2,750 after 13 years.

the teacher receives overall annual evaluation ratings of at least "Proficient" in the last school term and at least "Proficient" in either the second or third school term;
        (2) 3 consecutive school terms of service in which
    	
the teacher receives 3 overall annual evaluations of "Excellent"; or
        (3) 2 consecutive school terms of service in which
    	
the teacher receives 2 overall annual evaluations of "Excellent" service, but only if the teacher (i) previously attained contractual continued service in a different school district or program in this State, (ii) voluntarily departed or was honorably dismissed from that school district or program in the school term immediately prior to the teacher's first school term of service applicable to the attainment of contractual continued service under this subdivision (3), and (iii) received, in his or her 2 most recent overall annual or biennial evaluations from the prior school district or program, ratings of at least "Proficient", with both such ratings occurring after the school district's or program's PERA implementation date. For a teacher to attain contractual continued service under this subdivision (3), the teacher shall provide official copies of his or her 2 most recent overall annual or biennial evaluations from the prior school district or program to the new school district or program within 60 days from the teacher's first day of service with the new school district or program. The prior school district or program must provide the teacher with official copies of his or her 2 most recent overall annual or biennial evaluations within 14 days after the teacher's request. If a teacher has requested such official copies prior to 45 days after the teacher's first day of service with the new school district or program and the teacher's prior school district or program fails to provide the teacher with the official copies required under this subdivision (3), then the time period for the teacher to submit the official copies to his or her new school district or program must be extended until 14 days after receipt of such copies from the prior school district or program. If the prior school district or program fails to provide the teacher with the official copies required under this subdivision (3) within 90 days from the teacher's first day of service with the new school district or program, then the new school district or program shall rely upon the teacher's own copies of his or her evaluations for purposes of this subdivision (3).
    If the teacher does not receive overall annual evaluations of "Excellent" in the school terms necessary for eligibility to achieve accelerated contractual continued service in subdivisions (2) and (3) of this subsection (d), the teacher shall be eligible for contractual continued service pursuant to subdivision (1) of this subsection (d). If, at the conclusion of 4 consecutive school terms of service that count toward attainment of contractual continued service, the teacher's performance does not qualify the teacher for contractual continued service under subdivision (1) of this subsection (d), then the teacher shall not enter upon contractual continued service and shall be dismissed. If a performance evaluation is not conducted for any school term when such evaluation is required to be conducted under Section 24A-5 of this Code, then the teacher's performance evaluation rating for such school term for purposes of determining the attainment of contractual continued service shall be deemed "Proficient", except that, during any time in which the Governor has declared a disaster due to a public health emergency pursuant to Section 7 of the Illinois Emergency Management Agency Act, this default to "Proficient" does not apply to any teacher who has entered into contractual continued service and who was deemed "Excellent" on his or her most recent evaluation. During any time in which the Governor has declared a disaster due to a public health emergency pursuant to Section 7 of the Illinois Emergency Management Agency Act and unless the school board and any exclusive bargaining representative have completed the performance rating for teachers or mutually agreed to an alternate performance rating, any teacher who has entered into contractual continued service, whose most recent evaluation was deemed "Excellent", and whose performance evaluation is not conducted when the evaluation is required to be conducted shall receive a teacher's performance rating deemed "Excellent". A school board and any exclusive bargaining representative may mutually agree to an alternate performance rating for teachers not in contractual continued service during any time in which the Governor has declared a disaster due to a public health emergency pursuant to Section 7 of the Illinois Emergency Management Agency Act, as long as the agreement is in writing.
    (e) For the purposes of determining contractual continued service, a school term shall be counted only toward attainment of contractual continued service if the teacher actually teaches or is otherwise present and participating in the district's or program's educational program for 120 days or more, provided that the days of leave under the federal Family Medical Leave Act that the teacher is required to take until the end of the school term shall be considered days of teaching or participation in the district's or program's educational program. A school term that is not counted toward attainment of contractual continued service shall not be considered a break in service for purposes of determining whether a teacher has been employed for 4 consecutive school terms, provided that the teacher actually teaches or is otherwise present and participating in the district's or program's educational program in the following school term.
    (f) If the employing board determines to dismiss the teacher in the last year of the probationary period as provided in subsection (c) of this Section or subdivision (1) or (2) of subsection (d) of this Section, but not subdivision (3) of subsection (d) of this Section, the written notice of dismissal provided by the employing board must contain specific reasons for dismissal. Any full-time teacher who does not receive written notice from the employing board at least 45 days before the end of any school term as provided in this Section and whose performance does not require dismissal after the fourth probationary year pursuant to subsection (d) of this Section shall be re-employed for the following school term.
    (g) Contractual continued service shall continue in effect the terms and provisions of the contract with the teacher during the last school term of the probationary period, subject to this Act and the lawful regulations of the employing board. This Section and succeeding Sections do not modify any existing power of the board except with respect to the procedure of the discharge of a teacher and reductions in salary as hereinafter provided. Contractual continued service status shall not restrict the power of the board to transfer a teacher to a position which the teacher is qualified to fill or to make such salary adjustments as it deems desirable, but unless reductions in salary are uniform or based upon some reasonable classification, any teacher whose salary is reduced shall be entitled to a notice and a hearing as hereinafter provided in the case of certain dismissals or removals.
    (h) If, by reason of any change in the boundaries of school districts or by reason of the creation of a new school district, the position held by any teacher having a contractual continued service status is transferred from one board to the control of a new or different board, then the contractual continued service status of the teacher is not thereby lost, and such new or different board is subject to this Code with respect to the teacher in the same manner as if the teacher were its employee and had been its employee during the time the teacher was actually employed by the board from whose control the position was transferred.
    (i) The employment of any teacher in a program of a special education joint agreement established under Section 3-15.14, 10-22.31 or 10-22.31a shall be governed by this and succeeding Sections of this Article. For purposes of attaining and maintaining contractual continued service and computing length of continuing service as referred to in this Section and Section 24-12, employment in a special educational joint program shall be deemed a continuation of all previous certificated employment of such teacher for such joint agreement whether the employer of the teacher was the joint agreement, the regional superintendent, or one of the participating districts in the joint agreement.
    (j) For any teacher employed after July 1, 1987 as a full-time teacher in a program of a special education joint agreement, whether the program is operated by the joint agreement or a member district on behalf of the joint agreement, in the event of a reduction in the number of programs or positions in the joint agreement in which the notice of dismissal is provided on or before the end of the 2010-2011 school term, the teacher in contractual continued service is eligible for employment in the joint agreement programs for which the teacher is legally qualified in order of greater length of continuing service in the joint agreement, unless an alternative method of determining the sequence of dismissal is established in a collective bargaining agreement. For any teacher employed after July 1, 1987 as a full-time teacher in a program of a special education joint agreement, whether the program is operated by the joint agreement or a member district on behalf of the joint agreement, in the event of a reduction in the number of programs or positions in the joint agreement in which the notice of dismissal is provided during the 2011-2012 school term or a subsequent school term, the teacher shall be included on the honorable dismissal lists of all joint agreement programs for positions for which the teacher is qualified and is eligible for employment in such programs in accordance with subsections (b) and (c) of Section 24-12 of this Code and the applicable honorable dismissal policies of the joint agreement.
    (k) For any teacher employed after July 1, 1987 as a full-time teacher in a program of a special education joint agreement, whether the program is operated by the joint agreement or a member district on behalf of the joint agreement, in the event of the dissolution of a joint agreement, in which the notice to teachers of the dissolution is provided during the 2010-2011 school term, the teacher in contractual continued service who is legally qualified shall be assigned to any comparable position in a member district currently held by a teacher who has not entered upon contractual continued service or held by a teacher who has entered upon contractual continued service with a shorter length of contractual continued service. Any teacher employed after July 1, 1987 as a full-time teacher in a program of a special education joint agreement, whether the program is operated by the joint agreement or a member district on behalf of the joint agreement, in the event of the dissolution of a joint agreement in which the notice to teachers of the dissolution is provided during the 2011-2012 school term or a subsequent school term, the teacher who is qualified shall be included on the order of honorable dismissal lists of each member district and shall be assigned to any comparable position in any such district in accordance with subsections (b) and (c) of Section 24-12 of this Code and the applicable honorable dismissal policies of each member district.
    (l) The governing board of the joint agreement, or the administrative district, if so authorized by the articles of agreement of the joint agreement, rather than the board of education of a school district, may carry out employment and termination actions including dismissals under this Section and Section 24-12.
    (m) The employment of any teacher in a special education program authorized by Section 14-1.01 through 14-14.01, or a joint educational program established under Section 10-22.31a, shall be under this and the succeeding Sections of this Article, and such employment shall be deemed a continuation of the previous employment of such teacher in any of the participating districts, regardless of the participation of other districts in the program.
    (n) Any teacher employed as a full-time teacher in a special education program prior to September 23, 1987 in which 2 or more school districts participate for a probationary period of 2 consecutive years shall enter upon contractual continued service in each of the participating districts, subject to this and the succeeding Sections of this Article, and, notwithstanding Section 24-1.5 of this Code, in the event of the termination of the program shall be eligible for any vacant position in any of such districts for which such teacher is qualified.

    (105 ILCS 5/24-12) (from Ch. 122, par. 24-12)
    Sec. 24-12. Removal or dismissal of teachers in contractual continued service.
    (a) This subsection (a) applies only to honorable dismissals and recalls in which the notice of dismissal is provided on or before the end of the 2010-2011 school term. If a teacher in contractual continued service is removed or dismissed as a result of a decision of the board to decrease the number of teachers employed by the board or to discontinue some particular type of teaching service, written notice shall be mailed to the teacher and also given the teacher either by certified mail, return receipt requested or personal delivery with receipt at least 60 days before the end of the school term, together with a statement of honorable dismissal and the reason therefor, and in all such cases the board shall first remove or dismiss all teachers who have not entered upon contractual continued service before removing or dismissing any teacher who has entered upon contractual continued service and who is legally qualified to hold a position currently held by a teacher who has not entered upon contractual continued service.
    As between teachers who have entered upon contractual continued service, the teacher or teachers with the shorter length of continuing service with the district shall be dismissed first unless an alternative method of determining the sequence of dismissal is established in a collective bargaining agreement or contract between the board and a professional faculty members' organization and except that this provision shall not impair the operation of any affirmative action program in the district, regardless of whether it exists by operation of law or is conducted on a voluntary basis by the board. Any teacher dismissed as a result of such decrease or discontinuance shall be paid all earned compensation on or before the third business day following the last day of pupil attendance in the regular school term.
    If the board has any vacancies for the following school term or within one calendar year from the beginning of the following school term, the positions thereby becoming available shall be tendered to the teachers so removed or dismissed so far as they are legally qualified to hold such positions; provided, however, that if the number of honorable dismissal notices based on economic necessity exceeds 15% of the number of full-time equivalent positions filled by certified employees (excluding principals and administrative personnel) during the preceding school year, then if the board has any vacancies for the following school term or within 2 calendar years from the beginning of the following school term, the positions so becoming available shall be tendered to the teachers who were so notified and removed or dismissed whenever they are legally qualified to hold such positions. Each board shall, in consultation with any exclusive employee representatives, each year establish a list, categorized by positions, showing the length of continuing service of each teacher who is qualified to hold any such positions, unless an alternative method of determining a sequence of dismissal is established as provided for in this Section, in which case a list shall be made in accordance with the alternative method. Copies of the list shall be distributed to the exclusive employee representative on or before February 1 of each year. Whenever the number of honorable dismissal notices based upon economic necessity exceeds 5, or 150% of the average number of teachers honorably dismissed in the preceding 3 years, whichever is more, then the board also shall hold a public hearing on the question of the dismissals. Following the hearing and board review, the action to approve any such reduction shall require a majority vote of the board members.
    (b) This subsection (b) applies only to honorable dismissals and recalls in which the notice of dismissal is provided during the 2011-2012 school term or a subsequent school term. If any teacher, whether or not in contractual continued service, is removed or dismissed as a result of a decision of a school board to decrease the number of teachers employed by the board, a decision of a school board to discontinue some particular type of teaching service, or a reduction in the number of programs or positions in a special education joint agreement, then written notice must be mailed to the teacher and also given to the teacher either by electronic mail, certified mail, return receipt requested, or personal delivery with receipt at least 45 days before the end of the school term, together with a statement of honorable dismissal and the reason therefor, and in all such cases the sequence of dismissal shall occur in accordance with this subsection (b); except that this subsection (b) shall not impair the operation of any affirmative action program in the school district, regardless of whether it exists by operation of law or is conducted on a voluntary basis by the board.
    Each teacher must be categorized into one or more positions for which the teacher is qualified to hold, based upon legal qualifications and any other qualifications established in a district or joint agreement job description, on or before the May 10 prior to the school year during which the sequence of dismissal is determined. Within each position and subject to agreements made by the joint committee on honorable dismissals that are authorized by subsection (c) of this Section, the school district or joint agreement must establish 4 groupings of teachers qualified to hold the position as follows:
        (1) Grouping one shall consist of each teacher who is
    	
not in contractual continued service and who (i) has not received a performance evaluation rating, (ii) is employed for one school term or less to replace a teacher on leave, or (iii) is employed on a part-time basis. "Part-time basis" for the purposes of this subsection (b) means a teacher who is employed to teach less than a full-day, teacher workload or less than 5 days of the normal student attendance week, unless otherwise provided for in a collective bargaining agreement between the district and the exclusive representative of the district's teachers. For the purposes of this Section, a teacher (A) who is employed as a full-time teacher but who actually teaches or is otherwise present and participating in the district's educational program for less than a school term or (B) who, in the immediately previous school term, was employed on a full-time basis and actually taught or was otherwise present and participated in the district's educational program for 120 days or more is not considered employed on a part-time basis.
        (2) Grouping 2 shall consist of each teacher with a
    	
Needs Improvement or Unsatisfactory performance evaluation rating on either of the teacher's last 2 performance evaluation ratings.
        (3) Grouping 3 shall consist of each teacher with a
    	
performance evaluation rating of at least Satisfactory or Proficient on both of the teacher's last 2 performance evaluation ratings, if 2 ratings are available, or on the teacher's last performance evaluation rating, if only one rating is available, unless the teacher qualifies for placement into grouping 4.
        (4) Grouping 4 shall consist of each teacher whose
    	
last 2 performance evaluation ratings are Excellent and each teacher with 2 Excellent performance evaluation ratings out of the teacher's last 3 performance evaluation ratings with a third rating of Satisfactory or Proficient.
    Among teachers qualified to hold a position, teachers must be dismissed in the order of their groupings, with teachers in grouping one dismissed first and teachers in grouping 4 dismissed last.
    Within grouping one, the sequence of dismissal must be at the discretion of the school district or joint agreement. Within grouping 2, the sequence of dismissal must be based upon average performance evaluation ratings, with the teacher or teachers with the lowest average performance evaluation rating dismissed first. A teacher's average performance evaluation rating must be calculated using the average of the teacher's last 2 performance evaluation ratings, if 2 ratings are available, or the teacher's last performance evaluation rating, if only one rating is available, using the following numerical values: 4 for Excellent; 3 for Proficient or Satisfactory; 2 for Needs Improvement; and 1 for Unsatisfactory. As between or among teachers in grouping 2 with the same average performance evaluation rating and within each of groupings 3 and 4, the teacher or teachers with the shorter length of continuing service with the school district or joint agreement must be dismissed first unless an alternative method of determining the sequence of dismissal is established in a collective bargaining agreement or contract between the board and a professional faculty members' organization.
    Each board, including the governing board of a joint agreement, shall, in consultation with any exclusive employee representatives, each year establish a sequence of honorable dismissal list categorized by positions and the groupings defined in this subsection (b). Copies of the list showing each teacher by name and categorized by positions and the groupings defined in this subsection (b) must be distributed to the exclusive bargaining representative at least 75 days before the end of the school term, provided that the school district or joint agreement may, with notice to any exclusive employee representatives, move teachers from grouping one into another grouping during the period of time from 75 days until 45 days before the end of the school term. Each year, each board shall also establish, in consultation with any exclusive employee representatives, a list showing the length of continuing service of each teacher who is qualified to hold any such positions, unless an alternative method of determining a sequence of dismissal is established as provided for in this Section, in which case a list must be made in accordance with the alternative method. Copies of the list must be distributed to the exclusive employee representative at least 75 days before the end of the school term.
    Any teacher dismissed as a result of such decrease or discontinuance must be paid all earned compensation on or before the third business day following the last day of pupil attendance in the regular school term.
    If the board or joint agreement has any vacancies for the following school term or within one calendar year from the beginning of the following school term, the positions thereby becoming available must be tendered to the teachers so removed or dismissed who were in grouping 3 or 4 of the sequence of dismissal and are qualified to hold the positions, based upon legal qualifications and any other qualifications established in a district or joint agreement job description, on or before the May 10 prior to the date of the positions becoming available, provided that if the number of honorable dismissal notices based on economic necessity exceeds 15% of the number of full-time equivalent positions filled by certified employees (excluding principals and administrative personnel) during the preceding school year, then the recall period is for the following school term or within 2 calendar years from the beginning of the following school term. If the board or joint agreement has any vacancies within the period from the beginning of the following school term through February 1 of the following school term (unless a date later than February 1, but no later than 6 months from the beginning of the following school term, is established in a collective bargaining agreement), the positions thereby becoming available must be tendered to the teachers so removed or dismissed who were in grouping 2 of the sequence of dismissal due to one "needs improvement" rating on either of the teacher's last 2 performance evaluation ratings, provided that, if 2 ratings are available, the other performance evaluation rating used for grouping purposes is "satisfactory", "proficient", or "excellent", and are qualified to hold the positions, based upon legal qualifications and any other qualifications established in a district or joint agreement job description, on or before the May 10 prior to the date of the positions becoming available. On and after July 1, 2014 (the effective date of Public Act 98-648), the preceding sentence shall apply to teachers removed or dismissed by honorable dismissal, even if notice of honorable dismissal occurred during the 2013-2014 school year. Among teachers eligible for recall pursuant to the preceding sentence, the order of recall must be in inverse order of dismissal, unless an alternative order of recall is established in a collective bargaining agreement or contract between the board and a professional faculty members' organization. Whenever the number of honorable dismissal notices based upon economic necessity exceeds 5 notices or 150% of the average number of teachers honorably dismissed in the preceding 3 years, whichever is more, then the school board or governing board of a joint agreement, as applicable, shall also hold a public hearing on the question of the dismissals. Following the hearing and board review, the action to approve any such reduction shall require a majority vote of the board members.
    For purposes of this subsection (b), subject to agreement on an alternative definition reached by the joint committee described in subsection (c) of this Section, a teacher's performance evaluation rating means the overall performance evaluation rating resulting from an annual or biennial performance evaluation conducted pursuant to Article 24A of this Code by the school district or joint agreement determining the sequence of dismissal, not including any performance evaluation conducted during or at the end of a remediation period. No more than one evaluation rating each school term shall be one of the evaluation ratings used for the purpose of determining the sequence of dismissal. Except as otherwise provided in this subsection for any performance evaluations conducted during or at the end of a remediation period, if multiple performance evaluations are conducted in a school term, only the rating from the last evaluation conducted prior to establishing the sequence of honorable dismissal list in such school term shall be the one evaluation rating from that school term used for the purpose of determining the sequence of dismissal. Averaging ratings from multiple evaluations is not permitted unless otherwise agreed to in a collective bargaining agreement or contract between the board and a professional faculty members' organization. The preceding 3 sentences are not a legislative declaration that existing law does or does not already require that only one performance evaluation each school term shall be used for the purpose of determining the sequence of dismissal. For performance evaluation ratings determined prior to September 1, 2012, any school district or joint agreement with a performance evaluation rating system that does not use either of the rating category systems specified in subsection (d) of Section 24A-5 of this Code for all teachers must establish a basis for assigning each teacher a rating that complies with subsection (d) of Section 24A-5 of this Code for all of the performance evaluation ratings that are to be used to determine the sequence of dismissal. A teacher's grouping and ranking on a sequence of honorable dismissal shall be deemed a part of the teacher's performance evaluation, and that information shall be disclosed to the exclusive bargaining representative as part of a sequence of honorable dismissal list, notwithstanding any laws prohibiting disclosure of such information. A performance evaluation rating may be used to determine the sequence of dismissal, notwithstanding the pendency of any grievance resolution or arbitration procedures relating to the performance evaluation. If a teacher has received at least one performance evaluation rating conducted by the school district or joint agreement determining the sequence of dismissal and a subsequent performance evaluation is not conducted in any school year in which such evaluation is required to be conducted under Section 24A-5 of this Code, the teacher's performance evaluation rating for that school year for purposes of determining the sequence of dismissal is deemed Proficient, except that, during any time in which the Governor has declared a disaster due to a public health emergency pursuant to Section 7 of the Illinois Emergency Management Agency Act, this default to Proficient does not apply to any teacher who has entered into contractual continued service and who was deemed Excellent on his or her most recent evaluation. During any time in which the Governor has declared a disaster due to a public health emergency pursuant to Section 7 of the Illinois Emergency Management Agency Act and unless the school board and any exclusive bargaining representative have completed the performance rating for teachers or have mutually agreed to an alternate performance rating, any teacher who has entered into contractual continued service, whose most recent evaluation was deemed Excellent, and whose performance evaluation is not conducted when the evaluation is required to be conducted shall receive a teacher's performance rating deemed Excellent. A school board and any exclusive bargaining representative may mutually agree to an alternate performance rating for teachers not in contractual continued service during any time in which the Governor has declared a disaster due to a public health emergency pursuant to Section 7 of the Illinois Emergency Management Agency Act, as long as the agreement is in writing. If a performance evaluation rating is nullified as the result of an arbitration, administrative agency, or court determination, then the school district or joint agreement is deemed to have conducted a performance evaluation for that school year, but the performance evaluation rating may not be used in determining the sequence of dismissal.
    Nothing in this subsection (b) shall be construed as limiting the right of a school board or governing board of a joint agreement to dismiss a teacher not in contractual continued service in accordance with Section 24-11 of this Code.
    Any provisions regarding the sequence of honorable dismissals and recall of honorably dismissed teachers in a collective bargaining agreement entered into on or before January 1, 2011 and in effect on June 13, 2011 (the effective date of Public Act 97-8) that may conflict with Public Act 97-8 shall remain in effect through the expiration of such agreement or June 30, 2013, whichever is earlier.
    (c) Each school district and special education joint agreement must use a joint committee composed of equal representation selected by the school board and its teachers or, if applicable, the exclusive bargaining representative of its teachers, to address the matters described in paragraphs (1) through (5) of this subsection (c) pertaining to honorable dismissals under subsection (b) of this Section.
        (1) The joint committee must consider and may agree
    	
to criteria for excluding from grouping 2 and placing into grouping 3 a teacher whose last 2 performance evaluations include a Needs Improvement and either a Proficient or Excellent.
        (2) The joint committee must consider and may agree
    	
to an alternative definition for grouping 4, which definition must take into account prior performance evaluation ratings and may take into account other factors that relate to the school district's or program's educational objectives. An alternative definition for grouping 4 may not permit the inclusion of a teacher in the grouping with a Needs Improvement or Unsatisfactory performance evaluation rating on either of the teacher's last 2 performance evaluation ratings.
        (3) The joint committee may agree to including within
    	
the definition of a performance evaluation rating a performance evaluation rating administered by a school district or joint agreement other than the school district or joint agreement determining the sequence of dismissal.
        (4) For each school district or joint agreement that
    	
administers performance evaluation ratings that are inconsistent with either of the rating category systems specified in subsection (d) of Section 24A-5 of this Code, the school district or joint agreement must consult with the joint committee on the basis for assigning a rating that complies with subsection (d) of Section 24A-5 of this Code to each performance evaluation rating that will be used in a sequence of dismissal.
        (5) Upon request by a joint committee member
    	
submitted to the employing board by no later than 10 days after the distribution of the sequence of honorable dismissal list, a representative of the employing board shall, within 5 days after the request, provide to members of the joint committee a list showing the most recent and prior performance evaluation ratings of each teacher identified only by length of continuing service in the district or joint agreement and not by name. If, after review of this list, a member of the joint committee has a good faith belief that a disproportionate number of teachers with greater length of continuing service with the district or joint agreement have received a recent performance evaluation rating lower than the prior rating, the member may request that the joint committee review the list to assess whether such a trend may exist. Following the joint committee's review, but by no later than the end of the applicable school term, the joint committee or any member or members of the joint committee may submit a report of the review to the employing board and exclusive bargaining representative, if any. Nothing in this paragraph (5) shall impact the order of honorable dismissal or a school district's or joint agreement's authority to carry out a dismissal in accordance with subsection (b) of this Section.
    Agreement by the joint committee as to a matter requires the majority vote of all committee members, and if the joint committee does not reach agreement on a matter, then the otherwise applicable requirements of subsection (b) of this Section shall apply. Except as explicitly set forth in this subsection (c), a joint committee has no authority to agree to any further modifications to the requirements for honorable dismissals set forth in subsection (b) of this Section. The joint committee must be established, and the first meeting of the joint committee each school year must occur on or before December 1.
    The joint committee must reach agreement on a matter on or before February 1 of a school year in order for the agreement of the joint committee to apply to the sequence of dismissal determined during that school year. Subject to the February 1 deadline for agreements, the agreement of a joint committee on a matter shall apply to the sequence of dismissal until the agreement is amended or terminated by the joint committee.
    The provisions of the Open Meetings Act shall not apply to meetings of a joint committee created under this subsection (c).
    (d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this subsection (d), the requirements and dismissal procedures of Section 24-16.5 of this Code shall apply to any dismissal sought under Section 24-16.5 of this Code.
        (1) If a dismissal of a teacher in contractual
    	
continued service is sought for any reason or cause other than an honorable dismissal under subsections (a) or (b) of this Section or a dismissal sought under Section 24-16.5 of this Code, including those under Section 10-22.4, the board must first approve a motion containing specific charges by a majority vote of all its members. Written notice of such charges, including a bill of particulars and the teacher's right to request a hearing, must be mailed to the teacher and also given to the teacher either by electronic mail, certified mail, return receipt requested, or personal delivery with receipt within 5 days of the adoption of the motion. Any written notice sent on or after July 1, 2012 shall inform the teacher of the right to request a hearing before a mutually selected hearing officer, with the cost of the hearing officer split equally between the teacher and the board, or a hearing before a board-selected hearing officer, with the cost of the hearing officer paid by the board.
        Before setting a hearing on charges stemming from
    	
causes that are considered remediable, a board must give the teacher reasonable warning in writing, stating specifically the causes that, if not removed, may result in charges; however, no such written warning is required if the causes have been the subject of a remediation plan pursuant to Article 24A of this Code.
        If, in the opinion of the board, the interests of the
    	
school require it, the board may suspend the teacher without pay, pending the hearing, but if the board's dismissal or removal is not sustained, the teacher shall not suffer the loss of any salary or benefits by reason of the suspension.
        (2) No hearing upon the charges is required unless
    	
the teacher within 17 days after receiving notice requests in writing of the board that a hearing be scheduled before a mutually selected hearing officer or a hearing officer selected by the board. The secretary of the school board shall forward a copy of the notice to the State Board of Education.
        (3) Within 5 business days after receiving a notice
    	
of hearing in which either notice to the teacher was sent before July 1, 2012 or, if the notice was sent on or after July 1, 2012, the teacher has requested a hearing before a mutually selected hearing officer, the State Board of Education shall provide a list of 5 prospective, impartial hearing officers from the master list of qualified, impartial hearing officers maintained by the State Board of Education. Each person on the master list must (i) be accredited by a national arbitration organization and have had a minimum of 5 years of experience directly related to labor and employment relations matters between employers and employees or their exclusive bargaining representatives and (ii) beginning September 1, 2012, have participated in training provided or approved by the State Board of Education for teacher dismissal hearing officers so that he or she is familiar with issues generally involved in evaluative and non-evaluative dismissals.
        If notice to the teacher was sent before July 1, 2012
    	
or, if the notice was sent on or after July 1, 2012, the teacher has requested a hearing before a mutually selected hearing officer, the board and the teacher or their legal representatives within 3 business days shall alternately strike one name from the list provided by the State Board of Education until only one name remains. Unless waived by the teacher, the teacher shall have the right to proceed first with the striking. Within 3 business days of receipt of the list provided by the State Board of Education, the board and the teacher or their legal representatives shall each have the right to reject all prospective hearing officers named on the list and notify the State Board of Education of such rejection. Within 3 business days after receiving this notification, the State Board of Education shall appoint a qualified person from the master list who did not appear on the list sent to the parties to serve as the hearing officer, unless the parties notify it that they have chosen to alternatively select a hearing officer under paragraph (4) of this subsection (d).
        If the teacher has requested a hearing before a
    	
hearing officer selected by the board, the board shall select one name from the master list of qualified impartial hearing officers maintained by the State Board of Education within 3 business days after receipt and shall notify the State Board of Education of its selection.
        A hearing officer mutually selected by the parties,
    	
selected by the board, or selected through an alternative selection process under paragraph (4) of this subsection (d) (A) must not be a resident of the school district, (B) must be available to commence the hearing within 75 days and conclude the hearing within 120 days after being selected as the hearing officer, and (C) must issue a decision as to whether the teacher must be dismissed and give a copy of that decision to both the teacher and the board within 30 days from the conclusion of the hearing or closure of the record, whichever is later.
        If the Governor has declared a disaster due to a
    	
public health emergency pursuant to Section 7 of the Illinois Emergency Management Agency Act and except if the parties mutually agree otherwise and the agreement is in writing, the requirements of this Section pertaining to prehearings and hearings are paused and do not begin to toll until the proclamation is no longer in effect. If mutually agreed to and reduced to writing, the parties may proceed with the prehearing and hearing requirements of this Section and may also agree to extend the timelines of this Section connected to the appointment and selection of a hearing officer and those connected to commencing and concluding a hearing. Any hearing convened during a public health emergency pursuant to Section 7 of the Illinois Emergency Management Agency Act may be convened remotely. Any hearing officer for a hearing convened during a public health emergency pursuant to Section 7 of the Illinois Emergency Management Agency Act may voluntarily withdraw from the hearing and another hearing officer shall be selected or appointed pursuant to this Section.
        (4) In the alternative to selecting a hearing
    	
officer from the list received from the State Board of Education or accepting the appointment of a hearing officer by the State Board of Education or if the State Board of Education cannot provide a list or appoint a hearing officer that meets the foregoing requirements, the board and the teacher or their legal representatives may mutually agree to select an impartial hearing officer who is not on the master list either by direct appointment by the parties or by using procedures for the appointment of an arbitrator established by the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service or the American Arbitration Association. The parties shall notify the State Board of Education of their intent to select a hearing officer using an alternative procedure within 3 business days of receipt of a list of prospective hearing officers provided by the State Board of Education, notice of appointment of a hearing officer by the State Board of Education, or receipt of notice from the State Board of Education that it cannot provide a list that meets the foregoing requirements, whichever is later.
        (5) If the notice of dismissal was sent to the
    	
teacher before July 1, 2012, the fees and costs for the hearing officer must be paid by the State Board of Education. If the notice of dismissal was sent to the teacher on or after July 1, 2012, the hearing officer's fees and costs must be paid as follows in this paragraph (5). The fees and permissible costs for the hearing officer must be determined by the State Board of Education. If the board and the teacher or their legal representatives mutually agree to select an impartial hearing officer who is not on a list received from the State Board of Education, they may agree to supplement the fees determined by the State Board to the hearing officer, at a rate consistent with the hearing officer's published professional fees. If the hearing officer is mutually selected by the parties, then the board and the teacher or their legal representatives shall each pay 50% of the fees and costs and any supplemental allowance to which they agree. If the hearing officer is selected by the board, then the board shall pay 100% of the hearing officer's fees and costs. The fees and costs must be paid to the hearing officer within 14 days after the board and the teacher or their legal representatives receive the hearing officer's decision set forth in paragraph (7) of this subsection (d).
        (6) The teacher is required to answer the bill of
    	
particulars and aver affirmative matters in his or her defense, and the time for initially doing so and the time for updating such answer and defenses after pre-hearing discovery must be set by the hearing officer. The State Board of Education shall promulgate rules so that each party has a fair opportunity to present its case and to ensure that the dismissal process proceeds in a fair and expeditious manner. These rules shall address, without limitation, discovery and hearing scheduling conferences; the teacher's initial answer and affirmative defenses to the bill of particulars and the updating of that information after pre-hearing discovery; provision for written interrogatories and requests for production of documents; the requirement that each party initially disclose to the other party and then update the disclosure no later than 10 calendar days prior to the commencement of the hearing, the names and addresses of persons who may be called as witnesses at the hearing, a summary of the facts or opinions each witness will testify to, and all other documents and materials, including information maintained electronically, relevant to its own as well as the other party's case (the hearing officer may exclude witnesses and exhibits not identified and shared, except those offered in rebuttal for which the party could not reasonably have anticipated prior to the hearing); pre-hearing discovery and preparation, including provision for written interrogatories and requests for production of documents, provided that discovery depositions are prohibited; the conduct of the hearing; the right of each party to be represented by counsel, the offer of evidence and witnesses and the cross-examination of witnesses; the authority of the hearing officer to issue subpoenas and subpoenas duces tecum, provided that the hearing officer may limit the number of witnesses to be subpoenaed on behalf of each party to no more than 7; the length of post-hearing briefs; and the form, length, and content of hearing officers' decisions. The hearing officer shall hold a hearing and render a final decision for dismissal pursuant to Article 24A of this Code or shall report to the school board findings of fact and a recommendation as to whether or not the teacher must be dismissed for conduct. The hearing officer shall commence the hearing within 75 days and conclude the hearing within 120 days after being selected as the hearing officer, provided that the hearing officer may modify these timelines upon the showing of good cause or mutual agreement of the parties. Good cause for the purpose of this subsection (d) shall mean the illness or otherwise unavoidable emergency of the teacher, district representative, their legal representatives, the hearing officer, or an essential witness as indicated in each party's pre-hearing submission. In a dismissal hearing pursuant to Article 24A of this Code in which a witness is a student or is under the age of 18, the hearing officer must make accommodations for the witness, as provided under paragraph (6.5) of this subsection. The hearing officer shall consider and give weight to all of the teacher's evaluations written pursuant to Article 24A that are relevant to the issues in the hearing.
        Each party shall have no more than 3 days to present
    	
its case, unless extended by the hearing officer to enable a party to present adequate evidence and testimony, including due to the other party's cross-examination of the party's witnesses, for good cause or by mutual agreement of the parties. The State Board of Education shall define in rules the meaning of "day" for such purposes. All testimony at the hearing shall be taken under oath administered by the hearing officer. The hearing officer shall cause a record of the proceedings to be kept and shall employ a competent reporter to take stenographic or stenotype notes of all the testimony. The costs of the reporter's attendance and services at the hearing shall be paid by the party or parties who are responsible for paying the fees and costs of the hearing officer. Either party desiring a transcript of the hearing shall pay for the cost thereof. Any post-hearing briefs must be submitted by the parties by no later than 21 days after a party's receipt of the transcript of the hearing, unless extended by the hearing officer for good cause or by mutual agreement of the parties.
        (6.5) In the case of charges involving sexual abuse
    	
or severe physical abuse of a student or a person under the age of 18, the hearing officer shall make alternative hearing procedures to protect a witness who is a student or who is under the age of 18 from being intimidated or traumatized. Alternative hearing procedures may include, but are not limited to: (i) testimony made via a telecommunication device in a location other than the hearing room and outside the physical presence of the teacher and other hearing participants, (ii) testimony outside the physical presence of the teacher, or (iii) non-public testimony. During a testimony described under this subsection, each party must be permitted to ask a witness who is a student or who is under 18 years of age all relevant questions and follow-up questions. All questions must exclude evidence of the witness' sexual behavior or predisposition, unless the evidence is offered to prove that someone other than the teacher subject to the dismissal hearing engaged in the charge at issue.
        (7) The hearing officer shall, within 30 days from
    	
the conclusion of the hearing or closure of the record, whichever is later, make a decision as to whether or not the teacher shall be dismissed pursuant to Article 24A of this Code or report to the school board findings of fact and a recommendation as to whether or not the teacher shall be dismissed for cause and shall give a copy of the decision or findings of fact and recommendation to both the teacher and the school board. If a hearing officer fails without good cause, specifically provided in writing to both parties and the State Board of Education, to render a decision or findings of fact and recommendation within 30 days after the hearing is concluded or the record is closed, whichever is later, the parties may mutually agree to select a hearing officer pursuant to the alternative procedure, as provided in this Section, to rehear the charges heard by the hearing officer who failed to render a decision or findings of fact and recommendation or to review the record and render a decision. If any hearing officer fails without good cause, specifically provided in writing to both parties and the State Board of Education, to render a decision or findings of fact and recommendation within 30 days after the hearing is concluded or the record is closed, whichever is later, the hearing officer shall be removed from the master list of hearing officers maintained by the State Board of Education for not more than 24 months. The parties and the State Board of Education may also take such other actions as it deems appropriate, including recovering, reducing, or withholding any fees paid or to be paid to the hearing officer. If any hearing officer repeats such failure, he or she must be permanently removed from the master list maintained by the State Board of Education and may not be selected by parties through the alternative selection process under this paragraph (7) or paragraph (4) of this subsection (d). The board shall not lose jurisdiction to discharge a teacher if the hearing officer fails to render a decision or findings of fact and recommendation within the time specified in this Section. If the decision of the hearing officer for dismissal pursuant to Article 24A of this Code or of the school board for dismissal for cause is in favor of the teacher, then the hearing officer or school board shall order reinstatement to the same or substantially equivalent position and shall determine the amount for which the school board is liable, including, but not limited to, loss of income and benefits.
        (8) The school board, within 45 days after receipt
    	
of the hearing officer's findings of fact and recommendation as to whether (i) the conduct at issue occurred, (ii) the conduct that did occur was remediable, and (iii) the proposed dismissal should be sustained, shall issue a written order as to whether the teacher must be retained or dismissed for cause from its employ. The school board's written order shall incorporate the hearing officer's findings of fact, except that the school board may modify or supplement the findings of fact if, in its opinion, the findings of fact are against the manifest weight of the evidence.
        If the school board dismisses the teacher
    	
notwithstanding the hearing officer's findings of fact and recommendation, the school board shall make a conclusion in its written order, giving its reasons therefor, and such conclusion and reasons must be included in its written order. The failure of the school board to strictly adhere to the timelines contained in this Section shall not render it without jurisdiction to dismiss the teacher. The school board shall not lose jurisdiction to discharge the teacher for cause if the hearing officer fails to render a recommendation within the time specified in this Section. The decision of the school board is final, unless reviewed as provided in paragraph (9) of this subsection (d).
        If the school board retains the teacher, the school
    	
board shall enter a written order stating the amount of back pay and lost benefits, less mitigation, to be paid to the teacher, within 45 days after its retention order. Should the teacher object to the amount of the back pay and lost benefits or amount mitigated, the teacher shall give written objections to the amount within 21 days. If the parties fail to reach resolution within 7 days, the dispute shall be referred to the hearing officer, who shall consider the school board's written order and teacher's written objection and determine the amount to which the school board is liable. The costs of the hearing officer's review and determination must be paid by the board.
        (9) The decision of the hearing officer pursuant to
    	
Article 24A of this Code or of the school board's decision to dismiss for cause is final unless reviewed as provided in Section 24-16 of this Code. If the school board's decision to dismiss for cause is contrary to the hearing officer's recommendation, the court on review shall give consideration to the school board's decision and its supplemental findings of fact, if applicable, and the hearing officer's findings of fact and recommendation in making its decision. In the event such review is instituted, the school board shall be responsible for preparing and filing the record of proceedings, and such costs associated therewith must be divided equally between the parties.
        (10) If a decision of the hearing officer for
    	
dismissal pursuant to Article 24A of this Code or of the school board for dismissal for cause is adjudicated upon review or appeal in favor of the teacher, then the trial court shall order reinstatement and shall remand the matter to the school board with direction for entry of an order setting the amount of back pay, lost benefits, and costs, less mitigation. The teacher may challenge the school board's order setting the amount of back pay, lost benefits, and costs, less mitigation, through an expedited arbitration procedure, with the costs of the arbitrator borne by the school board.
        Any teacher who is reinstated by any hearing or
    	
adjudication brought under this Section shall be assigned by the board to a position substantially similar to the one which that teacher held prior to that teacher's suspension or dismissal.
        (11) Subject to any later effective date referenced
    	
in this Section for a specific aspect of the dismissal process, the changes made by Public Act 97-8 shall apply to dismissals instituted on or after September 1, 2011. Any dismissal instituted prior to September 1, 2011 must be carried out in accordance with the requirements of this Section prior to amendment by Public Act 97-8.
    (e) Nothing contained in Public Act 98-648 repeals, supersedes, invalidates, or nullifies final decisions in lawsuits pending on July 1, 2014 (the effective date of Public Act 98-648) in Illinois courts involving the interpretation of Public Act 97-8.

The contractual continued service status of a teacher is not affected by his attained age, promotion, absence caused by temporary illness or temporary incapacity as defined by regulations of the employing board, leave of absence mutually agreed upon between the teacher and the board, or because of absence while in the military service of the United States. If a teacher is elected to serve in the General Assembly, the board shall grant him a leave of absence if he so requests.

    By mutual agreement of a teacher and the employing board, the board may, but is not required to, grant the teacher a leave of absence to accept employment in a Department of Defense overseas dependents' school. If such a leave of absence is granted, the teacher may elect, for a period not exceeding the lesser of the period for which he is so employed or 5 years, (a) to preserve his contractual continued service status under this Act, and (b) to continue receipt, on the same basis as if he were teaching in the school system subject to the employing board, of service credit earned for requirements of promotion, incremental increases in salary, leaves of absence and other privileges based on an established period of service or employment. In addition, a teacher whose armed forces reserve unit is activated during the school year and who as a result is required to enter into active military service duty shall continue to have his or her full salary as a teacher paid by the school board for the first 2 weeks of the period during which he or she is required to remain on active military service duty; provided, however, that if the teacher is required to remain on active military service duty for any additional period, his or her contractual continued service under this Act shall be preserved, and he or she shall continue to receive throughout the entire period that he or she is required to remain on active military service duty, on the same basis as if he or she were teaching in the school system governed by the employing board, service credit earned for requirements of promotion, incremental increases in salary, leaves of absence and other privileges based on an established period of service or employment; provided further that a teacher who receives payment of his or her full salary as a teacher for the first 2 weeks of the period his or her armed forces reserve unit is required to remain on active military service duty shall return to the school board such portion of his or her teaching salary so paid as is equal to the payment he or she received for such 2 week period from his or her armed forces reserve unit, excluding, however, all payments received by the teacher from the armed forces reserve unit which are allocable to nonschool days or which constitute a travel, meal or housing allowance.

Any teacher terminating said service not in accordance with this Section may be referred by the board to the State Superintendent of Education. The State Superintendent or his or her designee shall convene an informal evidentiary hearing no later than 90 days after receipt of a resolution by the board. If the State Superintendent or his or her designee finds that the teacher resigned during the school term without the concurrence of the board to accept another teaching assignment, the State Superintendent must suspend the teacher's license for one calendar year. In lieu of a hearing and finding, the teacher may agree to a lesser licensure sanction at the discretion of the State Superintendent.

    (105 ILCS 5/24-16.5)
    Sec. 24-16.5. Optional alternative evaluative dismissal process for PERA evaluations.
    (a) As used in this Section:
    "Applicable hearing requirements" means (i) for any school district having less than 500,000 inhabitants or a program of a special education joint agreement, those procedures and requirements relating to a teacher's request for a hearing, selection of a hearing officer, pre-hearing and hearing procedures, and post-hearing briefs set forth in paragraphs (1) through (6) of subsection (d) of Section 24-12 of this Code or (ii) for a school district having 500,000 inhabitants or more, those procedures and requirements relating to a teacher's request for a hearing, selection of a hearing officer, pre-hearing and hearing procedures, and post-hearing briefs set forth in paragraphs (1) through (5) of subsection (a) of Section 34-85 of this Code.
    "Board" means, for a school district having less than 500,000 inhabitants or a program of a special education joint agreement, the board of directors, board of education, or board of school inspectors, as the case may be. For a school district having 500,000 inhabitants or more, "board" means the Chicago Board of Education.
    "Evaluator" means an evaluator, as defined in Section 24A-2.5 of this Code, who has successfully completed the pre-qualification program described in subsection (b) of Section 24A-3 of this Code.
    "PERA-trained board member" means a member of a board that has completed a training program on PERA evaluations either administered or approved by the State Board of Education.
    "PERA evaluation" means a performance evaluation of a teacher after the implementation date of an evaluation system for teachers, as specified by Section 24A-2.5 of this Code, using a performance evaluation instrument and process that meets the minimum requirements for teacher evaluation instruments and processes set forth in rules adopted by the State Board of Education to implement Public Act 96-861.
    "Remediation" means the remediation plan, mid-point and final evaluations, and related processes and requirements set forth in subdivisions (i), (j), and (k) of Section 24A-5 of this Code.
    "School district" means a school district or a program of a special education joint agreement.
    "Second evaluator" means an evaluator who either conducts the mid-point and final remediation evaluation or conducts an independent assessment of whether the teacher completed the remediation plan with a rating equal to or better than a "Proficient" rating, all in accordance with subdivision (c) of this Section.
    "Student growth components" means the components of a performance evaluation plan described in subdivision (c) of Section 24A-5 of this Code, as may be supplemented by administrative rules adopted by the State Board of Education.
    "Teacher practice components" means the components of a performance evaluation plan described in subdivisions (a) and (b) of Section 24A-5 of this Code, as may be supplemented by administrative rules adopted by the State Board of Education.
    "Teacher representatives" means the exclusive bargaining representative of a school district's teachers or, if no exclusive bargaining representatives exists, a representative committee selected by teachers.
    (b) This Section applies to all school districts, including those having 500,000 or more inhabitants. The optional dismissal process set forth in this Section is an alternative to those set forth in Sections 24-12 and 34-85 of this Code. Nothing in this Section is intended to change the existing practices or precedents under Section 24-12 or 34-85 of this Code, nor shall this Section be interpreted as implying standards and procedures that should or must be used as part of a remediation that precedes a dismissal sought under Section 24-12 or 34-85 of this Code.
    A board may dismiss a teacher who has entered upon contractual continued service under this Section if the following are met:
        (1) the cause of dismissal is that the teacher has
    	
failed to complete a remediation plan with a rating equal to or better than a "Proficient" rating;
        (2) the "Unsatisfactory" performance evaluation
    	
rating that preceded remediation resulted from a PERA evaluation; and
        (3) the school district has complied with subsection
    	
(c) of this Section.
    A school district may not, through agreement with a teacher or its teacher representatives, waive its right to dismiss a teacher under this Section.
    (c) Each school district electing to use the dismissal process set forth in this Section must comply with the pre-remediation and remediation activities and requirements set forth in this subsection (c).
        (1) Before a school district's first remediation
    	
relating to a dismissal under this Section, the school district must create and establish a list of at least 2 evaluators who will be available to serve as second evaluators under this Section. The school district shall provide its teacher representatives with an opportunity to submit additional names of teacher evaluators who will be available to serve as second evaluators and who will be added to the list created and established by the school district, provided that, unless otherwise agreed to by the school district, the teacher representatives may not submit more teacher evaluators for inclusion on the list than the number of evaluators submitted by the school district. Each teacher evaluator must either have (i) National Board of Professional Teaching Standards certification, with no "Unsatisfactory" or "Needs Improvement" performance evaluating ratings in his or her 2 most recent performance evaluation ratings; or (ii) "Excellent" performance evaluation ratings in 2 of his or her 3 most recent performance evaluations, with no "Needs Improvement" or "Unsatisfactory" performance evaluation ratings in his or her last 3 ratings. If the teacher representatives do not submit a list of teacher evaluators within 21 days after the school district's request, the school district may proceed with a remediation using a list that includes only the school district's selections. Either the school district or the teacher representatives may revise or add to their selections for the list at any time with notice to the other party, subject to the limitations set forth in this paragraph (1).
        (2) Before a school district's first remediation
    	
relating to a dismissal under this Section, the school district shall, in good faith cooperation with its teacher representatives, establish a process for the selection of a second evaluator from the list created pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subsection (c). Such process may be amended at any time in good faith cooperation with the teacher representatives. If the teacher representatives are given an opportunity to cooperate with the school district and elect not to do so, the school district may, at its discretion, establish or amend the process for selection. Before the hearing officer and as part of any judicial review of a dismissal under this Section, a teacher may not challenge a remediation or dismissal on the grounds that the process used by the school district to select a second evaluator was not established in good faith cooperation with its teacher representatives.
        (3) For each remediation preceding a dismissal under
    	
this Section, the school district shall select a second evaluator from the list of second evaluators created pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subsection (c), using the selection process established pursuant to paragraph (2) of this subsection (c). The selected second evaluator may not be the same individual who determined the teacher's "Unsatisfactory" performance evaluation rating preceding remediation, and, if the second evaluator is an administrator, may not be a direct report to the individual who determined the teacher's "Unsatisfactory" performance evaluation rating preceding remediation. The school district's authority to select a second evaluator from the list of second evaluators must not be delegated or limited through any agreement with the teacher representatives, provided that nothing shall prohibit a school district and its teacher representatives from agreeing to a formal peer evaluation process as permitted under Article 24A of this Code that could be used to meet the requirements for the selection of second evaluators under this subsection (c).
        (4) The second evaluator selected pursuant to
    	
paragraph (3) of this subsection (c) must either (i) conduct the mid-point and final evaluation during remediation or (ii) conduct an independent assessment of whether the teacher completed the remediation plan with a rating equal to or better than a "Proficient" rating, which independent assessment shall include, but is not limited to, personal or video-recorded observations of the teacher that relate to the teacher practice components of the remediation plan. Nothing in this subsection (c) shall be construed to limit or preclude the participation of the evaluator who rated a teacher as "Unsatisfactory" in remediation.
    (d) To institute a dismissal proceeding under this Section, the board must first provide written notice to the teacher within 30 days after the completion of the final remediation evaluation. The notice shall comply with the applicable hearing requirements and, in addition, must specify that dismissal is sought under this Section and include a copy of each performance evaluation relating to the scope of the hearing as described in this subsection (d).
    The applicable hearing requirements shall apply to the teacher's request for a hearing, the selection and qualifications of the hearing officer, and pre-hearing and hearing procedures, except that all of the following must be met:
        (1) The hearing officer must, in addition to meeting
    	
the qualifications set forth in the applicable hearing requirements, have successfully completed the pre-qualification program described in subsection (b) of Section 24A-3 of this Code, unless the State Board of Education waives this requirement to provide an adequate pool of hearing officers for consideration.
        (2) The scope of the hearing must be limited as
    	
follows:
            (A) The school district must demonstrate the
        	
following:
                (i) that the "Unsatisfactory" performance
            	
evaluation rating that preceded remediation applied the teacher practice components and student growth components and determined an overall evaluation rating of "Unsatisfactory" in accordance with the standards and requirements of the school district's evaluation plan;
                (ii) that the remediation plan complied with
            	
the requirements of Section 24A-5 of this Code;
                (iii) that the teacher failed to complete the
            	
remediation plan with a performance evaluation rating equal to or better than a "Proficient" rating, based upon a final remediation evaluation meeting the applicable standards and requirements of the school district's evaluation plan; and
                (iv) that if the second evaluator selected
            	
pursuant to paragraph (3) of subsection (c) of this Section does not conduct the mid-point and final evaluation and makes an independent assessment that the teacher completed the remediation plan with a rating equal to or better than a "Proficient" rating, the school district must demonstrate that the final remediation evaluation is a more valid assessment of the teacher's performance than the assessment made by the second evaluator.
            (B) The teacher may only challenge the
        	
substantive and procedural aspects of (i) the "Unsatisfactory" performance evaluation rating that led to the remediation, (ii) the remediation plan, and (iii) the final remediation evaluation. To the extent the teacher challenges procedural aspects, including any in applicable collective bargaining agreement provisions, of a relevant performance evaluation rating or the remediation plan, the teacher must demonstrate how an alleged procedural defect materially affected the teacher's ability to demonstrate a level of performance necessary to avoid remediation or dismissal or successfully complete the remediation plan. Without any such material effect, a procedural defect shall not impact the assessment by the hearing officer, board, or reviewing court of the validity of a performance evaluation or a remediation plan.
            (C) The hearing officer shall only consider and
        	
give weight to performance evaluations relevant to the scope of the hearing as described in clauses (A) and (B) of this subdivision (2).
        (3) Each party shall be given only 2 days to present
    	
evidence and testimony relating to the scope of the hearing, unless a longer period is mutually agreed to by the parties or deemed necessary by the hearing officer to enable a party to present adequate evidence and testimony to address the scope of the hearing, including due to the other party's cross-examination of the party's witnesses.
    (e) The provisions of Sections 24-12 and 34-85 pertaining to the decision or recommendation of the hearing officer do not apply to dismissal proceedings under this Section. For any dismissal proceedings under this Section, the hearing officer shall not issue a decision, and shall issue only findings of fact and a recommendation, including the reasons therefor, to the board to either retain or dismiss the teacher and shall give a copy of the report to both the teacher and the superintendent of the school district. The hearing officer's findings of fact and recommendation must be issued within 30 days from the close of the record of the hearing.
    The State Board of Education shall adopt rules regarding the length of the hearing officer's findings of fact and recommendation. If a hearing officer fails without good cause, specifically provided in writing to both parties and the State Board of Education, to render a recommendation within 30 days after the hearing is concluded or the record is closed, whichever is later, the parties may mutually agree to select a hearing officer pursuant to the alternative procedure, as provided in Section 24-12 or 34-85, to rehear the charges heard by the hearing officer who failed to render a recommendation or to review the record and render a recommendation. If any hearing officer fails without good cause, specifically provided in writing to both parties and the State Board of Education, to render a recommendation within 30 days after the hearing is concluded or the record is closed, whichever is later, the hearing officer shall be removed from the master list of hearing officers maintained by the State Board of Education for not more than 24 months. The parties and the State Board of Education may also take such other actions as it deems appropriate, including recovering, reducing, or withholding any fees paid or to be paid to the hearing officer. If any hearing officer repeats such failure, he or she shall be permanently removed from the master list of hearing officers maintained by the State Board of Education.
    (f) The board, within 45 days after receipt of the hearing officer's findings of fact and recommendation, shall decide, through adoption of a written order, whether the teacher must be dismissed from its employ or retained, provided that only PERA-trained board members may participate in the vote with respect to the decision.
    If the board dismisses the teacher notwithstanding the hearing officer's recommendation of retention, the board shall make a conclusion, giving its reasons therefor, and such conclusion and reasons must be included in its written order. The failure of the board to strictly adhere to the timelines contained in this Section does not render it without jurisdiction to dismiss the teacher. The board shall not lose jurisdiction to discharge the teacher if the hearing officer fails to render a recommendation within the time specified in this Section. The decision of the board is final, unless reviewed as provided in subsection (g) of this Section.
    If the board retains the teacher, the board shall enter a written order stating the amount of back pay and lost benefits, less mitigation, to be paid to the teacher, within 45 days of its retention order.
    (g) A teacher dismissed under this Section may apply for and obtain judicial review of a decision of the board in accordance with the provisions of the Administrative Review Law, except as follows:
        (1) for a teacher dismissed by a school district
    	
having 500,000 inhabitants or more, such judicial review must be taken directly to the appellate court of the judicial district in which the board maintains its primary administrative office, and any direct appeal to the appellate court must be filed within 35 days from the date that a copy of the decision sought to be reviewed was served upon the teacher;
        (2) for a teacher dismissed by a school district
    	
having less than 500,000 inhabitants after the hearing officer recommended dismissal, such judicial review must be taken directly to the appellate court of the judicial district in which the board maintains its primary administrative office, and any direct appeal to the appellate court must be filed within 35 days from the date that a copy of the decision sought to be reviewed was served upon the teacher; and
        (3) for all school districts, if the hearing officer
    	
recommended dismissal, the decision of the board may be reversed only if it is found to be arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or not in accordance with law.
    In the event judicial review is instituted by a teacher, any costs of preparing and filing the record of proceedings must be paid by the teacher. If a decision of the board is adjudicated upon judicial review in favor of the teacher, then the court shall remand the matter to the board with direction for entry of an order setting the amount of back pay, lost benefits, and costs, less mitigation. The teacher may challenge the board's order setting the amount of back pay, lost benefits, and costs, less mitigation, through an expedited arbitration procedure with the costs of the arbitrator borne by the board.

    (a) As used in this and the succeeding Sections, "teacher" means any and all school district employees regularly required to be certified under laws relating to the certification of teachers. Each school district shall develop, in cooperation with its teachers or, where applicable, the exclusive bargaining representatives of its teachers, an evaluation plan for all teachers.
    (b) By no later than the applicable implementation date, each school district shall, in good faith cooperation with its teachers or, where applicable, the exclusive bargaining representatives of its teachers, incorporate the use of data and indicators on student growth as a significant factor in rating teaching performance, into its evaluation plan for all teachers, both those teachers in contractual continued service and those teachers not in contractual continued service. The plan shall at least meet the standards and requirements for student growth and teacher evaluation established under Section 24A-7, and specifically describe how student growth data and indicators will be used as part of the evaluation process, how this information will relate to evaluation standards, the assessments or other indicators of student performance that will be used in measuring student growth and the weight that each will have, the methodology that will be used to measure student growth, and the criteria other than student growth that will be used in evaluating the teacher and the weight that each will have.

    (105 ILCS 5/24A-5) (from Ch. 122, par. 24A-5)
    Sec. 24A-5. Content of evaluation plans. This Section does not apply to teachers assigned to schools identified in an agreement entered into between the board of a school district operating under Article 34 of this Code and the exclusive representative of the district's teachers in accordance with Section 34-85c of this Code.
    Each school district to which this Article applies shall establish a teacher evaluation plan which ensures that each teacher in contractual continued service is evaluated at least once in the course of every 2 school years.
    By no later than September 1, 2012, each school district shall establish a teacher evaluation plan that ensures that:
        (1) each teacher not in contractual continued service
    	
is evaluated at least once every school year; and
        (2) each teacher in contractual continued service is
    	
evaluated at least once in the course of every 2 school years. However, any teacher in contractual continued service whose performance is rated as either "needs improvement" or "unsatisfactory" must be evaluated at least once in the school year following the receipt of such rating.
    Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section or any other Section of the School Code, a principal shall not be prohibited from evaluating any teachers within a school during his or her first year as principal of such school. If a first-year principal exercises this option in a school district where the evaluation plan provides for a teacher in contractual continued service to be evaluated once in the course of every 2 school years, then a new 2-year evaluation plan must be established.
    The evaluation plan shall comply with the requirements of this Section and of any rules adopted by the State Board of Education pursuant to this Section.
    The plan shall include a description of each teacher's duties and responsibilities and of the standards to which that teacher is expected to conform, and shall include at least the following components:
        (a) personal observation of the teacher in the
    	
classroom by the evaluator, unless the teacher has no classroom duties.
        (b) consideration of the teacher's attendance,
    	
planning, instructional methods, classroom management, where relevant, and competency in the subject matter taught.
        (c) by no later than the applicable implementation
    	
date, consideration of student growth as a significant factor in the rating of the teacher's performance.
        (d) prior to September 1, 2012, rating of the
    	
performance of teachers in contractual continued service as either:
            (i) "excellent", "satisfactory" or
        	
"unsatisfactory"; or
            (ii) "excellent", "proficient", "needs
        	
improvement" or "unsatisfactory".
        (e) on and after September 1, 2012, rating of the
    	
performance of all teachers as "excellent", "proficient", "needs improvement" or "unsatisfactory".
        (f) specification as to the teacher's strengths and
    	
weaknesses, with supporting reasons for the comments made.
        (g) inclusion of a copy of the evaluation in the
    	
teacher's personnel file and provision of a copy to the teacher.
        (h) within 30 school days after the completion of an
    	
evaluation rating a teacher in contractual continued service as "needs improvement", development by the evaluator, in consultation with the teacher, and taking into account the teacher's on-going professional responsibilities including his or her regular teaching assignments, of a professional development plan directed to the areas that need improvement and any supports that the district will provide to address the areas identified as needing improvement.
        (i) within 30 school days after completion of an
    	
evaluation rating a teacher in contractual continued service as "unsatisfactory", development and commencement by the district of a remediation plan designed to correct deficiencies cited, provided the deficiencies are deemed remediable. In all school districts the remediation plan for unsatisfactory, tenured teachers shall provide for 90 school days of remediation within the classroom, unless an applicable collective bargaining agreement provides for a shorter duration. In all school districts evaluations issued pursuant to this Section shall be issued within 10 days after the conclusion of the respective remediation plan. However, the school board or other governing authority of the district shall not lose jurisdiction to discharge a teacher in the event the evaluation is not issued within 10 days after the conclusion of the respective remediation plan.
        (j) participation in the remediation plan by the
    	
teacher in contractual continued service rated "unsatisfactory", an evaluator and a consulting teacher selected by the evaluator of the teacher who was rated "unsatisfactory", which consulting teacher is an educational employee as defined in the Educational Labor Relations Act, has at least 5 years' teaching experience, and a reasonable familiarity with the assignment of the teacher being evaluated, and who received an "excellent" rating on his or her most recent evaluation. Where no teachers who meet these criteria are available within the district, the district shall request and the applicable regional office of education shall supply, to participate in the remediation process, an individual who meets these criteria.
        In a district having a population of less than
    	
500,000 with an exclusive bargaining agent, the bargaining agent may, if it so chooses, supply a roster of qualified teachers from whom the consulting teacher is to be selected. That roster shall, however, contain the names of at least 5 teachers, each of whom meets the criteria for consulting teacher with regard to the teacher being evaluated, or the names of all teachers so qualified if that number is less than 5. In the event of a dispute as to qualification, the State Board shall determine qualification.
        (k) a mid-point and final evaluation by an evaluator
    	
during and at the end of the remediation period, immediately following receipt of a remediation plan provided for under subsections (i) and (j) of this Section. Each evaluation shall assess the teacher's performance during the time period since the prior evaluation; provided that the last evaluation shall also include an overall evaluation of the teacher's performance during the remediation period. A written copy of the evaluations and ratings, in which any deficiencies in performance and recommendations for correction are identified, shall be provided to and discussed with the teacher within 10 school days after the date of the evaluation, unless an applicable collective bargaining agreement provides to the contrary. These subsequent evaluations shall be conducted by an evaluator. The consulting teacher shall provide advice to the teacher rated "unsatisfactory" on how to improve teaching skills and to successfully complete the remediation plan. The consulting teacher shall participate in developing the remediation plan, but the final decision as to the evaluation shall be done solely by the evaluator, unless an applicable collective bargaining agreement provides to the contrary. Evaluations at the conclusion of the remediation process shall be separate and distinct from the required annual evaluations of teachers and shall not be subject to the guidelines and procedures relating to those annual evaluations. The evaluator may but is not required to use the forms provided for the annual evaluation of teachers in the district's evaluation plan.
        (l) reinstatement to the evaluation schedule set
    	
forth in the district's evaluation plan for any teacher in contractual continued service who achieves a rating equal to or better than "satisfactory" or "proficient" in the school year following a rating of "needs improvement" or "unsatisfactory".
        (m) dismissal in accordance with subsection (d) of
    	
Section 24-12 or Section 24-16.5 or 34-85 of this Code of any teacher who fails to complete any applicable remediation plan with a rating equal to or better than a "satisfactory" or "proficient" rating. Districts and teachers subject to dismissal hearings are precluded from compelling the testimony of consulting teachers at such hearings under subsection (d) of Section 24-12 or Section 24-16.5 or 34-85 of this Code, either as to the rating process or for opinions of performances by teachers under remediation.
        (n) After the implementation date of an evaluation
    	
system for teachers in a district as specified in Section 24A-2.5 of this Code, if a teacher in contractual continued service successfully completes a remediation plan following a rating of "unsatisfactory" in an annual or biennial overall performance evaluation received after the foregoing implementation date and receives a subsequent rating of "unsatisfactory" in any of the teacher's annual or biennial overall performance evaluation ratings received during the 36-month period following the teacher's completion of the remediation plan, then the school district may forego remediation and seek dismissal in accordance with subsection (d) of Section 24-12 or Section 34-85 of this Code.
    Nothing in this Section or Section 24A-4 shall be construed as preventing immediate dismissal of a teacher for deficiencies which are deemed irremediable or for actions which are injurious to or endanger the health or person of students in the classroom or school, or preventing the dismissal or non-renewal of teachers not in contractual continued service for any reason not prohibited by applicable employment, labor, and civil rights laws. Failure to strictly comply with the time requirements contained in Section 24A-5 shall not invalidate the results of the remediation plan.
    Nothing contained in this amendatory Act of the 98th General Assembly repeals, supersedes, invalidates, or nullifies final decisions in lawsuits pending on the effective date of this amendatory Act of the 98th General Assembly in Illinois courts involving the interpretation of Public Act 97-8.
    If the Governor has declared a disaster due to a public health emergency pursuant to Section 7 of the Illinois Emergency Management Agency Act that suspends in-person instruction, the timelines in this Section connected to the commencement and completion of any remediation plan are waived. Except if the parties mutually agree otherwise and the agreement is in writing, any remediation plan that had been in place for more than 45 days prior to the suspension of in-person instruction shall resume when in-person instruction resumes and any remediation plan that had been in place for fewer than 45 days prior to the suspension of in-person instruction shall be discontinued and a new remediation period shall begin when in-person instruction resumes. The requirements of this paragraph apply regardless of whether they are included in a school district's teacher evaluation plan.

    Sec. 24A-5.5. Local appeal process for unsatisfactory ratings. Beginning with the first school year following the effective date of this amendatory Act of the 101st General Assembly, each school district shall, in good faith cooperation with its teachers or, if applicable, through good faith bargaining with the exclusive bargaining representative of its teachers, develop and implement an appeals process for "unsatisfactory" ratings under Section 24A-5 that includes, but is not limited to, an assessment of the original rating by a panel of qualified evaluators agreed to by the joint committee referred to in subsection (b) of Section 24A-4 that has the power to revoke the "unsatisfactory" rating it deems to be erroneous. The joint committee shall determine the criteria for successful appeals; however, the issuance of a rating to replace an "unsatisfactory" rating must be determined through bargaining between the exclusive bargaining representative, if any, and the school district.

    Sec. 24A-7. Rules. The State Board of Education is authorized to adopt such rules as are deemed necessary to implement and accomplish the purposes and provisions of this Article, including, but not limited to, rules (i) relating to the methods for measuring student growth (including, but not limited to, limitations on the age of useable data; the amount of data needed to reliably and validly measure growth for the purpose of teacher and principal evaluations; and whether and at what time annual State assessments may be used as one of multiple measures of student growth), (ii) defining the term "significant factor" for purposes of including consideration of student growth in performance ratings, (iii) controlling for such factors as student characteristics (including, but not limited to, students receiving special education and English Language Learner services), student attendance, and student mobility so as to best measure the impact that a teacher, principal, school and school district has on students' academic achievement, (iv) establishing minimum requirements for district teacher and principal evaluation instruments and procedures, and (v) establishing a model evaluation plan for use by school districts in which student growth shall comprise 50% of the performance rating. Notwithstanding any provision in this Section, such rules shall not preclude a school district having 500,000 or more inhabitants from using an annual State assessment as the sole measure of student growth for purposes of teacher or principal evaluations.
    The State Superintendent of Education shall convene a Performance Evaluation Advisory Council, which shall be staffed by the State Board of Education. Members of the Council shall be selected by the State Superintendent and include, without limitation, representatives of teacher unions and school district management, persons with expertise in performance evaluation processes and systems, as well as other stakeholders. The Council shall meet at least quarterly, and may also meet at the call of the chairperson of the Council, following the effective date of this amendatory Act of the 100th General Assembly until June 30, 2021. The Council shall advise the State Board of Education on the ongoing implementation of performance evaluations in this State, which may include gathering public feedback, sharing best practices, consulting with the State Board on any proposed rule changes regarding evaluations, and other subjects as determined by the chairperson of the Council.
    Prior to the applicable implementation date, these rules shall not apply to teachers assigned to schools identified in an agreement entered into between the board of a school district operating under Article 34 of this Code and the exclusive representative of the district's teachers in accordance with Section 34-85c of this Code.

    (a) Each school district, except for a school district organized under Article 34 of this Code, shall establish a principal and assistant principal evaluation plan in accordance with this Section. The plan must ensure that each principal and assistant principal is evaluated as follows:
        (1) For a principal or assistant principal on a
    	
single-year contract, the evaluation must take place by March 1 of each year.
        (2) For a principal or assistant principal on a
    	
multi-year contract under Section 10-23.8a of this Code, the evaluation must take place by March 1 of the final year of the contract.
    On and after September 1, 2012, the plan must:
        (i) rate the principal's or assistant principal's
    	
performance as "excellent", "proficient", "needs improvement" or "unsatisfactory"; and
        (ii) ensure that each principal and assistant
    	
principal is evaluated at least once every school year.
    Nothing in this Section prohibits a school district from conducting additional evaluations of principals and assistant principals.
    (b) The evaluation shall include a description of the principal's or assistant principal's duties and responsibilities and the standards to which the principal or assistant principal is expected to conform.
    (c) The evaluation for a principal must be performed by the district superintendent, the superintendent's designee, or, in the absence of the superintendent or his or her designee, an individual appointed by the school board who holds a registered Type 75 State administrative certificate.
    Prior to September 1, 2012, the evaluation must be in writing and must at least do all of the following:
        (1) Consider the principal's specific duties,
    	
responsibilities, management, and competence as a principal.
        (2) Specify the principal's strengths and weaknesses,
    	
with supporting reasons.
        (3) Align with research-based standards established
    	
by administrative rule.
    On and after September 1, 2012, the evaluation must, in addition to the requirements in items (1), (2), and (3) of this subsection (c), provide for the use of data and indicators on student growth as a significant factor in rating performance.
    (c-5) The evaluation of an assistant principal must be performed by the principal, the district superintendent, the superintendent's designee, or, in the absence of the superintendent or his or her designee, an individual appointed by the school board who holds a registered Type 75 State administrative certificate. The evaluation must be in writing and must at least do all of the following:
        (1) Consider the assistant principal's specific
    	
duties, responsibilities, management, and competence as an assistant principal.
        (2) Specify the assistant principal's strengths and
    	
weaknesses with supporting reasons.
        (3) Align with the Illinois Professional Standards
    	
for School Leaders or research-based district standards.
    On and after September 1, 2012, the evaluation must, in addition to the requirements in items (1), (2), and (3) of this subsection (c-5), provide for the use of data and indicators on student growth as a significant factor in rating performance.
    (d) One copy of the evaluation must be included in the principal's or assistant principal's personnel file and one copy of the evaluation must be provided to the principal or assistant principal.
    (e) Failure by a district to evaluate a principal or assistant principal and to provide the principal or assistant principal with a copy of the evaluation at least once during the term of the principal's or assistant principal's contract, in accordance with this Section, is evidence that the principal or assistant principal is performing duties and responsibilities in at least a satisfactory manner and shall serve to automatically extend the principal's or assistant principal's contract for a period of one year after the contract would otherwise expire, under the same terms and conditions as the prior year's contract. The requirements in this Section are in addition to the right of a school board to reclassify a principal or assistant principal pursuant to Section 10-23.8b of this Code.
    (f) Nothing in this Section prohibits a school board from ordering lateral transfers of principals or assistant principals to positions of similar rank and salary.

    (a) On or before the date established in subsection (b) of this Section, the State Board of Education shall, through a process involving collaboration with the Performance Evaluation Advisory Council, develop or contract for the development of and implement all of the following data collection and evaluation assessment and support systems:
        (1) A system to annually collect and publish data by
    	
district and school on teacher and administrator performance evaluation outcomes. The system must ensure that no teacher or administrator can be personally identified by publicly reported data.
        (2) Both a teacher and principal model evaluation
    	
template. The model templates must incorporate the requirements of this Article and any other requirements established by the State Board by administrative rule, but allow customization by districts in a manner that does not conflict with such requirements.
        (3) An evaluator pre-qualification program based on
    	
the model teacher evaluation template.
        (4) An evaluator training program based on the model
    	
teacher evaluation template. The training program shall provide multiple training options that account for the prior training and experience of the evaluator.
        (5) A superintendent training program based on the
    	
model principal evaluation template.
        (6) One or more instruments to provide feedback to
    	
principals on the instructional environment within a school.
        (7) A State Board-provided or approved technical

implementation of the model templates and the evaluator pre-qualification and training programs.
        (9) A process for measuring and reporting
    	
correlations between local principal and teacher evaluations and (A) student growth in tested grades and subjects and (B) retention rates of teachers.
        (10) A process for assessing whether school district
    	
evaluation systems developed pursuant to this Act and that consider student growth as a significant factor in the rating of a teacher's and principal's performance are valid and reliable, contribute to the development of staff, and improve student achievement outcomes. By no later than September 1, 2014, a research-based study shall be issued assessing such systems for validity and reliability, contribution to the development of staff, and improvement of student performance and recommending, based on the results of this study, changes, if any, that need to be incorporated into teacher and principal evaluation systems that consider student growth as a significant factor in the rating performance for remaining school districts to be required to implement such systems.
    (b) If the State of Illinois receives a Race to the Top Grant, the data collection and support systems described in subsection (a) must be developed on or before September 30, 2011. If the State of Illinois does not receive a Race to the Top Grant, the data collection and support systems described in subsection (a) must be developed on or before September 30, 2012; provided, however, that the data collection and support systems set forth in items (3) and (4) of subsection (a) of this Section must be developed by September 30, 2011 regardless of whether the State of Illinois receives a Race to the Top Grant. By no later than September 1, 2011, if the State of Illinois receives a Race to the Top Grant, or September 1, 2012, if the State of Illinois does not receive a Race to the Top Grant, the State Board of Education must execute or contract for the execution of the assessment referenced in item (10) of subsection (a) of this Section to determine whether the school district evaluation systems developed pursuant to this Act have been valid and reliable, contributed to the development of staff, and improved student performance.
    (c) Districts shall submit data and information to the State Board on teacher and principal performance evaluations and evaluation plans in accordance with procedures and requirements for submissions established by the State Board. Such data shall include, without limitation, (i) data on the performance rating given to all teachers in contractual continued service, (ii) data on district recommendations to renew or not renew teachers not in contractual continued service, and (iii) data on the performance rating given to all principals.
    (d) If the State Board of Education does not timely fulfill any of the requirements set forth in Sections 24A-7 and 24A-20, and adequate and sustainable federal, State, or other funds are not provided to the State Board of Education and school districts to meet their responsibilities under this Article, the applicable implementation date shall be postponed by the number of calendar days equal to those needed by the State Board of Education to fulfill such requirements and for the adequate and sustainable funds to be provided to the State Board of Education and school districts. The determination as to whether the State Board of Education has fulfilled any or all requirements set forth in Sections 24A-7 and 24A-20 and whether adequate and sustainable funds have been provided to the State Board of Education and school districts shall be made by the State Board of Education in consultation with the P-20 Council.

ARTICLE 26. PUPILS--COMPULSORY ATTENDANCE

    (105 ILCS 5/26-1) (from Ch. 122, par. 26-1)
    Sec. 26-1. Compulsory school age; exemptions. Whoever has custody or control of any child (i) between the ages of 7 and 17 years (unless the child has already graduated from high school) for school years before the 2014-2015 school year or (ii) between the ages of 6 (on or before September 1) and 17 years (unless the child has already graduated from high school) beginning with the 2014-2015 school year shall cause such child to attend some public school in the district wherein the child resides the entire time it is in session during the regular school term, except as provided in Section 10-19.1, and during a required summer school program established under Section 10-22.33B; provided, that the following children shall not be required to attend the public schools:
        1. Any child attending a private or a parochial
    	
school where children are taught the branches of education taught to children of corresponding age and grade in the public schools, and where the instruction of the child in the branches of education is in the English language;
        2. Any child who is physically or mentally unable to
    	
attend school, such disability being certified to the county or district truant officer by a competent physician licensed in Illinois to practice medicine and surgery in all its branches, a chiropractic physician licensed under the Medical Practice Act of 1987, a licensed advanced practice registered nurse, a licensed physician assistant, or a Christian Science practitioner residing in this State and listed in the Christian Science Journal; or who is excused for temporary absence for cause by the principal or teacher of the school which the child attends; the exemptions in this paragraph (2) do not apply to any female who is pregnant or the mother of one or more children, except where a female is unable to attend school due to a complication arising from her pregnancy and the existence of such complication is certified to the county or district truant officer by a competent physician;
        3. Any child necessarily and lawfully employed
    	
according to the provisions of the law regulating child labor may be excused from attendance at school by the county superintendent of schools or the superintendent of the public school which the child should be attending, on certification of the facts by and the recommendation of the school board of the public school district in which the child resides. In districts having part-time continuation schools, children so excused shall attend such schools at least 8 hours each week;
        4. Any child over 12 and under 14 years of age while
    	
in attendance at confirmation classes;
        5. Any child absent from a public school on a

Each school board shall prescribe rules and regulations relative to absences for religious holidays including, but not limited to, a list of religious holidays on which it shall be mandatory to excuse a child; but nothing in this paragraph 5 shall be construed to limit the right of any school board, at its discretion, to excuse an absence on any other day by reason of the observance of a religious holiday. A school board may require the parent or guardian of a child who is to be excused from attending school due to the observance of a religious holiday to give notice, not exceeding 5 days, of the child's absence to the school principal or other school personnel. Any child excused from attending school under this paragraph 5 shall not be required to submit a written excuse for such absence after returning to school;

a public school on a particular day or days or at a particular time of day for the purpose of sounding "Taps" at a military honors funeral held in this State for a deceased veteran. In order to be excused under this paragraph 7, the student shall notify the school's administration at least 2 days prior to the date of the absence and shall provide the school's administration with the date, time, and location of the military honors funeral. The school's administration may waive this 2-day notification requirement if the student did not receive at least 2 days advance notice, but the student shall notify the school's administration as soon as possible of the absence. A student whose absence is excused under this paragraph 7 shall be counted as if the student attended school for purposes of calculating the average daily attendance of students in the school district. A student whose absence is excused under this paragraph 7 must be allowed a reasonable time to make up school work missed during the absence. If the student satisfactorily completes the school work, the day of absence shall be counted as a day of compulsory attendance and he or she may not be penalized for that absence; and
        8. Any child absent from a public school on a
    	
particular day or days or at a particular time of day for the reason that his or her parent or legal guardian is an active duty member of the uniformed services and has been called to duty for, is on leave from, or has immediately returned from deployment to a combat zone or combat-support postings. Such a student shall be granted 5 days of excused absences in any school year and, at the discretion of the school board, additional excused absences to visit the student's parent or legal guardian relative to such leave or deployment of the parent or legal guardian. In the case of excused absences pursuant to this paragraph 8, the student and parent or legal guardian shall be responsible for obtaining assignments from the student's teacher prior to any period of excused absence and for ensuring that such assignments are completed by the student prior to his or her return to school from such period of excused absence.

No child shall be denied reenrollment for the above reasons unless the school district first offers the child due process as required in cases of expulsion under Section 10-22.6. If a child is denied reenrollment after being provided with due process, the school district must provide counseling to that child and must direct that child to alternative educational programs, including adult education programs, that lead to graduation or receipt of a high school equivalency certificate.
    (c) A school or school district may deny enrollment to a student 17 years of age or older for one semester for failure to meet minimum attendance standards if all of the following conditions are met:

20% or more of the attendance days in the semester immediately prior to the current semester.
        (2) The student and the student's parent or guardian
    	
are given written notice warning that the student is subject to denial from enrollment for one semester unless the student is absent without valid cause less than 20% of the attendance days in the current semester.
        (3) The student's parent or guardian is provided with
    	
the right to appeal the notice, as determined by the State Board of Education in accordance with due process.
        (4) The student is provided with attendance
    	
remediation services, including without limitation assessment, counseling, and support services.
        (5) The student is absent without valid cause for 20%
    	
or more of the attendance days in the current semester.
    A school or school district may not deny enrollment to a student (or reenrollment to a dropout) who is at least 17 years of age or older but below 19 years for more than one consecutive semester for failure to meet attendance standards.
    (d) No child may be denied reenrollment under this Section in violation of the federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act or the Americans with Disabilities Act.

Each school district shall identify, track, and report on the educational progress and outcomes of reenrolled students as a subset of the district's required reporting on all enrollments. A reenrolled student who again drops out must not be counted again against a district's dropout rate performance measure. The State Board of Education shall set performance standards for programs serving reenrolled students.

The report shall also contain the names of any other persons who were not enumerated in the list at the beginning of school and who have the custody or control of children not attending school. The regional superintendent shall, without delay, place such information at the disposal of the regional truant officer.

    The clerk or secretary of the school board of all school districts shall furnish quarterly on the first school day of October, January, April and July to the regional superintendent and to the Secretary of State a list of pupils, excluding transferees, who have been expelled or have withdrawn or who have left school and have been removed from the regular attendance rolls during the period of time school was in regular session from the time of the previous quarterly report. Such list shall include the names and addresses of pupils formerly in attendance, the names and addresses of persons having custody or control of such pupils, the reason, if known, such pupils are no longer in attendance and the date of removal from the attendance rolls. The list shall also include the names of: pupils whose withdrawal is due to extraordinary circumstances, including but not limited to economic or medical necessity or family hardship, as determined by the criteria established by the school district; pupils who have re-enrolled in school since their names were removed from the attendance rolls; any pupil certified to be a chronic or habitual truant, as defined in Section 26-2a; and pupils previously certified as chronic or habitual truants who have resumed regular school attendance. The regional superintendent shall inform the county or district truant officer who shall investigate to see that such pupils are in compliance with the requirements of this Article.
    Each local school district shall establish, in writing, a set of criteria for use by the local superintendent of schools in determining whether a pupil's failure to attend school is the result of extraordinary circumstances, including but not limited to economic or medical necessity or family hardship.
    If a pupil re-enrolls in school after his or her name was removed from the attendance rolls or resumes regular attendance after being certified a chronic or habitual truant, the pupil must obtain and forward to the Secretary of State, on a form designated by the Secretary of State, verification of his or her re-enrollment. The verification may be in the form of a signature or seal or in any other form determined by the school board.
    The State Board of Education shall, if possible, make available to any person, upon request, a comparison of drop out rates before and after the effective date of this amendatory Act of the 94th General Assembly.

    Sec. 26-3b. Beginning July 1, 1986, if any child enrolled in a public school in grades Kindergarten through 8 is absent from school, and there is no record that such absence is for a valid cause, as defined under Article 26 of this Code, nor notification that the absence has been authorized by the parent, legal guardian or other person having legal custody of such child, an employee or other agent, whether a volunteer or otherwise, designated by the public school in which the child is enrolled shall, within 2 hours after the first class in which the child is enrolled, make a reasonable effort to promptly telephone and notify the parent, legal guardian, or other person having legal custody of the child, of the child's absence from school. Such notification shall not be given for an absence authorized by the parent, legal guardian or other person having legal custody of such child. Prior to any enrollment of a child in a public school, the school district shall notify parents, legal guardians, or other persons having legal custody of a child, of their responsibility to authorize any absence and to notify the school in advance or at the time of any such absence, and that the school requires at least one and not more than 2 telephone numbers be given for purposes of this Section. The school district shall require that such telephone numbers be given at the time of enrollment of the child in school, which said numbers may be changed from time to time upon notification to the school.
    The requirements of this Section shall have been met by the school if notification of an absence has been attempted by telephoning the 1 or 2 numbers given the school by the parent, legal guardian or other person having legal custody of a child, whether or not there is any answer at such telephone number or numbers. Further, the requirements of this Section shall have been met if the said notification is given to a member of the household of the child's parent, legal guardian or other person having legal custody of the child, which said member of the household must be 10 years of age or older.
    An employee or other agent designated by the public school who in good faith makes a reasonable effort to notify the parent, legal guardian or other person having legal custody of a child of the child's absence from school, when required by this Section, shall not, as a result of his acts or omissions, except wilful or wanton misconduct on the part of such employee or agent in attempting to comply with the notification requirements of this Section, be liable for civil damages.

If 3 notices have been given and the notices have not been complied with, and if the persons having custody or control have knowingly and wilfully permitted the truant behavior to continue, the regional superintendent of schools, or his or her designee, of the school district where the child resides shall conduct a truancy hearing. If the regional superintendent determines as a result of the hearing that the child is truant, the regional superintendent shall, if age appropriate at the discretion of the regional superintendent, require the student to complete 20 to 40 hours of community service over a period of 90 days. If the truancy persists, the regional superintendent shall (i) make complaint against the persons having custody or control to the state's attorney or in the circuit court in the county where such person resides for failure to comply with the provisions of this Article or (ii) conduct truancy mediation and encourage the student to enroll in a graduation incentives program under Section 26-16 of this Code.

    Sec. 26-12. Punitive action.
    (a) No punitive action, including out-of-school suspensions, expulsions, or court action, shall be taken against truant minors for such truancy unless appropriate and available supportive services and other school resources have been provided to the student. Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 10-22.6 of this Code, a truant minor may not be expelled for nonattendance unless he or she has accrued 15 consecutive days of absences without valid cause and the student cannot be located by the school district or the school district has located the student but cannot, after exhausting all available supportive services, compel the student to return to school.
    (b) A school district may not refer a truant, chronic truant, or truant minor to any other local public entity, as defined under Section 1-206 of the Local Governmental and Governmental Employees Tort Immunity Act, for that local public entity to issue the child a fine or a fee as punishment for his or her truancy.
    (c) A school district may refer any person having custody or control of a truant, chronic truant, or truant minor to any other local public entity, as defined under Section 1-206 of the Local Governmental and Governmental Employees Tort Immunity Act, for that local public entity to issue the person a fine or fee for the child's truancy only if the school district's truant officer, regional office of education, or intermediate service center has been notified of the truant behavior and the school district, regional office of education, or intermediate service center has offered all appropriate and available supportive services and other school resources to the child. Before a school district may refer a person having custody or control of a child to a municipality, as defined under Section 1-1-2 of the Illinois Municipal Code, the school district must provide the following appropriate and available services:
        (1) For any child who is a homeless child, as defined
    	
under Section 1-5 of the Education for Homeless Children Act, a meeting between the child, the person having custody or control of the child, relevant school personnel, and a homeless liaison to discuss any barriers to the child's attendance due to the child's transitional living situation and to construct a plan that removes these barriers.
        (2) For any child with a documented disability, a
    	
meeting between the child, the person having custody or control of the child, and relevant school personnel to review the child's current needs and address the appropriateness of the child's placement and services. For any child subject to Article 14 of this Code, this meeting shall be an individualized education program meeting and shall include relevant members of the individualized education program team. For any child with a disability under Section 504 of the federal Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794), this meeting shall be a Section 504 plan review and include relevant members of the Section 504 plan team.
        (3) For any child currently being evaluated by a
    	
school district for a disability or for whom the school has a basis of knowledge that the child is a child with a disability under 20 U.S.C. 1415(k)(5), the completion of the evaluation and determination of the child's eligibility for special education services.
    (d) Before a school district may refer a person having custody or control of a child to a local public entity under this Section, the school district must document any appropriate and available supportive services offered to the child. In the event a meeting under this Section does not occur, a school district must have documentation that it made reasonable efforts to convene the meeting at a mutually convenient time and date for the school district and the person having custody or control of the child and, but for the conduct of that person, the meeting would have occurred.

    (a) The General Assembly finds that it is critical to provide options for children to succeed in school. The purpose of this Section is to provide incentives for and encourage all Illinois students who have experienced or are experiencing difficulty in the traditional education system to enroll in alternative programs.
    (b) Any student who is below the age of 20 years is eligible to enroll in a graduation incentives program if he or she:
        (1) is considered a dropout pursuant to Section
    	
26-2a of this Code;
        (2) has been suspended or expelled pursuant to
    	
Section 10-22.6 or 34-19 of this Code;
        (3) is pregnant or is a parent;
        (4) has been assessed as chemically dependent; or
        (5) is enrolled in a bilingual education or LEP
    	
program.
    (c) The following programs qualify as graduation incentives programs for students meeting the criteria established in this Section:
        (1) Any public elementary or secondary education
    	
graduation incentives program established by a school district or by a regional office of education.
        (2) Any alternative learning opportunities program
    	
established pursuant to Article 13B of this Code.
        (3) Vocational or job training courses approved by
    	
the State Superintendent of Education that are available through the Illinois public community college system. Students may apply for reimbursement of 50% of tuition costs for one course per semester or a maximum of 3 courses per school year. Subject to available funds, students may apply for reimbursement of up to 100% of tuition costs upon a showing of employment within 6 months after completion of a vocational or job training program. The qualifications for reimbursement shall be established by the State Superintendent of Education by rule.
        (4) Job and career programs approved by the State
    	
Superintendent of Education that are available through Illinois-accredited private business and vocational schools. Subject to available funds, pupils may apply for reimbursement of up to 100% of tuition costs upon a showing of employment within 6 months after completion of a job or career program. The State Superintendent of Education shall establish, by rule, the qualifications for reimbursement, criteria for determining reimbursement amounts, and limits on reimbursement.
        (5) Adult education courses that offer preparation
    	
for high school equivalency testing.
    (d) Graduation incentives programs established by school districts are entitled to claim general State aid and evidence-based funding, subject to Sections 13B-50, 13B-50.5, and 13B-50.10 of this Code. Graduation incentives programs operated by regional offices of education are entitled to receive general State aid and evidence-based funding at the foundation level of support per pupil enrolled. A school district must ensure that its graduation incentives program receives supplemental general State aid, transportation reimbursements, and special education resources, if appropriate, for students enrolled in the program.

    Sec. 26-18. Chronic absenteeism report and support.
    (a) As used in this Section:
    "Chronic absence" means absences that total 10% or more of school days of the most recent academic school year, including absences with and without valid cause, as defined in Section 26-2a of this Code, and out-of-school suspensions for an enrolled student.
    "Student" means any enrolled student that is subject to compulsory attendance under Section 26-1 of this Code but does not mean a student for whom a documented homebound or hospital record is on file during the student's absence from school.
    (b) The General Assembly finds that:
        (1) The early years are a critical period in
    	
children's learning and development. Every child should be counted present every day. Every day of school matters.
        (2) Being absent too many days from school can make
    	
it difficult for students to stay on-track academically and maintain the momentum to graduate from high school in order to be college- or career-ready.
        (3) Every day of school attendance matters for all
    	
students and their families. It is crucial, therefore, that the implications of chronic absence be understood and reviewed regularly.
    (c) Beginning July 1, 2018, every school district, charter school, or alternative school or any school receiving public funds shall collect and review its chronic absence data and determine what systems of support and resources are needed to engage chronically absent students and their families to encourage the habit of daily attendance and promote success. The review shall include an analysis of chronic absence data from each attendance center or campus of the school district, charter school, or alternative school or other school receiving public funds.
    (d) School districts, charter schools, or alternative schools or any school receiving public funds are encouraged to provide a system of support to students who are at risk of reaching or exceeding chronic absence levels with strategies such as those available through the Illinois Multi-tiered Systems of Support Network. Schools additionally are encouraged to make resources available to families such as those available through the State Board of Education's Family Engagement Framework to support and engage students and their families to encourage heightened school engagement and improved daily school attendance.

    Sec. 26-19. Chronic absenteeism in preschool children.
    (a) In this Section, "chronic absence" has the meaning ascribed to that term in Section 26-18 of this Code.
    (b) The General Assembly makes all of the following findings:
        (1) The early years are an extremely important period
    	
in a child's learning and development.
        (2) Missed learning opportunities in the early years
    	
make it difficult for a child to enter kindergarten ready for success.
        (3) Attendance patterns in the early years serve as
    	
predictors of chronic absenteeism and reduced educational outcomes in later school years. Therefore, it is crucial that the implications of chronic absence be understood and reviewed regularly in all publicly funded early childhood programs receiving State funds under Section 2-3.71 of this Code.
    (c) Beginning July 1, 2019, any publicly funded early childhood program receiving State funds under Section 2-3.71 of this Code shall collect and review its chronic absence data and determine what support and resources are needed to positively engage chronically absent students and their families to encourage the habit of daily attendance and promote success.
    (d) Publicly funded early childhood programs receiving State funds under Section 2-3.71 of this Code are encouraged to do all of the following:
        (1) Provide support to students who are at risk of
    	
reaching or exceeding chronic absence levels.
        (2) Make resources available to families, such as
    	
those available through the State Board of Education's Family Engagement Framework, to support and encourage families to ensure their children's daily program attendance.
        (3) Include information about chronic absenteeism as
    	
part of their preschool to kindergarten transition resources.
    (e) On or before July 1, 2020, and annually thereafter, an early childhood program shall report all data collected under subsection (c) of this Section to the State Board of Education, which shall make the report publicly available via the Illinois Early Childhood Asset Map Internet website and the Preschool for All Program or Preschool for All Expansion Program triennial report.

    Sec. 27-1. Areas of education taught - discrimination on account of sex. The State of Illinois, having the responsibility of defining requirements for elementary and secondary education, establishes that the primary purpose of schooling is the transmission of knowledge and culture through which children learn in areas necessary to their continuing development and entry into the world of work. Such areas include the language arts, mathematics, the biological, physical and social sciences, the fine arts and physical development and health.
    Each school district shall give priority in the allocation of resources, including funds, time allocation, personnel, and facilities, to fulfilling the primary purpose of schooling.
    The State Board of Education shall establish goals and learning standards consistent with the above purposes and define the knowledge and skills which the State expects students to master and apply as a consequence of their education.
    Each school district shall establish learning objectives consistent with the State Board of Education's goals and learning standards for the areas referred to in this Section, shall develop appropriate testing and assessment systems for determining the degree to which students are achieving the objectives, and shall develop reporting systems to apprise the community and State of the assessment results.
    Each school district shall make available to all students academic and vocational courses for the attainment of learning objectives.
    No student shall be refused admission into or be excluded from any course of instruction offered in the common schools by reason of that person's sex. No student shall, solely by reason of that person's sex, be denied equal access to physical education and interscholastic athletic programs or comparable programs supported from school district funds. This Section is violated when a high school subject to this Act participates in the post-season basketball tournament of any organization or association that does not conduct post-season high school basketball tournaments for both boys and girls, which tournaments are identically structured. Conducting identically structured tournaments includes having the same number of girls' teams as boys' teams playing, in their respective tournaments, at any common location chosen for the final series of games in a tournament; provided, that nothing in this paragraph shall be deemed to prohibit the selection for the final series of games in the girls' tournaments of a common location that is different than the common location selected for the final series of games in the boys' tournaments. Except as specifically stated in this Section, equal access to programs supported by school district funds and comparable programs will be defined in rules promulgated by the State Board of Education in consultation with the Illinois High School Association.

    Sec. 27-6. Courses in physical education required; special activities.
    (a) Pupils enrolled in the public schools and State universities engaged in preparing teachers shall be required to engage during the school day, except on block scheduled days for those public schools engaged in block scheduling, in courses of physical education for such periods as are compatible with the optimum growth and developmental needs of individuals at the various age levels except when appropriate excuses are submitted to the school by a pupil's parent or guardian or by a person licensed under the Medical Practice Act of 1987 and except as provided in subsection (b) of this Section. A school board may determine the schedule or frequency of physical education courses, provided that a pupil engages in a course of physical education for a minimum of 3 days per 5-day week.
    Special activities in physical education shall be provided for pupils whose physical or emotional condition, as determined by a person licensed under the Medical Practice Act of 1987, prevents their participation in the courses provided for normal children.
    (b) A school board is authorized to excuse pupils enrolled in grades 11 and 12 from engaging in physical education courses if those pupils request to be excused for any of the following reasons: (1) for ongoing participation in an interscholastic athletic program; (2) to enroll in academic classes which are required for admission to an institution of higher learning, provided that failure to take such classes will result in the pupil being denied admission to the institution of his or her choice; or (3) to enroll in academic classes which are required for graduation from high school, provided that failure to take such classes will result in the pupil being unable to graduate. A school board may also excuse pupils in grades 9 through 12 enrolled in a marching band program for credit from engaging in physical education courses if those pupils request to be excused for ongoing participation in such marching band program. A school board may also, on a case-by-case basis, excuse pupils in grades 7 through 12 who participate in an interscholastic or extracurricular athletic program from engaging in physical education courses. In addition, a pupil in any of grades 3 through 12 who is eligible for special education may be excused if the pupil's parent or guardian agrees that the pupil must utilize the time set aside for physical education to receive special education support and services or, if there is no agreement, the individualized education program team for the pupil determines that the pupil must utilize the time set aside for physical education to receive special education support and services, which agreement or determination must be made a part of the individualized education program. However, a pupil requiring adapted physical education must receive that service in accordance with the individualized education program developed for the pupil. If requested, a school board is authorized to excuse a pupil from engaging in a physical education course if the pupil has an individualized educational program under Article 14 of this Code, is participating in an adaptive athletic program outside of the school setting, and documents such participation as determined by the school board. A school board may also excuse pupils in grades 9 through 12 enrolled in a Reserve Officer's Training Corps (ROTC) program sponsored by the school district from engaging in physical education courses. School boards which choose to exercise this authority shall establish a policy to excuse pupils on an individual basis.
    (c) The provisions of this Section are subject to the provisions of Section 27-22.05.

    Sec. 27-6.5. Physical fitness assessments in schools.
    (a) As used in this Section, "physical fitness assessment" means a series of assessments to measure aerobic capacity, body composition, muscular strength, muscular endurance, and flexibility.
    (b) To measure the effectiveness of State Goal 20 of the Illinois Learning Standards for Physical Development and Health, beginning with the 2016-2017 school year and every school year thereafter, the State Board of Education shall require all public schools to use a scientifically-based, health-related physical fitness assessment for grades 3 through 12 and periodically report fitness information to the State Board of Education, as set forth in subsections (c) and (e) of this Section, to assess student fitness indicators.
    Public schools shall integrate health-related fitness testing into the curriculum as an instructional tool, except in grades before the 3rd grade. Fitness tests must be appropriate to students' developmental levels and physical abilities. The testing must be used to teach students how to assess their fitness levels, set goals for improvement, and monitor progress in reaching their goals. Fitness scores shall not be used for grading students or evaluating teachers.
    (c) On or before October 1, 2014, the State Superintendent of Education shall appoint a 15-member stakeholder and expert task force, including members representing organizations that represent physical education teachers, school officials, principals, health promotion and disease prevention advocates and experts, school health advocates and experts, and other experts with operational and academic expertise in the measurement of fitness. The task force shall make recommendations to the State Board of Education on the following:
        (1) methods for ensuring the validity and uniformity
    	
of reported physical fitness assessment scores, including assessment administration protocols and professional development approaches for physical education teachers;
        (2) how often physical fitness assessment scores
    	
should be reported to the State Board of Education;
        (3) the grade levels within elementary, middle, and
    	
high school categories for which physical fitness assessment scores should be reported to the State Board of Education;
        (4) the minimum fitness indicators that should be
    	
reported to the State Board of Education, including, but not limited to, a score for aerobic capacity (for grades 4 through 12); muscular strength; endurance; and flexibility;
        (5) the demographic information that should accompany
    	
the scores, including, but not limited to, grade and gender;
        (6) the development of protocols regarding the
    	
protection of students' confidentiality and individual information and identifiers; and
        (7) how physical fitness assessment data should be
    	
reported by the State Board of Education to the public, including potential correlations with student academic achievement, attendance, and discipline data and other recommended uses of the reported data.
    The State Board of Education shall provide administrative and other support to the task force.
    The task force shall submit its recommendations on physical fitness assessments on or before April 1, 2015. The task force may also recommend methods for assessing student progress on State Goals 19 and 21 through 24 of the Illinois Learning Standards for Physical Development and Health. The task force is dissolved on April 30, 2015.
    The provisions of this subsection (c), other than this sentence, are inoperative after March 31, 2016.
    (d) On or before December 31, 2015, the State Board of Education shall use the recommendations of the task force under subsection (c) of this Section to adopt rules for the implementation of physical fitness assessments by each public school for the 2016-2017 school year and every school year thereafter. The requirements of this Section do not apply if the Governor has declared a disaster due to a public health emergency pursuant to Section 7 of the Illinois Emergency Management Agency Act.
    (e) On or before September 1, 2016, the State Board of Education shall adopt rules for data submission by school districts and develop a system for collecting and reporting the aggregated fitness information from the physical fitness assessments. This system shall also support the collection of data from school districts that use a fitness testing software program.
    (f) School districts may report the aggregate findings of physical fitness assessments by grade level and school to parents and members of the community through typical communication channels, such as Internet websites, school newsletters, school board reports, and presentations. Districts may also provide individual fitness assessment reports to students' parents.
    (g) Nothing in this Section precludes schools from implementing a physical fitness assessment before the 2016-2017 school year or from implementing more robust forms of a physical fitness assessment.

    (105 ILCS 5/27-8.1) (from Ch. 122, par. 27-8.1)
    Sec. 27-8.1. Health examinations and immunizations.
    (1) In compliance with rules and regulations which the Department of Public Health shall promulgate, and except as hereinafter provided, all children in Illinois shall have a health examination as follows: within one year prior to entering kindergarten or the first grade of any public, private, or parochial elementary school; upon entering the sixth and ninth grades of any public, private, or parochial school; prior to entrance into any public, private, or parochial nursery school; and, irrespective of grade, immediately prior to or upon entrance into any public, private, or parochial school or nursery school, each child shall present proof of having been examined in accordance with this Section and the rules and regulations promulgated hereunder. Any child who received a health examination within one year prior to entering the fifth grade for the 2007-2008 school year is not required to receive an additional health examination in order to comply with the provisions of Public Act 95-422 when he or she attends school for the 2008-2009 school year, unless the child is attending school for the first time as provided in this paragraph.
    A tuberculosis skin test screening shall be included as a required part of each health examination included under this Section if the child resides in an area designated by the Department of Public Health as having a high incidence of tuberculosis. Additional health examinations of pupils, including eye examinations, may be required when deemed necessary by school authorities. Parents are encouraged to have their children undergo eye examinations at the same points in time required for health examinations.
    (1.5) In compliance with rules adopted by the Department of Public Health and except as otherwise provided in this Section, all children in kindergarten and the second, sixth, and ninth grades of any public, private, or parochial school shall have a dental examination. Each of these children shall present proof of having been examined by a dentist in accordance with this Section and rules adopted under this Section before May 15th of the school year. If a child in the second, sixth, or ninth grade fails to present proof by May 15th, the school may hold the child's report card until one of the following occurs: (i) the child presents proof of a completed dental examination or (ii) the child presents proof that a dental examination will take place within 60 days after May 15th. A school may not withhold a child's report card during a school year in which the Governor has declared a disaster due to a public health emergency pursuant to Section 7 of the Illinois Emergency Management Agency Act. The Department of Public Health shall establish, by rule, a waiver for children who show an undue burden or a lack of access to a dentist. Each public, private, and parochial school must give notice of this dental examination requirement to the parents and guardians of students at least 60 days before May 15th of each school year.
    (1.10) Except as otherwise provided in this Section, all children enrolling in kindergarten in a public, private, or parochial school on or after January 1, 2008 (the effective date of Public Act 95-671) and any student enrolling for the first time in a public, private, or parochial school on or after January 1, 2008 (the effective date of Public Act 95-671) shall have an eye examination. Each of these children shall present proof of having been examined by a physician licensed to practice medicine in all of its branches or a licensed optometrist within the previous year, in accordance with this Section and rules adopted under this Section, before October 15th of the school year. If the child fails to present proof by October 15th, the school may hold the child's report card until one of the following occurs: (i) the child presents proof of a completed eye examination or (ii) the child presents proof that an eye examination will take place within 60 days after October 15th. A school may not withhold a child's report card during a school year in which the Governor has declared a disaster due to a public health emergency pursuant to Section 7 of the Illinois Emergency Management Agency Act. The Department of Public Health shall establish, by rule, a waiver for children who show an undue burden or a lack of access to a physician licensed to practice medicine in all of its branches who provides eye examinations or to a licensed optometrist. Each public, private, and parochial school must give notice of this eye examination requirement to the parents and guardians of students in compliance with rules of the Department of Public Health. Nothing in this Section shall be construed to allow a school to exclude a child from attending because of a parent's or guardian's failure to obtain an eye examination for the child.
    (2) The Department of Public Health shall promulgate rules and regulations specifying the examinations and procedures that constitute a health examination, which shall include an age-appropriate developmental screening, an age-appropriate social and emotional screening, and the collection of data relating to asthma and obesity (including at a minimum, date of birth, gender, height, weight, blood pressure, and date of exam), and a dental examination and may recommend by rule that certain additional examinations be performed. The rules and regulations of the Department of Public Health shall specify that a tuberculosis skin test screening shall be included as a required part of each health examination included under this Section if the child resides in an area designated by the Department of Public Health as having a high incidence of tuberculosis. With respect to the developmental screening and the social and emotional screening, the Department of Public Health must, no later than January 1, 2019, develop rules and appropriate revisions to the Child Health Examination form in conjunction with a statewide organization representing school boards; a statewide organization representing pediatricians; statewide organizations representing individuals holding Illinois educator licenses with school support personnel endorsements, including school social workers, school psychologists, and school nurses; a statewide organization representing children's mental health experts; a statewide organization representing school principals; the Director of Healthcare and Family Services or his or her designee, the State Superintendent of Education or his or her designee; and representatives of other appropriate State agencies and, at a minimum, must recommend the use of validated screening tools appropriate to the child's age or grade, and, with regard to the social and emotional screening, require recording only whether or not the screening was completed. The rules shall take into consideration the screening recommendations of the American Academy of Pediatrics and must be consistent with the State Board of Education's social and emotional learning standards. The Department of Public Health shall specify that a diabetes screening as defined by rule shall be included as a required part of each health examination. Diabetes testing is not required.
    Physicians licensed to practice medicine in all of its branches, licensed advanced practice registered nurses, or licensed physician assistants shall be responsible for the performance of the health examinations, other than dental examinations, eye examinations, and vision and hearing screening, and shall sign all report forms required by subsection (4) of this Section that pertain to those portions of the health examination for which the physician, advanced practice registered nurse, or physician assistant is responsible. If a registered nurse performs any part of a health examination, then a physician licensed to practice medicine in all of its branches must review and sign all required report forms. Licensed dentists shall perform all dental examinations and shall sign all report forms required by subsection (4) of this Section that pertain to the dental examinations. Physicians licensed to practice medicine in all its branches or licensed optometrists shall perform all eye examinations required by this Section and shall sign all report forms required by subsection (4) of this Section that pertain to the eye examination. For purposes of this Section, an eye examination shall at a minimum include history, visual acuity, subjective refraction to best visual acuity near and far, internal and external examination, and a glaucoma evaluation, as well as any other tests or observations that in the professional judgment of the doctor are necessary. Vision and hearing screening tests, which shall not be considered examinations as that term is used in this Section, shall be conducted in accordance with rules and regulations of the Department of Public Health, and by individuals whom the Department of Public Health has certified. In these rules and regulations, the Department of Public Health shall require that individuals conducting vision screening tests give a child's parent or guardian written notification, before the vision screening is conducted, that states, "Vision screening is not a substitute for a complete eye and vision evaluation by an eye doctor. Your child is not required to undergo this vision screening if an optometrist or ophthalmologist has completed and signed a report form indicating that an examination has been administered within the previous 12 months.".
    (2.5) With respect to the developmental screening and the social and emotional screening portion of the health examination, each child may present proof of having been screened in accordance with this Section and the rules adopted under this Section before October 15th of the school year. With regard to the social and emotional screening only, the examining health care provider shall only record whether or not the screening was completed. If the child fails to present proof of the developmental screening or the social and emotional screening portions of the health examination by October 15th of the school year, qualified school support personnel may, with a parent's or guardian's consent, offer the developmental screening or the social and emotional screening to the child. Each public, private, and parochial school must give notice of the developmental screening and social and emotional screening requirements to the parents and guardians of students in compliance with the rules of the Department of Public Health. Nothing in this Section shall be construed to allow a school to exclude a child from attending because of a parent's or guardian's failure to obtain a developmental screening or a social and emotional screening for the child. Once a developmental screening or a social and emotional screening is completed and proof has been presented to the school, the school may, with a parent's or guardian's consent, make available appropriate school personnel to work with the parent or guardian, the child, and the provider who signed the screening form to obtain any appropriate evaluations and services as indicated on the form and in other information and documentation provided by the parents, guardians, or provider.
    (3) Every child shall, at or about the same time as he or she receives a health examination required by subsection (1) of this Section, present to the local school proof of having received such immunizations against preventable communicable diseases as the Department of Public Health shall require by rules and regulations promulgated pursuant to this Section and the Communicable Disease Prevention Act.
    (4) The individuals conducting the health examination, dental examination, or eye examination shall record the fact of having conducted the examination, and such additional information as required, including for a health examination data relating to asthma and obesity (including at a minimum, date of birth, gender, height, weight, blood pressure, and date of exam), on uniform forms which the Department of Public Health and the State Board of Education shall prescribe for statewide use. The examiner shall summarize on the report form any condition that he or she suspects indicates a need for special services, including for a health examination factors relating to asthma or obesity. The duty to summarize on the report form does not apply to social and emotional screenings. The confidentiality of the information and records relating to the developmental screening and the social and emotional screening shall be determined by the statutes, rules, and professional ethics governing the type of provider conducting the screening. The individuals confirming the administration of required immunizations shall record as indicated on the form that the immunizations were administered.
    (5) If a child does not submit proof of having had either the health examination or the immunization as required, then the child shall be examined or receive the immunization, as the case may be, and present proof by October 15 of the current school year, or by an earlier date of the current school year established by a school district. To establish a date before October 15 of the current school year for the health examination or immunization as required, a school district must give notice of the requirements of this Section 60 days prior to the earlier established date. If for medical reasons one or more of the required immunizations must be given after October 15 of the current school year, or after an earlier established date of the current school year, then the child shall present, by October 15, or by the earlier established date, a schedule for the administration of the immunizations and a statement of the medical reasons causing the delay, both the schedule and the statement being issued by the physician, advanced practice registered nurse, physician assistant, registered nurse, or local health department that will be responsible for administration of the remaining required immunizations. If a child does not comply by October 15, or by the earlier established date of the current school year, with the requirements of this subsection, then the local school authority shall exclude that child from school until such time as the child presents proof of having had the health examination as required and presents proof of having received those required immunizations which are medically possible to receive immediately. During a child's exclusion from school for noncompliance with this subsection, the child's parents or legal guardian shall be considered in violation of Section 26-1 and subject to any penalty imposed by Section 26-10. This subsection (5) does not apply to dental examinations, eye examinations, and the developmental screening and the social and emotional screening portions of the health examination. If the student is an out-of-state transfer student and does not have the proof required under this subsection (5) before October 15 of the current year or whatever date is set by the school district, then he or she may only attend classes (i) if he or she has proof that an appointment for the required vaccinations has been scheduled with a party authorized to submit proof of the required vaccinations. If the proof of vaccination required under this subsection (5) is not submitted within 30 days after the student is permitted to attend classes, then the student is not to be permitted to attend classes until proof of the vaccinations has been properly submitted. No school district or employee of a school district shall be held liable for any injury or illness to another person that results from admitting an out-of-state transfer student to class that has an appointment scheduled pursuant to this subsection (5).
    (6) Every school shall report to the State Board of Education by November 15, in the manner which that agency shall require, the number of children who have received the necessary immunizations and the health examination (other than a dental examination or eye examination) as required, indicating, of those who have not received the immunizations and examination as required, the number of children who are exempt from health examination and immunization requirements on religious or medical grounds as provided in subsection (8). On or before December 1 of each year, every public school district and registered nonpublic school shall make publicly available the immunization data they are required to submit to the State Board of Education by November 15. The immunization data made publicly available must be identical to the data the school district or school has reported to the State Board of Education.
    Every school shall report to the State Board of Education by June 30, in the manner that the State Board requires, the number of children who have received the required dental examination, indicating, of those who have not received the required dental examination, the number of children who are exempt from the dental examination on religious grounds as provided in subsection (8) of this Section and the number of children who have received a waiver under subsection (1.5) of this Section.
    Every school shall report to the State Board of Education by June 30, in the manner that the State Board requires, the number of children who have received the required eye examination, indicating, of those who have not received the required eye examination, the number of children who are exempt from the eye examination as provided in subsection (8) of this Section, the number of children who have received a waiver under subsection (1.10) of this Section, and the total number of children in noncompliance with the eye examination requirement.
    The reported information under this subsection (6) shall be provided to the Department of Public Health by the State Board of Education.
    (7) Upon determining that the number of pupils who are required to be in compliance with subsection (5) of this Section is below 90% of the number of pupils enrolled in the school district, 10% of each State aid payment made pursuant to Section 18-8.05 or 18-8.15 to the school district for such year may be withheld by the State Board of Education until the number of students in compliance with subsection (5) is the applicable specified percentage or higher.
    (8) Children of parents or legal guardians who object to health, dental, or eye examinations or any part thereof, to immunizations, or to vision and hearing screening tests on religious grounds shall not be required to undergo the examinations, tests, or immunizations to which they so object if such parents or legal guardians present to the appropriate local school authority a signed Certificate of Religious Exemption detailing the grounds for objection and the specific immunizations, tests, or examinations to which they object. The grounds for objection must set forth the specific religious belief that conflicts with the examination, test, immunization, or other medical intervention. The signed certificate shall also reflect the parent's or legal guardian's understanding of the school's exclusion policies in the case of a vaccine-preventable disease outbreak or exposure. The certificate must also be signed by the authorized examining health care provider responsible for the performance of the child's health examination confirming that the provider provided education to the parent or legal guardian on the benefits of immunization and the health risks to the student and to the community of the communicable diseases for which immunization is required in this State. However, the health care provider's signature on the certificate reflects only that education was provided and does not allow a health care provider grounds to determine a religious exemption. Those receiving immunizations required under this Code shall be provided with the relevant vaccine information statements that are required to be disseminated by the federal National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986, which may contain information on circumstances when a vaccine should not be administered, prior to administering a vaccine. A healthcare provider may consider including without limitation the nationally accepted recommendations from federal agencies such as the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, the information outlined in the relevant vaccine information statement, and vaccine package inserts, along with the healthcare provider's clinical judgment, to determine whether any child may be more susceptible to experiencing an adverse vaccine reaction than the general population, and, if so, the healthcare provider may exempt the child from an immunization or adopt an individualized immunization schedule. The Certificate of Religious Exemption shall be created by the Department of Public Health and shall be made available and used by parents and legal guardians by the beginning of the 2015-2016 school year. Parents or legal guardians must submit the Certificate of Religious Exemption to their local school authority prior to entering kindergarten, sixth grade, and ninth grade for each child for which they are requesting an exemption. The religious objection stated need not be directed by the tenets of an established religious organization. However, general philosophical or moral reluctance to allow physical examinations, eye examinations, immunizations, vision and hearing screenings, or dental examinations does not provide a sufficient basis for an exception to statutory requirements. The local school authority is responsible for determining if the content of the Certificate of Religious Exemption constitutes a valid religious objection. The local school authority shall inform the parent or legal guardian of exclusion procedures, in accordance with the Department's rules under Part 690 of Title 77 of the Illinois Administrative Code, at the time the objection is presented.
    If the physical condition of the child is such that any one or more of the immunizing agents should not be administered, the examining physician, advanced practice registered nurse, or physician assistant responsible for the performance of the health examination shall endorse that fact upon the health examination form.
    Exempting a child from the health, dental, or eye examination does not exempt the child from participation in the program of physical education training provided in Sections 27-5 through 27-7 of this Code.
    (8.5) The school board of a school district shall include informational materials regarding influenza and influenza vaccinations and meningococcal disease and meningococcal vaccinations developed, provided, or approved by the Department of Public Health under Section 2310-700 of the Department of Public Health Powers and Duties Law of the Civil Administrative Code of Illinois when the board provides information on immunizations, infectious diseases, medications, or other school health issues to the parents or guardians of students.
    (9) For the purposes of this Section, "nursery schools" means those nursery schools operated by elementary school systems or secondary level school units or institutions of higher learning.

    Sec. 27-23.6. Anti-bias education.
    (a) The General Assembly finds that there is a significant increase in violence in the schools and that much of that violence is the result of intergroup tensions. The General Assembly further finds that anti-bias education and intergroup conflict resolution are effective methods for preventing violence and lessening tensions in the schools and that these methods are most effective when they are respectful of individuals and their divergent viewpoints and religious beliefs, which are protected by the First Amendment to the Constitution of the United States.
    (b) Beginning with the 2002-2003 school year, public elementary and secondary schools may incorporate activities to address intergroup conflict, with the objectives of improving intergroup relations on and beyond the school campus, defusing intergroup tensions, and promoting peaceful resolution of conflict. The activities must be respectful of individuals and their divergent viewpoints and religious beliefs, which are protected by the First Amendment to the Constitution of the United States. Such activities may include, but not be limited to, instruction and teacher training programs.

    Sec. 27-23.7. Bullying prevention.
    (a) The General Assembly finds that a safe and civil school environment is necessary for students to learn and achieve and that bullying causes physical, psychological, and emotional harm to students and interferes with students' ability to learn and participate in school activities. The General Assembly further finds that bullying has been linked to other forms of antisocial behavior, such as vandalism, shoplifting, skipping and dropping out of school, fighting, using drugs and alcohol, sexual harassment, and sexual violence. Because of the negative outcomes associated with bullying in schools, the General Assembly finds that school districts, charter schools, and non-public, non-sectarian elementary and secondary schools should educate students, parents, and school district, charter school, or non-public, non-sectarian elementary or secondary school personnel about what behaviors constitute prohibited bullying.
    Bullying on the basis of actual or perceived race, color, religion, sex, national origin, ancestry, age, marital status, physical or mental disability, military status, sexual orientation, gender-related identity or expression, unfavorable discharge from military service, association with a person or group with one or more of the aforementioned actual or perceived characteristics, or any other distinguishing characteristic is prohibited in all school districts, charter schools, and non-public, non-sectarian elementary and secondary schools. No student shall be subjected to bullying:
        (1) during any school-sponsored education program or
    	
activity;
        (2) while in school, on school property, on school
    	
buses or other school vehicles, at designated school bus stops waiting for the school bus, or at school-sponsored or school-sanctioned events or activities;
        (3) through the transmission of information from a
    	
school computer, a school computer network, or other similar electronic school equipment; or
        (4) through the transmission of information from a
    	
computer that is accessed at a nonschool-related location, activity, function, or program or from the use of technology or an electronic device that is not owned, leased, or used by a school district or school if the bullying causes a substantial disruption to the educational process or orderly operation of a school. This item (4) applies only in cases in which a school administrator or teacher receives a report that bullying through this means has occurred and does not require a district or school to staff or monitor any nonschool-related activity, function, or program.
    (a-5) Nothing in this Section is intended to infringe upon any right to exercise free expression or the free exercise of religion or religiously based views protected under the First Amendment to the United States Constitution or under Section 3 of Article I of the Illinois Constitution.
    (b) In this Section:
    "Bullying" includes "cyber-bullying" and means any severe or pervasive physical or verbal act or conduct, including communications made in writing or electronically, directed toward a student or students that has or can be reasonably predicted to have the effect of one or more of the following:

fear of harm to the student's or students' person or property;
        (2) causing a substantially detrimental effect on the
    	
student's or students' physical or mental health;
        (3) substantially interfering with the student's or

    (Text of Section from P.A. 101-183)
    Sec. 27-24.2. Safety education; driver education course. Instruction shall be given in safety education in each of grades one through 8, equivalent to one class period each week, and any school district which maintains grades 9 through 12 shall offer a driver education course in any such school which it operates. Its curriculum shall include content dealing with Chapters 11, 12, 13, 15, and 16 of the Illinois Vehicle Code, the rules adopted pursuant to those Chapters insofar as they pertain to the operation of motor vehicles, and the portions of the Litter Control Act relating to the operation of motor vehicles. The course of instruction given in grades 10 through 12 shall include an emphasis on the development of knowledge, attitudes, habits, and skills necessary for the safe operation of motor vehicles, including motorcycles insofar as they can be taught in the classroom, and instruction on distracted driving as a major traffic safety issue. In addition, the course shall include instruction on special hazards existing at and required safety and driving precautions that must be observed at emergency situations, highway construction and maintenance zones, and railroad crossings and the approaches thereto. Beginning with the 2017-2018 school year, the course shall also include instruction concerning law enforcement procedures for traffic stops, including a demonstration of the proper actions to be taken during a traffic stop and appropriate interactions with law enforcement. The course of instruction required of each eligible student at the high school level shall consist of a minimum of 30 clock hours of classroom instruction and a minimum of 6 clock hours of individual behind-the-wheel instruction in a dual control car on public roadways taught by a driver education instructor endorsed by the State Board of Education. A school district's decision to allow a student to take a portion of the driver education course through a distance learning program must be determined on a case-by-case basis and must be approved by the school's administration, including the student's driver education teacher, and the student's parent or guardian. Under no circumstances may the student take the entire driver education course through a distance learning program. Both the classroom instruction part and the practice driving part of a driver education course shall be open to a resident or non-resident student attending a non-public school in the district wherein the course is offered. Each student attending any public or non-public high school in the district must receive a passing grade in at least 8 courses during the previous 2 semesters prior to enrolling in a driver education course, or the student shall not be permitted to enroll in the course; provided that the local superintendent of schools (with respect to a student attending a public high school in the district) or chief school administrator (with respect to a student attending a non-public high school in the district) may waive the requirement if the superintendent or chief school administrator, as the case may be, deems it to be in the best interest of the student. A student may be allowed to commence the classroom instruction part of such driver education course prior to reaching age 15 if such student then will be eligible to complete the entire course within 12 months after being allowed to commence such classroom instruction.
    A school district may offer a driver education course in a school by contracting with a commercial driver training school to provide both the classroom instruction part and the practice driving part or either one without having to request a modification or waiver of administrative rules of the State Board of Education if the school district approves the action during a public hearing on whether to enter into a contract with a commercial driver training school. The public hearing shall be held at a regular or special school board meeting prior to entering into such a contract. If a school district chooses to approve a contract with a commercial driver training school, then the district must provide evidence to the State Board of Education that the commercial driver training school with which it will contract holds a license issued by the Secretary of State under Article IV of Chapter 6 of the Illinois Vehicle Code and that each instructor employed by the commercial driver training school to provide instruction to students served by the school district holds a valid teaching license issued under the requirements of this Code and rules of the State Board of Education. Such evidence must include, but need not be limited to, a list of each instructor assigned to teach students served by the school district, which list shall include the instructor's name, personal identification number as required by the State Board of Education, birth date, and driver's license number. Once the contract is entered into, the school district shall notify the State Board of Education of any changes in the personnel providing instruction either (i) within 15 calendar days after an instructor leaves the program or (ii) before a new instructor is hired. Such notification shall include the instructor's name, personal identification number as required by the State Board of Education, birth date, and driver's license number. If the school district maintains an Internet website, then the district shall post a copy of the final contract between the district and the commercial driver training school on the district's Internet website. If no Internet website exists, then the school district shall make available the contract upon request. A record of all materials in relation to the contract must be maintained by the school district and made available to parents and guardians upon request. The instructor's date of birth and driver's license number and any other personally identifying information as deemed by the federal Driver's Privacy Protection Act of 1994 must be redacted from any public materials.
    Such a course may be commenced immediately after the completion of a prior course. Teachers of such courses shall meet the licensure requirements of this Code and regulations of the State Board as to qualifications.
    Subject to rules of the State Board of Education, the school district may charge a reasonable fee, not to exceed $50, to students who participate in the course, unless a student is unable to pay for such a course, in which event the fee for such a student must be waived. However, the district may increase this fee to an amount not to exceed $250 by school board resolution following a public hearing on the increase, which increased fee must be waived for students who participate in the course and are unable to pay for the course. The total amount from driver education fees and reimbursement from the State for driver education must not exceed the total cost of the driver education program in any year and must be deposited into the school district's driver education fund as a separate line item budget entry. All moneys deposited into the school district's driver education fund must be used solely for the funding of a high school driver education program approved by the State Board of Education that uses driver education instructors endorsed by the State Board of Education.

    (a) Each school district shall be entitled to reimbursement for each student who finishes either the classroom instruction part or the practice driving part of a driver education course that meets the minimum requirements of this Act. Reimbursement under this Act is payable from the Drivers Education Fund in the State treasury.
    Each year all funds appropriated from the Drivers Education Fund to the State Board of Education, with the exception of those funds necessary for administrative purposes of the State Board of Education, shall be distributed in the manner provided in this paragraph to school districts by the State Board of Education for reimbursement of claims from the previous school year. As soon as may be after each quarter of the year, if moneys are available in the Drivers Education Fund in the State treasury for payments under this Section, the State Comptroller shall draw his or her warrants upon the State Treasurer as directed by the State Board of Education. The warrant for each quarter shall be in an amount equal to one-fourth of the total amount to be distributed to school districts for the year. Payments shall be made to school districts as soon as may be after receipt of the warrants.
    The base reimbursement amount shall be calculated by the State Board by dividing the total amount appropriated for distribution by the total of: (a) the number of students who have completed the classroom instruction part for whom valid claims have been made times 0.2; plus (b) the number of students who have completed the practice driving instruction part for whom valid claims have been made times 0.8.
    The amount of reimbursement to be distributed on each claim shall be 0.2 times the base reimbursement amount for each validly claimed student who has completed the classroom instruction part, plus 0.8 times the base reimbursement amount for each validly claimed student who has completed the practice driving instruction part.
    (b) The school district which is the residence of a student who attends a nonpublic school in another district that has furnished the driver education course shall reimburse the district offering the course, the difference between the actual per capita cost of giving the course the previous school year and the amount reimbursed by the State, which, for purposes of this subsection (b), shall be referred to as "course cost". If the course cost offered by the student's resident district is less than the course cost of the course in the district where the nonpublic school is located, then the student is responsible for paying the district that furnished the course the difference between the 2 amounts. If a nonpublic school student chooses to attend a driver's education course in a school district besides the district where the nonpublic school is located, then the student is wholly responsible for the course cost; however, the nonpublic school student may take the course in his or her resident district on the same basis as public school students who are enrolled in that district.
    By April 1 the nonpublic school shall notify the district offering the course of the names and district numbers of the nonresident students desiring to take such course the next school year. The district offering such course shall notify the district of residence of those students affected by April 15. The school district furnishing the course may claim the nonresident student for the purpose of making a claim for State reimbursement under this Act.

ARTICLE 27A
CHARTER SCHOOLS

    (105 ILCS 5/27A-1)
    Sec. 27A-1. Short title and application. This Article may be cited as the Charter Schools Law. This Article applies in all school districts, including special charter districts and school districts located in cities having a population of more than 500,000.
(Source: P.A. 89-450, eff. 4-10-96.)

    (105 ILCS 5/27A-2)
    Sec. 27A-2. Legislative declaration.
    (a) The General Assembly finds and declares as follows:
        (1) Encouraging educational excellence is in the best
    	
interests of the people of this State.
        (2) There are educators, community members, and
    	
parents in Illinois who can offer flexible and innovative educational techniques and programs, but who lack an avenue through which to provide them within the public school system.
        (3) The enactment of legislation authorizing charter
    	
schools to operate in Illinois will promote new options within the public school system and will provide pupils, educators, community members, and parents with the stimulus to strive for educational excellence.
    (b) The General Assembly further finds and declares that this Article is enacted for the following purposes:
        (1) To improve pupil learning by creating schools
    	
with high, rigorous standards for pupil performance.
        (2) To increase learning opportunities for all
    	
pupils, with special emphasis on expanded learning experiences for at-risk pupils, consistent, however, with an equal commitment to increase learning opportunities for all other groups of pupils in a manner that does not discriminate on the basis of disability, race, creed, color, gender, national origin, religion, ancestry, marital status, or need for special education services.
        (3) To encourage the use of teaching methods that may
    	
be different in some respects than others regularly used in the public school system.
        (4) To allow the development of new, different, or
    	
alternative forms of measuring pupil learning and achievement.
        (5) To create new professional opportunities for
    	
teachers, including the opportunity to be responsible for the learning program at the school site.
        (6) To provide parents and pupils with expanded
    	
choices within the public school system.
        (7) To encourage parental and community involvement
    	
with public schools.
        (8) To hold charter schools accountable for meeting
    	
rigorous school content standards and to provide those schools with the opportunity to improve accountability.
    (c) In authorizing charter schools, it is the intent of the General Assembly to create a legitimate avenue for parents, teachers, and community members to take responsible risks and create new, innovative, and more flexible ways of educating children within the public school system. The General Assembly seeks to create opportunities within the public school system of Illinois for development of innovative and accountable teaching techniques. The provisions of this Article should be interpreted liberally to support the findings and goals of this Section and to advance a renewed commitment by the State of Illinois to the mission, goals, and diversity of public education.

    (105 ILCS 5/27A-4)
    Sec. 27A-4. General provisions.
    (a) The General Assembly does not intend to alter or amend the provisions of any court-ordered desegregation plan in effect for any school district. A charter school shall be subject to all federal and State laws and constitutional provisions prohibiting discrimination on the basis of disability, race, creed, color, gender, national origin, religion, ancestry, marital status, or need for special education services.
    (b) The total number of charter schools operating under this Article at any one time shall not exceed 120. Not more than 70 charter schools shall operate at any one time in any city having a population exceeding 500,000, with at least 5 charter schools devoted exclusively to students from low-performing or overcrowded schools operating at any one time in that city; and not more than 45 charter schools shall operate at any one time in the remainder of the State, with not more than one charter school that has been initiated by a board of education, or by an intergovernmental agreement between or among boards of education, operating at any one time in the school district where the charter school is located. In addition to these charter schools, up to but no more than 5 charter schools devoted exclusively to re-enrolled high school dropouts and/or students 16 or 15 years old at risk of dropping out may operate at any one time in any city having a population exceeding 500,000. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in subsection (b) of Section 27A-5 of this Code, each such dropout charter may operate up to 15 campuses within the city. Any of these dropout charters may have a maximum of 1,875 enrollment seats, any one of the campuses of the dropout charter may have a maximum of 165 enrollment seats, and each campus of the dropout charter must be operated, through a contract or payroll, by the same legal entity as that for which the charter is approved and certified.
    For purposes of implementing this Section, the State Board shall assign a number to each charter submission it receives under Section 27A-6 for its review and certification, based on the chronological order in which the submission is received by it. The State Board shall promptly notify local school boards when the maximum numbers of certified charter schools authorized to operate have been reached.
    (c) No charter shall be granted under this Article that would convert any existing private, parochial, or non-public school to a charter school.
    (d) Enrollment in a charter school shall be open to any pupil who resides within the geographic boundaries of the area served by the local school board, provided that the board of education in a city having a population exceeding 500,000 may designate attendance boundaries for no more than one-third of the charter schools permitted in the city if the board of education determines that attendance boundaries are needed to relieve overcrowding or to better serve low-income and at-risk students. Students residing within an attendance boundary may be given priority for enrollment, but must not be required to attend the charter school.
    (e) Nothing in this Article shall prevent 2 or more local school boards from jointly issuing a charter to a single shared charter school, provided that all of the provisions of this Article are met as to those local school boards.
    (f) No local school board shall require any employee of the school district to be employed in a charter school.
    (g) No local school board shall require any pupil residing within the geographic boundary of its district to enroll in a charter school.
    (h) If there are more eligible applicants for enrollment in a charter school than there are spaces available, successful applicants shall be selected by lottery. However, priority shall be given to siblings of pupils enrolled in the charter school and to pupils who were enrolled in the charter school the previous school year, unless expelled for cause, and priority may be given to pupils residing within the charter school's attendance boundary, if a boundary has been designated by the board of education in a city having a population exceeding 500,000.
    Beginning with student enrollment for the 2015-2016 school year, any lottery required under this subsection (h) must be administered and videotaped by the charter school. The authorizer or its designee must be allowed to be present or view the lottery in real time. The charter school must maintain a videotaped record of the lottery, including a time/date stamp. The charter school shall transmit copies of the videotape and all records relating to the lottery to the authorizer on or before September 1 of each year.
    Subject to the requirements for priority applicant groups set forth in paragraph (1) of this subsection (h), any lottery required under this subsection (h) must be administered in a way that provides each student an equal chance at admission. If an authorizer makes a determination that a charter school's lottery is in violation of this subsection (h), it may administer the lottery directly. After a lottery, each student randomly selected for admission to the charter school must be notified. Charter schools may not create an admissions process subsequent to a lottery that may operate as a barrier to registration or enrollment.
    Charter schools may undertake additional intake activities, including without limitation student essays, school-parent compacts, or open houses, but in no event may a charter school require participation in these activities as a condition of enrollment. A charter school must submit an updated waitlist to the authorizer on a quarterly basis. A waitlist must be submitted to the authorizer at the same time as quarterly financial statements, if quarterly financial statements are required by the authorizer.
    Dual enrollment at both a charter school and a public school or non-public school shall not be allowed. A pupil who is suspended or expelled from a charter school shall be deemed to be suspended or expelled from the public schools of the school district in which the pupil resides. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this subsection (h):
        (1) any charter school with a mission exclusive to
    	
educating high school dropouts may grant priority admission to students who are high school dropouts and/or students 16 or 15 years old at risk of dropping out and any charter school with a mission exclusive to educating students from low-performing or overcrowded schools may restrict admission to students who are from low-performing or overcrowded schools; "priority admission" for charter schools exclusively devoted to re-enrolled dropouts or students at risk of dropping out means a minimum of 90% of students enrolled shall be high school dropouts; and
        (2) any charter school located in a school district
    	
that contains all or part of a federal military base may set aside up to 33% of its current charter enrollment to students with parents assigned to the federal military base, with the remaining 67% subject to the general enrollment and lottery requirements of subsection (d) of this Section and this subsection (h); if a student with a parent assigned to the federal military base withdraws from the charter school during the course of a school year for reasons other than grade promotion, those students with parents assigned to the federal military base shall have preference in filling the vacancy.
    (i) (Blank).
    (j) Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, a school district in a city having a population exceeding 500,000 shall not have a duty to collectively bargain with an exclusive representative of its employees over decisions to grant or deny a charter school proposal under Section 27A-8 of this Code, decisions to renew or revoke a charter under Section 27A-9 of this Code, and the impact of these decisions, provided that nothing in this Section shall have the effect of negating, abrogating, replacing, reducing, diminishing, or limiting in any way employee rights, guarantees, or privileges granted in Sections 2, 3, 7, 8, 10, 14, and 15 of the Illinois Educational Labor Relations Act.
    (k) In this Section:
    "Low-performing school" means a public school in a school district organized under Article 34 of this Code that enrolls students in any of grades kindergarten through 8 and that is ranked within the lowest 10% of schools in that district in terms of the percentage of students meeting or exceeding standards on the assessments required under Section 2-3.64a-5 of this Code.
    "Overcrowded school" means a public school in a school district organized under Article 34 of this Code that (i) enrolls students in any of grades kindergarten through 8, (ii) has a percentage of low-income students of 70% or more, as identified in the most recently available School Report Card published by the State Board of Education, and (iii) is determined by the Chicago Board of Education to be in the most severely overcrowded 5% of schools in the district. On or before November 1 of each year, the Chicago Board of Education shall file a report with the State Board of Education on which schools in the district meet the definition of "overcrowded school". "Students at risk of dropping out" means students 16 or 15 years old in a public school in a district organized under Article 34 of this Code that enrolls students in any grades 9-12 who have been absent at least 90 school attendance days of the previous 180 school attendance days.
    (l) For advertisements created after January 1, 2015 (the effective date of Public Act 98-783), any advertisement, including a radio, television, print, Internet, social media, or billboard advertisement, purchased by a school district or public school, including a charter school, with public funds must include a disclaimer stating that the advertisement was paid for using public funds.
    This disclaimer requirement does not extend to materials created by the charter school, including, but not limited to, a school website, informational pamphlets or leaflets, or clothing with affixed school logos.

    Sec. 27A-5. Charter school; legal entity; requirements.
    (a) A charter school shall be a public, nonsectarian, nonreligious, non-home based, and non-profit school. A charter school shall be organized and operated as a nonprofit corporation or other discrete, legal, nonprofit entity authorized under the laws of the State of Illinois.
    (b) A charter school may be established under this Article by creating a new school or by converting an existing public school or attendance center to charter school status. Beginning on April 16, 2003 (the effective date of Public Act 93-3), in all new applications to establish a charter school in a city having a population exceeding 500,000, operation of the charter school shall be limited to one campus. The changes made to this Section by Public Act 93-3 do not apply to charter schools existing or approved on or before April 16, 2003 (the effective date of Public Act 93-3).
    (b-5) In this subsection (b-5), "virtual-schooling" means a cyber school where students engage in online curriculum and instruction via the Internet and electronic communication with their teachers at remote locations and with students participating at different times.
    From April 1, 2013 through December 31, 2016, there is a moratorium on the establishment of charter schools with virtual-schooling components in school districts other than a school district organized under Article 34 of this Code. This moratorium does not apply to a charter school with virtual-schooling components existing or approved prior to April 1, 2013 or to the renewal of the charter of a charter school with virtual-schooling components already approved prior to April 1, 2013.
    (c) A charter school shall be administered and governed by its board of directors or other governing body in the manner provided in its charter. The governing body of a charter school shall be subject to the Freedom of Information Act and the Open Meetings Act. No later than January 1, 2021 (one year after the effective date of Public Act 101-291), a charter school's board of directors or other governing body must include at least one parent or guardian of a pupil currently enrolled in the charter school who may be selected through the charter school or a charter network election, appointment by the charter school's board of directors or other governing body, or by the charter school's Parent Teacher Organization or its equivalent.
    (c-5) No later than January 1, 2021 (one year after the effective date of Public Act 101-291) or within the first year of his or her first term, every voting member of a charter school's board of directors or other governing body shall complete a minimum of 4 hours of professional development leadership training to ensure that each member has sufficient familiarity with the board's or governing body's role and responsibilities, including financial oversight and accountability of the school, evaluating the principal's and school's performance, adherence to the Freedom of Information Act and the Open Meetings Act, and compliance with education and labor law. In each subsequent year of his or her term, a voting member of a charter school's board of directors or other governing body shall complete a minimum of 2 hours of professional development training in these same areas. The training under this subsection may be provided or certified by a statewide charter school membership association or may be provided or certified by other qualified providers approved by the State Board of Education.
    (d) For purposes of this subsection (d), "non-curricular health and safety requirement" means any health and safety requirement created by statute or rule to provide, maintain, preserve, or safeguard safe or healthful conditions for students and school personnel or to eliminate, reduce, or prevent threats to the health and safety of students and school personnel. "Non-curricular health and safety requirement" does not include any course of study or specialized instructional requirement for which the State Board has established goals and learning standards or which is designed primarily to impart knowledge and skills for students to master and apply as an outcome of their education.
    A charter school shall comply with all non-curricular health and safety requirements applicable to public schools under the laws of the State of Illinois. On or before September 1, 2015, the State Board shall promulgate and post on its Internet website a list of non-curricular health and safety requirements that a charter school must meet. The list shall be updated annually no later than September 1. Any charter contract between a charter school and its authorizer must contain a provision that requires the charter school to follow the list of all non-curricular health and safety requirements promulgated by the State Board and any non-curricular health and safety requirements added by the State Board to such list during the term of the charter. Nothing in this subsection (d) precludes an authorizer from including non-curricular health and safety requirements in a charter school contract that are not contained in the list promulgated by the State Board, including non-curricular health and safety requirements of the authorizing local school board.
    (e) Except as otherwise provided in the School Code, a charter school shall not charge tuition; provided that a charter school may charge reasonable fees for textbooks, instructional materials, and student activities.
    (f) A charter school shall be responsible for the management and operation of its fiscal affairs including, but not limited to, the preparation of its budget. An audit of each charter school's finances shall be conducted annually by an outside, independent contractor retained by the charter school. To ensure financial accountability for the use of public funds, on or before December 1 of every year of operation, each charter school shall submit to its authorizer and the State Board a copy of its audit and a copy of the Form 990 the charter school filed that year with the federal Internal Revenue Service. In addition, if deemed necessary for proper financial oversight of the charter school, an authorizer may require quarterly financial statements from each charter school.
    (g) A charter school shall comply with all provisions of this Article, the Illinois Educational Labor Relations Act, all federal and State laws and rules applicable to public schools that pertain to special education and the instruction of English learners, and its charter. A charter school is exempt from all other State laws and regulations in this Code governing public schools and local school board policies; however, a charter school is not exempt from the following:
        (1) Sections 10-21.9 and 34-18.5 of this Code

However, a charter school that is established on or after April 16, 2003 (the effective date of Public Act 93-3) and that operates in a city having a population exceeding 500,000 may not contract with a for-profit entity to manage or operate the school during the period that commences on April 16, 2003 (the effective date of Public Act 93-3) and concludes at the end of the 2004-2005 school year. Except as provided in subsection (i) of this Section, a school district may charge a charter school reasonable rent for the use of the district's buildings, grounds, and facilities. Any services for which a charter school contracts with a school district shall be provided by the district at cost. Any services for which a charter school contracts with a local school board or with the governing body of a State college or university or public community college shall be provided by the public entity at cost.
    (i) In no event shall a charter school that is established by converting an existing school or attendance center to charter school status be required to pay rent for space that is deemed available, as negotiated and provided in the charter agreement, in school district facilities. However, all other costs for the operation and maintenance of school district facilities that are used by the charter school shall be subject to negotiation between the charter school and the local school board and shall be set forth in the charter.
    (j) A charter school may limit student enrollment by age or grade level.
    (k) If the charter school is approved by the State Board or Commission, then the charter school is its own local education agency.

    Sec. 27A-6. Contract contents; applicability of laws and regulations.
    (a) A certified charter shall constitute a binding contract and agreement between the charter school and a local school board under the terms of which the local school board authorizes the governing body of the charter school to operate the charter school on the terms specified in the contract.
    (b) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Article, the certified charter may not waive or release the charter school from the State goals, standards, and assessments established pursuant to Section 2-3.64a-5 of this Code. Beginning with the 2003-2004 school year, the certified charter for a charter school operating in a city having a population exceeding 500,000 shall require the charter school to administer any other nationally recognized standardized tests to its students that the chartering entity administers to other students, and the results on such tests shall be included in the chartering entity's assessment reports.
    (c) Subject to the provisions of subsection (e), a material revision to a previously certified contract or a renewal shall be made with the approval of both the local school board and the governing body of the charter school.

    (d) The proposed contract between the governing body of a proposed charter school and the local school board as described in Section 27A-7 must be submitted to and certified by the State Board before it can take effect. If the State Board recommends that the proposed contract be modified for consistency with this Article before it can be certified, the modifications must be consented to by both the governing body of the charter school and the local school board, and resubmitted to the State Board for its certification. If the proposed contract is resubmitted in a form that is not consistent with this Article, the State Board may refuse to certify the charter.
    The State Board shall assign a number to each submission or resubmission in chronological order of receipt, and shall determine whether the proposed contract is consistent with the provisions of this Article. If the proposed contract complies, the State Board shall so certify.
    (e) No renewal of a previously certified contract is effective unless and until the State Board certifies that the renewal is consistent with the provisions of this Article. A material revision to a previously certified contract may go into effect immediately upon approval of both the local school board and the governing body of the charter school, unless either party requests in writing that the State Board certify that the material revision is consistent with the provisions of this Article. If such a request is made, the proposed material revision is not effective unless and until the State Board so certifies.

    (b) A local school board shall, whenever petitioned to do so by 5% or more of the voters of a school district or districts identified in a charter school proposal, order submitted to the voters thereof at a regularly scheduled election the question of whether a new charter school shall be established, which proposal has been found by the State Board to be in compliance with the provisions of this Article, and the secretary shall certify the proposition to the proper election authorities for submission in accordance with the general election law. The proposition shall be in substantially the following form:
        "FOR the establishment of (name of proposed charter
    	
school) under charter school proposal (charter school proposal number).
        AGAINST the establishment of (name of proposed
    	
charter school) under charter school proposal (charter school proposal number)".
    (c) Before circulating a petition to submit the question of whether to establish a charter school to the voters under subsection (b) of this Section, the governing body of a proposed charter school that desires to establish a new charter school by referendum shall submit the charter school proposal to the State Board in the form of a proposed contract to be entered into between the State Board and the governing body of the proposed charter school, together with written notice of the intent to have a new charter school established by referendum. The contract shall comply with the provisions of this Article.
    If the State Board finds that the proposed contract complies with the provisions of this Article, it shall immediately direct the local school board to notify the proper election authorities that the question of whether to establish a new charter school shall be submitted for referendum.
    (d) If the State Board finds that the proposal fails to comply with the provisions of this Article, it shall provide written explanation, detailing its reasons for refusal, to the local school board and to the individuals or organizations submitting the proposal. The State Board shall also notify the local school board and the individuals or organizations submitting the proposal that the proposal may be amended and resubmitted under the same provisions required for an original submission.
    (e) If a majority of the votes cast upon the proposition in each school district designated in the charter school proposal is in favor of establishing a charter school, the local school board shall notify the State Board of the passage of the proposition in favor of establishing a charter school and the State Board shall approve the charter within 7 days after the State Board of Elections has certified that a majority of the votes cast upon the proposition is in favor of establishing a charter school. The State Board shall be the chartering entity for charter schools established by referendum under this Section.

        (14.5) Disclosure of any known active civil or
    	
criminal investigation by a local, state, or federal law enforcement agency into an organization submitting the charter school proposal or a criminal investigation by a local, state, or federal law enforcement agency into any member of the governing body of that organization. For the purposes of this subdivision (14.5), a known investigation means a request for an interview by a law enforcement agency, a subpoena, an arrest, or an indictment. Such disclosure is required for a period from the initial application submission through 10 business days prior to the authorizer's scheduled decision date.
        (15) Any other information reasonably required by the
    	
State Board of Education.
    (b) A proposal to establish a charter school may be initiated by individuals or organizations that will have majority representation on the board of directors or other governing body of the corporation or other discrete legal entity that is to be established to operate the proposed charter school, by a board of education or an intergovernmental agreement between or among boards of education, or by the board of directors or other governing body of a discrete legal entity already existing or established to operate the proposed charter school.

    (i) (Blank).
    (j) Until July 1, 2020, the Commission may charge a charter school that it authorizes a fee, not to exceed 3% of the revenue provided to the school, to cover the cost of undertaking the ongoing administrative responsibilities of the eligible chartering authority with respect to the school. This fee must be deposited into the State Charter School Commission Fund.
    Beginning on July 1, 2020, the State Board of Education may charge a charter school that it authorizes a fee not to exceed 3% of the revenue provided to the school to be used exclusively for covering the cost of authorizing activities.

For purposes of the Successor Agency Act and Section 9b of the State Finance Act, the State Board is declared to be the successor agency of the Commission. Beginning on July 1, 2020, references in statutes, rules, forms, and other documents to the Commission shall, in appropriate contexts, be deemed to refer to the State Board. Standards and procedures of the Commission in effect on July 1, 2020 shall be deemed standards and procedures of the State Board and shall remain in effect until amended or repealed by the State Board.
    Beginning on the effective date of this amendatory Act of the 101st General Assembly, the Commission may not enter into or renew a contract, other than a charter renewal, that expires after July 1, 2020.
    On July 1, 2020, any charter school authorized by the State Charter School Commission prior to July 1, 2020 shall have its authorization transferred to the State Board, which shall then become the school's authorizer for all purposes under this Article. On July 1, 2020, all of the powers, duties, assets, liabilities, contracts, property, records, and pending business of the State Charter School Commission as the school's authorizer must be transferred to the State Board. At the end of its charter term, a charter school may reapply to the board or boards for authorization.
    On July 1, 2020, all rules of the State Board applicable to matters falling within the responsibility of the State Charter School Commission shall be applicable to the actions of the State Board.
    (l) In any appeal filed with the Commission under this Article, both the applicant and the school district in which the charter school plans to locate shall have the right to request a hearing before the Commission.

    Sec. 27A-8. Evaluation of charter proposals.
    (a) This Section does not apply to a charter school established by referendum under Section 27A-6.5. In evaluating any charter school proposal submitted to it, the local school board shall give preference to proposals that:
        (1) demonstrate a high level of local pupil,
    	
parental, community, business, and school personnel support;
        (2) set rigorous levels of expected pupil achievement
    	
and demonstrate feasible plans for attaining those levels of achievement; and
        (3) are designed to enroll and serve a substantial
    	
proportion of at-risk children; provided that nothing in the Charter Schools Law shall be construed as intended to limit the establishment of charter schools to those that serve a substantial portion of at-risk children or to in any manner restrict, limit, or discourage the establishment of charter schools that enroll and serve other pupil populations under a nonexclusive, nondiscriminatory admissions policy.
    (b) In the case of a proposal to establish a charter school by converting an existing public school or attendance center to charter school status, evidence that the proposed formation of the charter school has received majority support from certified teachers and from parents and guardians in the school or attendance center affected by the proposed charter, and, if applicable, from a local school council, shall be demonstrated by a petition in support of the charter school signed by certified teachers and a petition in support of the charter school signed by parents and guardians and, if applicable, by a vote of the local school council held at a public meeting. In the case of all other proposals to establish a charter school, evidence of sufficient support to fill the number of pupil seats set forth in the proposal may be demonstrated by a petition in support of the charter school signed by parents and guardians of students eligible to attend the charter school. In all cases, the individuals, organizations, or entities who initiate the proposal to establish a charter school may elect, in lieu of including any petition referred to in this subsection as a part of the proposal submitted to the local school board, to demonstrate that the charter school has received the support referred to in this subsection by other evidence and information presented at the public meeting that the local school board is required to convene under this Section.
    (c) Within 45 days of receipt of a charter school proposal, the local school board shall convene a public meeting to obtain information to assist the board in its decision to grant or deny the charter school proposal. A local school board may develop its own process for receiving charter school proposals on an annual basis that follows the same timeframes as set forth in this Article. Final decisions of a local school board are subject to judicial review under the Administrative Review Law.
    (d) Notice of the public meeting required by this Section shall be published in a community newspaper published in the school district in which the proposed charter is located and, if there is no such newspaper, then in a newspaper published in the county and having circulation in the school district. The notices shall be published not more than 10 days nor less than 5 days before the meeting and shall state that information regarding a charter school proposal will be heard at the meeting. Copies of the notice shall also be posted at appropriate locations in the school or attendance center proposed to be established as a charter school, the public schools in the school district, and the local school board office.
    (e) Within 30 days of the public meeting, the local school board shall vote, in a public meeting, to either grant or deny the charter school proposal.
    (f) Within 7 days of the public meeting required under subsection (e) of this Section, the local school board shall file a report with the State Board granting or denying the proposal. If the local school board has approved the proposal, within 30 days of receipt of the local school board's report, the State Board shall determine whether the approved charter proposal is consistent with the provisions of this Article and, if the approved proposal complies, certify the proposal pursuant to Section 27A-6.

    (105 ILCS 5/27A-9)
    Sec. 27A-9. Term of charter; renewal.
    (a) For charters granted before January 1, 2017 (the effective date of Public Act 99-840), a charter may be granted for a period not less than 5 and not more than 10 school years. For charters granted on or after January 1, 2017 (the effective date of Public Act 99-840), a charter shall be granted for a period of 5 school years. For charters renewed before January 1, 2017 (the effective date of Public Act 99-840), a charter may be renewed in incremental periods not to exceed 5 school years. For charters renewed on or after January 1, 2017 (the effective date of Public Act 99-840), a charter may be renewed in incremental periods not to exceed 10 school years; however, the State Board or Commission may renew a charter only in incremental periods not to exceed 5 years. Authorizers shall ensure that every charter granted on or after January 1, 2017 (the effective date of Public Act 99-840) includes standards and goals for academic, organizational, and financial performance. A charter must meet all standards and goals for academic, organizational, and financial performance set forth by the authorizer in order to be renewed for a term in excess of 5 years but not more than 10 years. If an authorizer fails to establish standards and goals, a charter shall not be renewed for a term in excess of 5 years. Nothing contained in this Section shall require an authorizer to grant a full 10-year renewal term to any particular charter school, but an authorizer may award a full 10-year renewal term to charter schools that have a demonstrated track record of improving student performance.
    (b) A charter school renewal proposal submitted to the local school board or the State Board or Commission, as the chartering entity, shall contain:
        (1) a report on the progress of the charter school in
    	
achieving the goals, objectives, pupil performance standards, content standards, and other terms of the initial approved charter proposal; and
        (2) a financial statement that discloses the costs of
    	
administration, instruction, and other spending categories for the charter school that is understandable to the general public and that will allow comparison of those costs to other schools or other comparable organizations, in a format required by the State Board.
    (c) A charter may be revoked or not renewed if the local school board or the State Board or Commission, as the chartering entity, clearly demonstrates that the charter school did any of the following, or otherwise failed to comply with the requirements of this law:
        (1) Committed a material violation of any of the
    	
conditions, standards, or procedures set forth in the charter.
        (2) Failed to meet or make reasonable progress toward
    	
achievement of the content standards or pupil performance standards identified in the charter.
        (3) Failed to meet generally accepted standards of
    	
fiscal management.
        (4) Violated any provision of law from which the
    	
charter school was not exempted.
    In the case of revocation, the local school board or the State Board or Commission, as the chartering entity, shall notify the charter school in writing of the reason why the charter is subject to revocation. The charter school shall submit a written plan to the local school board, the State Board, or the Commission, whichever is applicable, to rectify the problem. The plan shall include a timeline for implementation, which shall not exceed 2 years or the date of the charter's expiration, whichever is earlier. If the local school board or the State Board or Commission, as the chartering entity, finds that the charter school has failed to implement the plan of remediation and adhere to the timeline, then the chartering entity shall revoke the charter. Except in situations of an emergency where the health, safety, or education of the charter school's students is at risk, the revocation shall take place at the end of a school year. Nothing in Public Act 96-105 shall be construed to prohibit an implementation timetable that is less than 2 years in duration. No local school board may arbitrarily or capriciously revoke or not renew a charter. Except for extenuating circumstances outlined in this Section, if a local school board revokes or does not renew a charter, it must ensure that all students currently enrolled in the charter school are placed in schools that are higher performing than that charter school, as defined in the State's federal Every Student Succeeds Act accountability plan. In determining whether extenuating circumstances exist, a local school board must detail, by clear and convincing evidence, that factors unrelated to the charter school's accountability designation outweigh the charter school's academic performance.
    (d) (Blank).
    (e) Notice of a local school board's decision to deny, revoke, or not renew a charter shall be provided to the Commission and the State Board. Until July 1, 2020, the Commission may reverse a local board's decision to not renew a charter if the Commission finds that the charter school or charter school proposal (i) is in compliance with this Article, and (ii) is in the best interests of the students it is designed to serve. The Commission may condition the granting of an appeal on the acceptance by the charter school of funding in an amount less than that requested in the proposal submitted to the local school board. Final decisions of the Commission shall be subject to judicial review under the Administrative Review Law.
    The State Board may reverse a local board's decision to revoke or, beginning on July 1, 2020, not renew a charter if the State Board finds that the charter school or charter school proposal (i) is in compliance with this Article and (ii) is in the best interests of the students it is designed to serve. The State Board may condition the granting of an appeal on the acceptance by the charter school of funding in an amount less than that requested in the proposal submitted to the local school board. The State Board must appoint and utilize a hearing officer for any appeals conducted under this subsection. Final decisions of the State Board are subject to judicial review under the Administrative Review Law.
    (f) Notwithstanding other provisions of this Article, if the Commission on appeal reverses a local board's decision or if a charter school is approved by referendum, the Commission shall act as the authorized chartering entity for the charter school. The Commission shall approve the charter and shall perform all functions under this Article otherwise performed by the local school board. The State Board shall determine whether the charter proposal approved by the Commission is consistent with the provisions of this Article and, if the approved proposal complies, certify the proposal pursuant to this Article. The State Board shall report the aggregate number of charter school pupils resident in a school district to that district and shall notify the district of the amount of funding to be paid by the State Board to the charter school enrolling such students. The Commission shall require the charter school to maintain accurate records of daily attendance that shall be deemed sufficient to file claims under Section 18-8.15 notwithstanding any other requirements of that Section. The State Board shall withhold from funds otherwise due the district the funds authorized by this Article to be paid to the charter school and shall pay such amounts to the charter school.
    (g) For charter schools authorized by the Commission, the Commission shall quarterly certify to the State Board the student enrollment for each of its charter schools.
    (h) For charter schools authorized by the Commission, the State Board shall pay directly to a charter school any federal or State aid attributable to a student with a disability attending the school.

    Sec. 27A-10. Employees.
    (a) A person shall be deemed to be employed by a charter school unless a collective bargaining agreement or the charter school contract otherwise provides.
    (b) In all school districts, including special charter districts and districts located in cities having a population exceeding 500,000, the local school board shall determine by policy or by negotiated agreement, if one exists, the employment status of any school district employees who are employed by a charter school and who seek to return to employment in the public schools of the district. Each local school board shall grant, for a period of up to 5 years, a leave of absence to those of its teachers who accept employment with a charter school. At the end of the authorized leave of absence, the teacher must return to the school district or resign; provided that if the teacher chooses to return to the school district, the teacher must be assigned to a position that requires the teacher's licensure and legal qualifications. The contractual continued service status and retirement benefits of a teacher of the district who is granted a leave of absence to accept employment with a charter school shall not be affected by that leave of absence.
    (c) Charter schools shall employ in instructional positions, as defined in the charter, individuals who are licensed under Article 21B of this Code or who possess the following qualifications:

    Sec. 27A-11. Local financing.
    (a) For purposes of the School Code, pupils enrolled in a charter school shall be included in the pupil enrollment of the school district within which the pupil resides. Each charter school (i) shall determine the school district in which each pupil who is enrolled in the charter school resides, (ii) shall report the aggregate number of pupils resident of a school district who are enrolled in the charter school to the school district in which those pupils reside, and (iii) shall maintain accurate records of daily attendance that shall be deemed sufficient to file claims under Section 18-8 or 18-8.15 notwithstanding any other requirements of that Section regarding hours of instruction and teacher certification.
    (b) Except for a charter school established by referendum under Section 27A-6.5, as part of a charter school contract, the charter school and the local school board shall agree on funding and any services to be provided by the school district to the charter school. Agreed funding that a charter school is to receive from the local school board for a school year shall be paid in equal quarterly installments with the payment of the installment for the first quarter being made not later than July 1, unless the charter establishes a different payment schedule. However, if a charter school dismisses a pupil from the charter school after receiving a quarterly payment, the charter school shall return to the school district, on a quarterly basis, the prorated portion of public funding provided for the education of that pupil for the time the student is not enrolled at the charter school. Likewise, if a pupil transfers to a charter school between quarterly payments, the school district shall provide, on a quarterly basis, a prorated portion of the public funding to the charter school to provide for the education of that pupil.
    All services centrally or otherwise provided by the school district including, but not limited to, rent, food services, custodial services, maintenance, curriculum, media services, libraries, transportation, and warehousing shall be subject to negotiation between a charter school and the local school board and paid for out of the revenues negotiated pursuant to this subsection (b); provided that the local school board shall not attempt, by negotiation or otherwise, to obligate a charter school to provide pupil transportation for pupils for whom a district is not required to provide transportation under the criteria set forth in subsection (a)(13) of Section 27A-7.
    In no event shall the funding be less than 97% or more than 103% of the school district's per capita student tuition multiplied by the number of students residing in the district who are enrolled in the charter school.
    It is the intent of the General Assembly that funding and service agreements under this subsection (b) shall be neither a financial incentive nor a financial disincentive to the establishment of a charter school.
    The charter school may set and collect reasonable fees. Fees collected from students enrolled at a charter school shall be retained by the charter school.
    (c) Notwithstanding subsection (b) of this Section, the proportionate share of State and federal resources generated by students with disabilities or staff serving them shall be directed to charter schools enrolling those students by their school districts or administrative units. The proportionate share of moneys generated under other federal or State categorical aid programs shall be directed to charter schools serving students eligible for that aid.
    (d) The governing body of a charter school is authorized to accept gifts, donations, or grants of any kind made to the charter school and to expend or use gifts, donations, or grants in accordance with the conditions prescribed by the donor; however, a gift, donation, or grant may not be accepted by the governing body if it is subject to any condition contrary to applicable law or contrary to the terms of the contract between the charter school and the local school board. Charter schools shall be encouraged to solicit and utilize community volunteer speakers and other instructional resources when providing instruction on the Holocaust and other historical events.
    (e) (Blank).
    (f) The Commission shall provide technical assistance to persons and groups preparing or revising charter applications.
    (g) At the non-renewal or revocation of its charter, each charter school shall refund to the local board of education all unspent funds.
    (h) A charter school is authorized to incur temporary, short term debt to pay operating expenses in anticipation of receipt of funds from the local school board.

    (105 ILCS 5/27A-11.5)
    Sec. 27A-11.5. State financing. The State Board of Education shall make the following funds available to school districts and charter schools:
        (1) From a separate appropriation made to the State
    	
Board for purposes of this subdivision (1), the State Board shall make transition impact aid available to school districts that approve a new charter school or that have funds withheld by the State Board to fund a new charter school that is chartered by the Commission. The amount of the aid shall equal 90% of the per capita funding paid to the charter school during the first year of its initial charter term, 65% of the per capita funding paid to the charter school during the second year of its initial term, and 35% of the per capita funding paid to the charter school during the third year of its initial term. This transition impact aid shall be paid to the local school board in equal quarterly installments, with the payment of the installment for the first quarter being made by August 1st immediately preceding the first, second, and third years of the initial term. The district shall file an application for this aid with the State Board in a format designated by the State Board. If the appropriation is insufficient in any year to pay all approved claims, the impact aid shall be prorated. However, for fiscal year 2004, the State Board of Education shall pay approved claims only for charter schools with a valid charter granted prior to June 1, 2003. If any funds remain after these claims have been paid, then the State Board of Education may pay all other approved claims on a pro rata basis. Transition impact aid shall be paid beginning in the 1999-2000 school year for charter schools that are in the first, second, or third year of their initial term. Transition impact aid shall not be paid for any charter school that is proposed and created by one or more boards of education, as authorized under the provisions of Public Act 91-405.
        (2) From a separate appropriation made for the
    	
purpose of this subdivision (2), the State Board shall make grants to charter schools to pay their start-up costs of acquiring educational materials and supplies, textbooks, electronic textbooks and the technological equipment necessary to gain access to and use electronic textbooks, furniture, and other equipment or materials needed during their initial term. The State Board shall annually establish the time and manner of application for these grants, which shall not exceed $250 per student enrolled in the charter school.
        (3) The Charter Schools Revolving Loan Fund is
    	
created as a special fund in the State treasury. Federal funds, such other funds as may be made available for costs associated with the establishment of charter schools in Illinois, and amounts repaid by charter schools that have received a loan from the Charter Schools Revolving Loan Fund shall be deposited into the Charter Schools Revolving Loan Fund, and the moneys in the Charter Schools Revolving Loan Fund shall be appropriated to the State Board and used to provide interest-free loans to charter schools. These funds shall be used to pay start-up costs of acquiring educational materials and supplies, textbooks, electronic textbooks and the technological equipment necessary to gain access to and use electronic textbooks, furniture, and other equipment or materials needed in the initial term of the charter school and for acquiring and remodeling a suitable physical plant, within the initial term of the charter school. Loans shall be limited to one loan per charter school and shall not exceed $750 per student enrolled in the charter school. A loan shall be repaid by the end of the initial term of the charter school. The State Board may deduct amounts necessary to repay the loan from funds due to the charter school or may require that the local school board that authorized the charter school deduct such amounts from funds due the charter school and remit these amounts to the State Board, provided that the local school board shall not be responsible for repayment of the loan. The State Board may use up to 3% of the appropriation to contract with a non-profit entity to administer the loan program.
        (4) A charter school may apply for and receive,
    	
subject to the same restrictions applicable to school districts, any grant administered by the State Board that is available for school districts.
    If a charter school fails to make payments toward administrative costs, the State Board may withhold State funds from that school until it has made all payments for those costs.

On or before the second Wednesday in January of every even-numbered year, the State Board shall issue a report to the General Assembly and the Governor on its findings for the previous 2 school years.

and progress toward achieving that vision.
        (2) The academic and financial performance of all
    	
operating charter schools overseen by the authorizer, according to the performance expectations for charter schools set forth in this Article.
        (3) The status of the authorizer's charter school
    	
portfolio, identifying all charter schools in each of the following categories: approved (but not yet open), operating, renewed, transferred, revoked, not renewed, voluntarily closed, or never opened.
        (4) The authorizing functions provided by the
    	
authorizer to the charter schools under its purview, including the authorizer's operating costs and expenses detailed in annual audited financial statements, which must conform with generally accepted accounting principles.
    Further, in the report required by this Section, the State Board (i) shall compare the performance of charter school pupils with the performance of ethnically and economically comparable groups of pupils in other public schools who are enrolled in academically comparable courses, (ii) shall review information regarding the regulations and policies from which charter schools were released to determine if the exemptions assisted or impeded the charter schools in meeting their stated goals and objectives, and (iii) shall include suggested changes in State law necessary to strengthen charter schools.
    In addition, the State Board shall undertake and report on periodic evaluations of charter schools that include evaluations of student academic achievement, the extent to which charter schools are accomplishing their missions and goals, the sufficiency of funding for charter schools, and the need for changes in the approval process for charter schools.
    Based on the information that the State Board receives from authorizers and the State Board's ongoing monitoring of both charter schools and authorizers, the State Board has the power to remove the power to authorize from any authorizer in this State if the authorizer does not demonstrate a commitment to high-quality authorization practices and, if necessary, revoke the chronically low-performing charters authorized by the authorizer at the time of the removal. The State Board shall adopt rules as needed to carry out this power, including provisions to determine the status of schools authorized by an authorizer whose authorizing power is revoked.

    (105 ILCS 5/29-3) (from Ch. 122, par. 29-3)
    Sec. 29-3. Transportation in school districts. School boards of community consolidated districts, community unit districts, consolidated districts, consolidated high school districts, optional elementary unit districts, combined high school - unit districts, combined school districts if the combined district includes any district which was previously required to provide transportation, and any newly created elementary or high school districts resulting from a high school - unit conversion, a unit to dual conversion, or a multi-unit conversion if the newly created district includes any area that was previously required to provide transportation shall provide free transportation for pupils residing at a distance of one and one-half miles or more from any school to which they are assigned for attendance maintained within the district, except for those pupils for whom the school board shall certify to the State Board of Education that adequate transportation for the public is available.
    For the purpose of this Act 1 1/2 miles distance shall be from the exit of the property where the pupil resides to the point where pupils are normally unloaded at the school attended; such distance shall be measured by determining the shortest distance on normally traveled roads or streets.
    Such school board may comply with the provisions of this Section by providing free transportation for pupils to and from an assigned school and a pick-up point located not more than one and one-half miles from the home of each pupil assigned to such point.
    For the purposes of this Act "adequate transportation for the public" shall be assumed to exist for such pupils as can reach school by walking, one way, along normally traveled roads or streets less than 1 1/2 miles irrespective of the distance the pupil is transported by public transportation.
    In addition to the other requirements of this Section, each school board may provide free transportation for any pupil residing within 1 1/2 miles from the school attended where conditions are such that walking, either to or from the school to which a pupil is assigned for attendance or to or from a pick-up point or bus stop, constitutes a serious hazard to the safety of the pupil due to either (i) vehicular traffic or rail crossings or (ii) a course or pattern of criminal activity, as defined in Section 10 of the Illinois Streetgang Terrorism Omnibus Prevention Act. Such transportation shall not be provided if adequate transportation for the public is available.
    The determination as to what constitutes a serious safety hazard shall be made by the school board, in accordance with guidelines promulgated by the Illinois Department of Transportation regarding vehicular traffic or rail crossings or in accordance with guidelines regarding a course or pattern of criminal activity, as determined by the local law enforcement agency, in consultation with the State Superintendent of Education. A school board, on written petition of the parent or guardian of a pupil for whom adequate transportation for the public is alleged not to exist because the pupil is required to walk along normally traveled roads or streets where walking is alleged to constitute a serious safety hazard due to either (i) vehicular traffic or rail crossings or (ii) a course or pattern of criminal activity, or who is required to walk between the pupil's home and assigned school or between the pupil's home or assigned school and a pick-up point or bus stop along roads or streets where walking is alleged to constitute a serious safety hazard due to either (i) vehicular traffic or rail crossings or (ii) a course or pattern of criminal activity, shall conduct a study and make findings, which the Department of Transportation, with respect to vehicular traffic or rail crossings, or the State Board of Education, in consultation with the local law enforcement agency, with respect to a course or pattern of criminal activity, shall review and approve or disapprove as provided in this Section, to determine whether a serious safety hazard exists as alleged in the petition. The Department of Transportation shall review the findings of the school board concerning vehicular traffic or rail crossings and shall approve or disapprove the school board's determination that a serious safety hazard exists within 30 days after the school board submits its findings to the Department of Transportation. The State Board of Education, in consultation with the local law enforcement agency, shall review the findings of the school board concerning a course or pattern of criminal activity and shall approve or disapprove the school board's determination that a serious safety hazard exists within 30 days after the school board submits its findings to the State Board. The school board shall annually review the conditions and determine whether or not the hazardous conditions remain unchanged. The State Superintendent of Education may request that the Illinois Department of Transportation or the local law enforcement agency verify that the conditions have not changed. No action shall lie against the school board, the State Superintendent of Education, the Illinois Department of Transportation, the State Board of Education, or a local law enforcement agency for decisions made in accordance with this Section. The provisions of the Administrative Review Law and all amendments and modifications thereof and the rules adopted pursuant thereto shall apply to and govern all proceedings instituted for the judicial review of final administrative decisions of the Department of Transportation, the State Board of Education, or a local law enforcement agency under this Section. At all points, except when otherwise mentioned in this Section, the local enforcement agency is authorized to determine what constitutes a course or pattern of criminal activity.
    The changes made to this Section by this amendatory Act of the 100th General Assembly do not apply to a school district organized under Article 34 of this Code.

Nothing herein shall be construed to prevent high school districts from transporting public or non-public elementary school pupils on a regular route where deemed appropriate. The elementary district in which such pupils reside shall enter into a contractual agreement with the high school district providing the service, make payments accordingly, and make claims to the State in the amount of such contractual payments. The person in charge of any charter school or school other than a public school shall certify on a form to be provided by the State Superintendent of Education, the names and addresses of pupils transported and when such pupils were in attendance at the school. If any such children reside within 1 1/2 miles from the school attended, the school board shall afford such transportation to such children on the same basis as it provides transportation for its own pupils residing within that distance from the school attended.

    (105 ILCS 5/29-5) (from Ch. 122, par. 29-5)
    Sec. 29-5. Reimbursement by State for transportation. Any school district, maintaining a school, transporting resident pupils to another school district's vocational program, offered through a joint agreement approved by the State Board of Education, as provided in Section 10-22.22 or transporting its resident pupils to a school which meets the standards for recognition as established by the State Board of Education which provides transportation meeting the standards of safety, comfort, convenience, efficiency and operation prescribed by the State Board of Education for resident pupils in kindergarten or any of grades 1 through 12 who: (a) reside at least 1 1/2 miles as measured by the customary route of travel, from the school attended; or (b) reside in areas where conditions are such that walking constitutes a hazard to the safety of the child when determined under Section 29-3; and (c) are transported to the school attended from pick-up points at the beginning of the school day and back again at the close of the school day or transported to and from their assigned attendance centers during the school day, shall be reimbursed by the State as hereinafter provided in this Section.
    The State will pay the cost of transporting eligible pupils less the prior year assessed valuation in a dual school district maintaining secondary grades 9 to 12 inclusive times a qualifying rate of .05%; in elementary school districts maintaining grades K to 8 times a qualifying rate of .06%; and in unit districts maintaining grades K to 12, including optional elementary unit districts and combined high school - unit districts, times a qualifying rate of .07%; provided that for optional elementary unit districts and combined high school - unit districts, prior year assessed valuation for high school purposes, as defined in Article 11E of this Code, must be used. To be eligible to receive reimbursement in excess of 4/5 of the cost to transport eligible pupils, a school district shall have a Transportation Fund tax rate of at least .12%. If a school district does not have a .12% Transportation Fund tax rate, the amount of its claim in excess of 4/5 of the cost of transporting pupils shall be reduced by the sum arrived at by subtracting the Transportation Fund tax rate from .12% and multiplying that amount by the district's prior year equalized or assessed valuation, provided, that in no case shall said reduction result in reimbursement of less than 4/5 of the cost to transport eligible pupils.
    The minimum amount to be received by a district is $16 times the number of eligible pupils transported.
    When calculating the reimbursement for transportation costs, the State Board of Education may not deduct the number of pupils enrolled in early education programs from the number of pupils eligible for reimbursement if the pupils enrolled in the early education programs are transported at the same time as other eligible pupils.
    Any such district transporting resident pupils during the school day to an area vocational school or another school district's vocational program more than 1 1/2 miles from the school attended, as provided in Sections 10-22.20a and 10-22.22, shall be reimbursed by the State for 4/5 of the cost of transporting eligible pupils.
    School day means that period of time during which the pupil is required to be in attendance for instructional purposes.
    If a pupil is at a location within the school district other than his residence for child care purposes at the time for transportation to school, that location may be considered for purposes of determining the 1 1/2 miles from the school attended.
    Claims for reimbursement that include children who attend any school other than a public school shall show the number of such children transported.
    Claims for reimbursement under this Section shall not be paid for the transportation of pupils for whom transportation costs are claimed for payment under other Sections of this Act.
    The allowable direct cost of transporting pupils for regular, vocational, and special education pupil transportation shall be limited to the sum of the cost of physical examinations required for employment as a school bus driver; the salaries of full-time or part-time drivers and school bus maintenance personnel; employee benefits excluding Illinois municipal retirement payments, social security payments, unemployment insurance payments and workers' compensation insurance premiums; expenditures to independent carriers who operate school buses; payments to other school districts for pupil transportation services; pre-approved contractual expenditures for computerized bus scheduling; expenditures for housing assistance and homeless prevention under Sections 1-17 and 1-18 of the Education for Homeless Children Act that are not in excess of the school district's actual costs for providing transportation services and are not otherwise claimed in another State or federal grant that permits those costs to a parent, a legal guardian, any other person who enrolled a pupil, or a homeless assistance agency that is part of the federal McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act's continuum of care for the area in which the district is located; the cost of gasoline, oil, tires, and other supplies necessary for the operation of school buses; the cost of converting buses' gasoline engines to more fuel efficient engines or to engines which use alternative energy sources; the cost of travel to meetings and workshops conducted by the regional superintendent or the State Superintendent of Education pursuant to the standards established by the Secretary of State under Section 6-106 of the Illinois Vehicle Code to improve the driving skills of school bus drivers; the cost of maintenance of school buses including parts and materials used; expenditures for leasing transportation vehicles, except interest and service charges; the cost of insurance and licenses for transportation vehicles; expenditures for the rental of transportation equipment; plus a depreciation allowance of 20% for 5 years for school buses and vehicles approved for transporting pupils to and from school and a depreciation allowance of 10% for 10 years for other transportation equipment so used. Each school year, if a school district has made expenditures to the Regional Transportation Authority or any of its service boards, a mass transit district, or an urban transportation district under an intergovernmental agreement with the district to provide for the transportation of pupils and if the public transit carrier received direct payment for services or passes from a school district within its service area during the 2000-2001 school year, then the allowable direct cost of transporting pupils for regular, vocational, and special education pupil transportation shall also include the expenditures that the district has made to the public transit carrier. In addition to the above allowable costs school districts shall also claim all transportation supervisory salary costs, including Illinois municipal retirement payments, and all transportation related building and building maintenance costs without limitation.
    Special education allowable costs shall also include expenditures for the salaries of attendants or aides for that portion of the time they assist special education pupils while in transit and expenditures for parents and public carriers for transporting special education pupils when pre-approved by the State Superintendent of Education.
    Indirect costs shall be included in the reimbursement claim for districts which own and operate their own school buses. Such indirect costs shall include administrative costs, or any costs attributable to transporting pupils from their attendance centers to another school building for instructional purposes. No school district which owns and operates its own school buses may claim reimbursement for indirect costs which exceed 5% of the total allowable direct costs for pupil transportation.
    The State Board of Education shall prescribe uniform regulations for determining the above standards and shall prescribe forms of cost accounting and standards of determining reasonable depreciation. Such depreciation shall include the cost of equipping school buses with the safety features required by law or by the rules, regulations and standards promulgated by the State Board of Education, and the Department of Transportation for the safety and construction of school buses provided, however, any equipment cost reimbursed by the Department of Transportation for equipping school buses with such safety equipment shall be deducted from the allowable cost in the computation of reimbursement under this Section in the same percentage as the cost of the equipment is depreciated.
    On or before August 15, annually, the chief school administrator for the district shall certify to the State Superintendent of Education the district's claim for reimbursement for the school year ending on June 30 next preceding. The State Superintendent of Education shall check and approve the claims and prepare the vouchers showing the amounts due for district reimbursement claims. Each fiscal year, the State Superintendent of Education shall prepare and transmit the first 3 vouchers to the Comptroller on the 30th day of September, December and March, respectively, and the final voucher, no later than June 20.
    If the amount appropriated for transportation reimbursement is insufficient to fund total claims for any fiscal year, the State Board of Education shall reduce each school district's allowable costs and flat grant amount proportionately to make total adjusted claims equal the total amount appropriated.
    For purposes of calculating claims for reimbursement under this Section for any school year beginning July 1, 1998, or thereafter, the equalized assessed valuation for a school district used to compute reimbursement shall be computed in the same manner as it is computed under paragraph (2) of subsection (G) of Section 18-8.05.
    All reimbursements received from the State shall be deposited into the district's transportation fund or into the fund from which the allowable expenditures were made.
    Notwithstanding any other provision of law, any school district receiving a payment under this Section or under Section 14-7.02, 14-7.02b, or 14-13.01 of this Code may classify all or a portion of the funds that it receives in a particular fiscal year or from general State aid pursuant to Section 18-8.05 of this Code as funds received in connection with any funding program for which it is entitled to receive funds from the State in that fiscal year (including, without limitation, any funding program referenced in this Section), regardless of the source or timing of the receipt. The district may not classify more funds as funds received in connection with the funding program than the district is entitled to receive in that fiscal year for that program. Any classification by a district must be made by a resolution of its board of education. The resolution must identify the amount of any payments or general State aid to be classified under this paragraph and must specify the funding program to which the funds are to be treated as received in connection therewith. This resolution is controlling as to the classification of funds referenced therein. A certified copy of the resolution must be sent to the State Superintendent of Education. The resolution shall still take effect even though a copy of the resolution has not been sent to the State Superintendent of Education in a timely manner. No classification under this paragraph by a district shall affect the total amount or timing of money the district is entitled to receive under this Code. No classification under this paragraph by a district shall in any way relieve the district from or affect any requirements that otherwise would apply with respect to that funding program, including any accounting of funds by source, reporting expenditures by original source and purpose, reporting requirements, or requirements of providing services.
    Any school district with a population of not more than 500,000 must deposit all funds received under this Article into the transportation fund and use those funds for the provision of transportation services.

Each custodian intending to file an application for reimbursement under subsection (d) for expenditures incurred or to be incurred with respect to a pupil asserted to be a qualified pupil as an individual referred to in this subsection shall first file with the appropriate regional superintendent, on forms provided by the State Board of Education, a request for a determination that a serious safety hazard within the meaning of this subsection (c) exists with respect to such pupil. Custodians shall file such forms with the appropriate regional superintendents not later than February 1 of the school year for which reimbursement will be sought for transmittal by the regional superintendents to the Department of Transportation not later than February 15; except that any custodian who previously received a determination that a serious safety hazard exists need not resubmit such a request for 4 years but instead may certify on their application for reimbursement to the State Board of Education referred to in subsection (d), that the conditions found to be hazardous, as previously determined by the Department, remain unchanged. The Department shall make its determination on all requests so transmitted to it within 30 days, and shall thereupon forward notice of each determination which it has made to the appropriate regional superintendent for immediate transmittal to the custodian affected thereby. The determination of the Department relative to what constitutes a serious safety hazard within the meaning of subsection (c) with respect to any pupil shall be deemed an "administrative decision" as defined in Section 3-101 of the Administrative Review Law; and the Administrative Review Law and all amendments and modifications thereof and rules adopted pursuant thereto shall apply to and govern all proceedings instituted for the judicial review of final administrative decisions of the Department of Transportation under this subsection.
    (d) Request for reimbursement. A custodian, including a custodian for a pupil asserted to be a qualified pupil as an individual referred to in subsection (c), who applies in accordance with procedures established by the State Board of Education shall be reimbursed in accordance with the dollar limits set out in this Section. Such procedures shall require application no later than June 30 of each year, documentation as to eligibility, and adequate evidence of expenditures; except that for reimbursement sought pursuant to subsection (c) for the 1985-1986 school year, such procedures shall require application within 21 days after the determination of the Department of Transportation with respect to that school year is transmitted by the regional superintendent to the affected custodian. In the absence of contemporaneous records, an affidavit by the custodian may be accepted as evidence of an expenditure. If the amount appropriated for such reimbursement for any year is less than the amount due each custodian, it shall be apportioned on the basis of the requests approved. Regional Superintendents shall be reimbursed for such costs of administering the program, including costs incurred in administering the provisions of subsection (c), as the State Board of Education determines are reasonable and necessary.
    (e) Dollar limit on amount of reimbursement. Reimbursement to custodians for transportation expenses incurred during the 1985-1986 school year, payable in fiscal year 1987, shall be equal to the lesser of (1) the actual qualified transportation expenses, or (2) $50 per pupil. Reimbursement to custodians for transportation expenses incurred during the 1986-1987 school year, payable in fiscal year 1988, shall be equal to the lesser of (1) the actual qualified transportation expenses, or (2) $100 per pupil. For reimbursements of qualified transportation expenses incurred in 1987-1988 and thereafter, the amount of reimbursement shall not exceed the prior year's State reimbursement per pupil for transporting pupils as required by Section 29-3 and other provisions of this Article.
    (f) Rules and regulations. The State Board of Education shall adopt rules to implement this Section.
    (g) The provisions of this amendatory Act of 1986 shall apply according to their terms to the entire 1985-1986 school year, including any portion of that school year which elapses prior to the effective date of this amendatory Act, and to each subsequent school year.
    (h) The chief administrative officer of each school shall notify custodians of qualifying pupils that reimbursements are available. Notification shall occur by the first Monday in November of the school year for which reimbursement is available.

    (105 ILCS 5/29-6.4)
    Sec. 29-6.4. Non-contract transportation; bids; reimbursement. A school board of a school district that provides transportation of its pupils to and from school on buses that are owned by the district that are operated by drivers who are employed by the district shall, if it receives a timely request from an interested private school bus contractor that the district provide that transportation under contract, solicit sealed bids for that purpose. A district or special education cooperative is not required to respond to such a request more than once every 2 years. A request shall not be considered timely if it is made more than 24 months or less than 3 months before the expiration of the collective bargaining or other agreement that is in effect at the time the request is made and that governs the terms and conditions of employment of the school bus drivers employed by the district. All requests shall be made in writing by certified mail, return receipt requested, addressed to the school board of the district at the administrative offices or any school of the district. At the conclusion of the bidding process, the school board shall publicly announce the district's fully allocated costs of providing transportation of its pupils to and from school under its present system and thereupon may (i) elect to enter into a contract as provided in Section 29-6.1 with the lowest responsible bidder for transportation of the district's pupils to and from school or (ii) elect to continue providing transportation of its pupils to and from school under its present system. In the event the school board elects to continue providing transportation of the district's pupils to and from school under its present system even though the district's fully allocated costs of doing so exceed the amount of the lowest responsible bid received by the school board for transportation of the district's pupils to and from school, the school board shall publicly announce at a regularly scheduled meeting of the board held within 30 days after making its election to continue providing pupil transportation under its present system (i) the fully allocated costs of providing transportation of the district's pupils to and from school under its present system, and (ii) the amount of each of the sealed bids submitted to the school board, identifying which of the sealed bid amounts was the lowest responsible bid.
    As used in this Section the term "fully allocated costs" includes both the fixed and variable direct costs of the labor, capital, and material resources that are used by the school district exclusively for purposes of providing transportation of the district's pupils to and from school plus that portion of the district's shared costs as is fairly allocable to the products, services, and facilities necessary to provide transportation of the district's pupils to and from school. Direct costs of labor, capital, and material resources used exclusively to provide pupil transportation include the wages, payroll costs, and associated fringe benefits of school bus drivers, mechanics, and any supervisory or administrative personnel whose services relate exclusively to pupil transportation personnel or services, fuel, lubricants, tires, tubes, related material costs incurred in providing pupil transportation, depreciation costs associated with school buses and other vehicles, including spare vehicles, used to provide pupil transportation, and costs of facilities and equipment maintained exclusively to service, garage, or park vehicles used for pupil transportation purposes. "Shared costs" means the aggregate cost of the labor, capital, and material resources that are used in common by the district for a multiplicity of purposes, including the purpose of providing transportation of the district's pupils to and from school. The costs of the management, administration, and underlying infrastructure that support a multiplicity of services provided by the school district (including pupil transportation services) constitute shared costs within the meaning of this Section, and to the extent they are fairly allocable to pupil transportation services they are included within the term fully allocated costs as used in this Section. The State Board of Education shall promulgate rules setting forth the manner in which a district's fully allocated costs of providing transportation of its pupils to and from school under a non-contractual system shall be determined and computed for purposes of this Section. However, those rules shall be consistent with the provisions of this paragraph and shall follow recognized principles of fully allocated costing analysis in the transit industry, including generally accepted methods of identifying and estimating the principal cost elements of maintaining and operating a pupil transportation system.

The school board may rent such buses and equipment to the county board only for use during times when such buses or equipment are not needed for transporting pupils of the school district. A school board renting school buses or other vehicular equipment under this Section shall make a charge for furnishing such buses or other vehicular equipment in an amount not less than the cost thereof, including a reasonable allowance for the depreciation of each vehicle used.

    (a) Any spouse, natural child, legally adopted child, or step-child of an eligible veteran or serviceperson who possesses all necessary entrance requirements shall, upon application and proper proof, be awarded a MIA/POW Scholarship consisting of the equivalent of 4 calendar years of full-time enrollment including summer terms, to the state supported Illinois institution of higher learning of his choice, subject to the restrictions listed below.
    "Eligible veteran or serviceperson" means any veteran or serviceperson, including an Illinois National Guard member who is on active duty or is active on a training assignment, who has been declared by the U.S. Department of Defense or the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs to be a prisoner of war, be missing in action, have died as the result of a service-connected disability or have become a person with a permanent disability from service-connected causes with 100% disability and who (i) at the time of entering service was an Illinois resident, (ii) was an Illinois resident within 6 months after entering such service, or (iii) is a resident of Illinois at the time of application for the Scholarship and, at some point after leaving such service, was a resident of Illinois for at least 15 consecutive years.
    Full-time enrollment means 12 or more semester hours of courses per semester, or 12 or more quarter hours of courses per quarter, or the equivalent thereof per term. Scholarships utilized by dependents enrolled in less than full-time study shall be computed in the proportion which the number of hours so carried bears to full-time enrollment.
    Scholarships awarded under this Section may be used by a spouse or child without regard to his or her age. The holder of a Scholarship awarded under this Section shall be subject to all examinations and academic standards, including the maintenance of minimum grade levels, that are applicable generally to other enrolled students at the Illinois institution of higher learning where the Scholarship is being used. If the surviving spouse remarries or if there is a divorce between the veteran or serviceperson and his or her spouse while the dependent is pursuing his or her course of study, Scholarship benefits will be terminated at the end of the term for which he or she is presently enrolled. Such dependents shall also be entitled, upon proper proof and application, to enroll in any extension course offered by a State supported Illinois institution of higher learning without payment of tuition and approved fees.
    The holder of a MIA/POW Scholarship authorized under this Section shall not be required to pay any matriculation or application fees, tuition, activities fees, graduation fees or other fees, except multipurpose building fees or similar fees for supplies and materials.
    Any dependent who has been or shall be awarded a MIA/POW Scholarship shall be reimbursed by the appropriate institution of higher learning for any fees which he or she has paid and for which exemption is granted under this Section if application for reimbursement is made within 2 months following the end of the school term for which the fees were paid.
    (b) In lieu of the benefit provided in subsection (a), any spouse, natural child, legally adopted child, or step-child of an eligible veteran or serviceperson, which spouse or child has a physical, mental or developmental disability, shall be entitled to receive, upon application and proper proof, a benefit to be used for the purpose of defraying the cost of the attendance or treatment of such spouse or child at one or more appropriate therapeutic, rehabilitative or educational facilities. The application and proof may be made by the parent or legal guardian of the spouse or child on his or her behalf.
    The total benefit provided to any beneficiary under this subsection shall not exceed the cost equivalent of 4 calendar years of full-time enrollment, including summer terms, at the University of Illinois. Whenever practicable in the opinion of the Department of Veterans' Affairs, payment of benefits under this subsection shall be made directly to the facility, the cost of attendance or treatment at which is being defrayed, as such costs accrue.
    (c) The benefits of this Section shall be administered by and paid for out of funds made available to the Illinois Department of Veterans' Affairs. The amounts that become due to any state supported Illinois institution of higher learning shall be payable by the Comptroller to such institution on vouchers approved by the Illinois Department of Veterans' Affairs. The amounts that become due under subsection (b) of this Section shall be payable by warrant upon vouchers issued by the Illinois Department of Veterans' Affairs and approved by the Comptroller. The Illinois Department of Veterans' Affairs shall determine the eligibility of the persons who make application for the benefits provided for in this Section.

    (a) The General Assembly finds that the Christa McAuliffe federal fellowship is an award expressly and exclusively for the benefit of one or more elementary or secondary teachers, provides funding for a sabbatical for the recipient of the fellowship, has no express relationship to post-secondary educational benefits under State and federal grant and loan programs administered by the Illinois Student Assistance Commission (hereinafter in this Section sometimes referred to as the "Commission"), and therefore is a program that from and after the effective date of this amendatory Act of 1995 should be administered in this State by the State Board of Education.
    (b) There is hereby transferred to the State Board of Education from the Illinois Student Assistance Commission all authority and responsibility exercised by the Commission before the effective date of this amendatory Act of 1995 with respect to the administration within this State of the Christa McAuliffe federal fellowship program. From and after the effective date of this amendatory Act, the State Board of Education shall administer on behalf of the State of Illinois and in accordance with all applicable rules and regulations the conduct and operation of the Christa McAuliffe federal fellowship program within this State.
    (c) The Illinois Student Assistance Commission shall transfer to the State Board of Education, as successor to the Commission for all purposes of administering the Christa McAuliffe federal fellowship program, all books, accounts, records, papers, documents, contracts, agreements, and pending business in the possession or under the control of the Commission and relating to its administration of the Christa McAuliffe fellowship program in this State. All pending applications made before the effective date of this amendatory Act of 1995 for scholarship awards under the Christa McAuliffe fellowship program and all scholarships awarded under that program before the effective date of this amendatory Act of 1995 shall be unaffected by the transfer to the State Board of Education of all responsibilities and authority formerly exercised by the Commission with respect to that program. The Commission shall furnish to the State Board of Education such other information as the State Board of Education may request to assist it in administering this Section.

    (105 ILCS 5/32-1) (from Ch. 122, par. 32-1)
    Sec. 32-1. May vote to organize under general law.
    (a) Any special charter district may, by vote of its electors, cease to control its school under the Act under which it was organized, and become part of the school township or townships in which it is situated. Upon petition of 50 voters of the district, presented to the board having the control and management of the schools, the board shall order submitted to the voters at an election to be held in the district, in accordance with the general election law, the question of "organizing under the general school law". The secretary of the board shall make certification to the proper election authority in accordance with the general election law. If, however, a majority of the votes cast at any such election in any school district subject to Sections 32-3 through 32-4.11 is against organizing the district under the general school law, the question may not again be submitted in the district for 22 months thereafter, and then only upon petition signed by at least 2% of the voters of the school district. Notice shall be given in accordance with the general election law, which notice shall be in the following form:
NOTICE OF REFERENDUM
    Notice is hereby given that on (insert date), a referendum will be held at.... for the purpose of deciding the question of organizing under the general school law. The polls will be opened at .... o'clock ..m and closed at .... o'clock ..m.
Signed .....

    If a majority of the votes cast on the proposition is in favor of organizing under the general school law, then the board having the control and management of schools in the district, shall declare the proposition carried.
    When such a proposition is declared to have so carried, the board of education shall continue to exercise its powers and duties under the general school law. Each member of the board of education selected under the provisions of the special charter shall continue in office until his term has expired. Before the term of each of these members expires, the board shall give notice of an election to be held on the date of the next regular school election, in accordance with the general election law to fill the vacancy which is created. Nomination papers filed under this Section are not valid unless the candidate named therein files with the county clerk or the county board of election commissioners, as the case may be, of the county in which the principal office of the school district is located a receipt from the county clerk showing that the candidate has filed a statement of economic interests as required by the Illinois Governmental Ethics Act. Such receipt shall be so filed either previously during the calendar year in which his nomination papers were filed or within the period for the filing of nomination papers in accordance with the general election law.
    (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, any special charter district whose board is appointed by the mayor or other corporate authority of that municipality may, by resolution adopted by the corporate authorities of that municipality cease to control its school under the Act under which it was organized, become a part of the school township or townships in which it is situated and become organized under the general school law. If such a resolution is adopted, the board of education shall continue to exercise its powers and duties under the general school law. Each member of the board of education selected under the provisions of the special charter shall continue in office until his term has expired. Before the term of each of these members expires, the board shall give notice of an election to be held on the date of the next regular school election, in accordance with the general election law to fill the vacancy which is created.

    Sec. 32-1.1. Election and powers of board - No provision in special act. In all special charter districts maintaining schools under any general school laws, where there is no provision in the special Acts creating such districts for the election of boards of education as otherwise provided, there shall be elected, in lieu of the school directors as now provided, a board of education, to consist of 7 members to be elected at the time and in the manner as provided by the general election law for the election and qualification of boards of education in other cases. In any district having a population of more than 100,000 but less than 2,000,000 such board may be increased in size to 11 members upon adoption by a majority of electors residing in the district and voting on the question in a referendum as provided in this Section. Such question shall be submitted to the electors at an election upon a resolution adopted by the Board. Members shall be elected biennially in the school district, whose term of office shall be 4 years, and there shall also be elected in each odd-numbered year a president of the board. Following the first such election, those members elected, other than the president, shall, by lot, determine 3 to serve 2 years and 3 to serve 4 years; thereafter, all terms shall be 4 years. In other cases, however, if 4 members, other than the president, are elected in 1983, then those elected shall, by lot, determine one to serve for 2 years and 3 to serve 4 years; thereafter all terms shall be 4 years. In neither case shall such determinations affect the biennial selection of the president. At the first regular school election after the adoption by the district electors of a question as provided in this Section increasing the size of the board in those districts entitled to exercise an option for and elect an 11 member board, 4 additional members shall be elected and shall determine by lot 2 to serve for 2 years and 2 for 4 years. Their successors shall serve for a 4 year term. In case of an 11 member board already in existence, if 7 members, other than the president, are elected in 1983 then those members elected shall, by lot determine one to serve 2 years and 6 to serve 4 years. Terms thereafter shall be 4 years. The board of education shall have all the powers and duties of trustees of schools in school townships and the powers and duties of boards of education in districts having a population of not fewer than 1,000 and not more than 500,000 as provided by this Act.
    The day upon which the election provided for in this section is to be held is subject to the provisions of the general election law.

    Upon petition of 10% or 200 of the voters, whichever is less, of any such district requesting a referendum therefor, presented to the managing board thereof, the board shall, or upon its own initiative if no such petition has been presented the board may order submitted to the voters at the next regular election, in accordance with the general election law, a proposition to elect a board of education of 3 or 5 or 7 members, as the case may be. The proposition shall be substantially as follows:
--------------------------------------------------------------
    Shall school district.... be governed
 by a board of education of.... members           YES
 to be elected at the time and in the manner  ----------------
 as boards of education under Article 10          NO

--------------------------------------------------------------
    If more than one proposition is properly presented to the board, the one first presented shall be submitted to the electors.
    If such proposition receives a majority of all valid votes cast thereon, the change in membership shall be effectuated at the next succeeding regular school election. In the conduct of such election, the managing board shall take such measures as may be necessary to arrange for the election of a board of 3, 5, or 7 members, as the case may be. The new board shall be organized as provided in Article 10 of this Act, except that, if only 5 members are to be elected, 2 (instead of 3) shall be selected by lot for a 2 year term, and if only 3 members are to be elected, then one shall be selected by lot for a 2 year term. In case of a 5 member board already established, if 4 are elected in 1983, then those elected shall by lot determine 2 to serve 2 years and 2 to serve 4 years. All successors, except to fill vacancies, shall be elected for terms of 4 years. In the case of a 5 member board already established, on which the members serve 5 year terms, the member elected in 1981 shall serve a 6 year term. The 2 members elected in 1983 shall serve 6 year terms. The 2 members elected in 1985 shall also serve 6 year terms. All successors, except to fill vacancies, shall be elected for terms of 6 years. As soon as the first new board is organized, the terms of all members of the predecessor board shall terminate.
    In any such school district which determines to elect a new board of education as hereinabove authorized, the number of members on the board may thereafter be changed by following the procedure hereinabove set forth.
    At least 22 months must elapse after the date of an election under this section before any of the above propositions may be again submitted to the electors.

The corporate authorities of any special charter district having a population of less than 500,000 governed by a special charter, or special charter and general law, may borrow money for the purpose of building schoolhouses, or repairing, altering and building additions to any schoolhouse already erected, or purchasing schoolhouse sites or purchasing grounds adjoining any schoolhouse site, or separated therefrom only by a public street or way, and shall also include the purchase of school sites outside the boundaries of the school district and building school buildings thereon as provided by Sections 10-22.35 and 10-22.36 of this Act, and may issue its negotiable coupon bonds therefor in such form and such denominations, payable at such place and at such time or times (not exceeding 20 years from date of issuance) and bearing interest at such rate as the corporate authorities may by resolution prescribe. The bonds shall be in denominations of not less than $100 nor more than $5,000, and shall bear interest at a rate not to exceed the maximum rate authorized by the Bond Authorization Act, as amended at the time of the making of the contract, if issued before January 1, 1972 and not to exceed the maximum rate authorized by the Bond Authorization Act, as amended at the time of the making of the contract, if issued after January 1, 1972, payable semi-annually. No money may be borrowed or bonds issued, however, unless the proposition to borrow money and issue bonds for the purpose or purposes and in the amount prescribed in the resolution is certified to the proper election authorities and submitted to the voters of the school district at a regular scheduled election in accordance with the general election law, and the majority of all the votes cast on the proposition is in favor thereof. The corporate authorities may not incur any indebtedness under this Section, which together with all other outstanding indebtedness, exceeds in the aggregate the indebtedness limitation under Section 19-1 of this Act that would be applicable if the district were not a special charter district.
    With respect to instruments for the payment of money issued under this Section either before, on, or after the effective date of this amendatory Act of 1989, it is and always has been the intention of the General Assembly (i) that the Omnibus Bond Acts are and always have been supplementary grants of power to issue instruments in accordance with the Omnibus Bond Acts, regardless of any provision of this Act that may appear to be or to have been more restrictive than those Acts, (ii) that the provisions of this Section are not a limitation on the supplementary authority granted by the Omnibus Bond Acts, and (iii) that instruments issued under this Section within the supplementary authority granted by the Omnibus Bond Acts are not invalid because of any provision of this Act that may appear to be or to have been more restrictive than those Acts.

    (105 ILCS 5/33-1) (from Ch. 122, par. 33-1)
    Sec. 33-1. Board of Education - Election - Terms. In all school districts, including special charter districts having a population of 100,000 and not more than 500,000, which adopt this Article, as hereinafter provided, there shall be maintained a system of free schools in charge of a board of education, which shall be a body politic and corporate by the name of "Board of Education of the City of....". The board shall consist of 7 members elected by the voters of the district. Except as provided in Section 33-1b of this Act, the regular election for members of the board shall be held at the consolidated election in odd numbered years and at the general primary election in even numbered years. The law governing the registration of voters for the primary election shall apply to the regular election. At the first regular election 7 persons shall be elected as members of the board. The person who receives the greatest number of votes shall be elected for a term of 5 years. The 2 persons who receive the second and third greatest number of votes shall be elected for a term of 4 years. The person who receives the fourth greatest number of votes shall be elected for a term of 3 years. The 2 persons who receive the fifth and sixth greatest number of votes shall be elected for a term of 2 years. The person who receives the seventh greatest number of votes shall be elected for a term of 1 year. Thereafter, at each regular election for members of the board, the successors of the members whose terms expire in the year of election shall be elected for a term of 5 years. All terms shall commence on July 1 next succeeding the elections. Any vacancy occurring in the membership of the board shall be filled by appointment until the next regular election for members of the board.
    In any school district which has adopted this Article, a proposition for the election of board members by school board district rather than at large may be submitted to the voters of the district at the regular school election of any year in the manner provided in Section 9-22. If the proposition is approved by a majority of those voting on the propositions, the board shall divide the school district into 7 school board districts as provided in Section 9-22. At the regular school election in the year following the adoption of such proposition, one member shall be elected from each school board district, and the 7 members so elected shall, by lot, determine one to serve for one year, 2 for 2 years, one for 3 years, 2 for 4 years, and one for 5 years. Thereafter their respective successors shall be elected for terms of 5 years. The terms of all incumbent members expire July 1 of the year following the adoption of such a proposition.
    Any school district which has adopted this Article may, by referendum in accordance with Section 33-1a, adopt the method of electing members of the board of education provided in that Section.
    Reapportionment of the voting districts provided for in this Article or created pursuant to a court order, shall be completed pursuant to Section 33-1c.
    A board of education may appoint a student to the board to serve in an advisory capacity. The student member shall serve for a term as determined by the board. The board may not grant the student member any voting privileges, but shall consider the student member as an advisor. The student member may not participate in or attend any executive session of the board.

    (105 ILCS 5/34-1.01) (from Ch. 122, par. 34-1.01)
    Sec. 34-1.01. Intent. The General Assembly has previously established that the primary purpose of schooling is the transmission of knowledge and culture through which children learn in areas necessary to their continuing development, and the General Assembly has defined these areas as including language arts, mathematics, biological, physical and social sciences, the fine arts, and physical development and health. The General Assembly declares its intent to achieve the primary purpose of schooling in elementary and secondary schools subject to this Article, as now or hereafter amended, in cities of over 500,000 inhabitants, through the provisions of this amendatory Act of 1991.
    A. Goals. In the furtherance of this intent, the General Assembly is committed to the belief that, while such urban schools should foster improvement and student growth in a number of areas, first priority should be given to achieving the following goals:
        1. assuring that students show significant progress
    	
toward meeting and exceeding State performance standards in State mandated learning areas, including the mastery of higher order thinking skills in these and other learning areas;
        2. assuring that students attend school regularly and
    	
graduate from high school at rates that equal or surpass national norms;
        3. assuring that students are adequately prepared for
    	
further education and aiding students in making a successful transition to further education;
        4. assuring that students are adequately prepared for
    	
successful entry into employment and aiding students in making a successful transition to employment;
        5. assuring that students are, to the maximum extent
    	
possible, provided with a common learning experience that is of high academic quality and that reflects high expectations for all students' capacities to learn;
        6. assuring that students are better prepared to
    	
compete in the international market place by having foreign language proficiency and stronger international studies;
        7. assuring that students are encouraged in exploring
    	
potential interests in fields such as journalism, drama, art and music;
        8. assuring that individual teachers are granted the
    	
professional authority to make decisions about instruction and the method of teaching;
        9. assuring that students are provided the means to
    	
express themselves creatively and to respond to the artistic expression of others through the visual arts, music, drama and dance; and
        10. assuring that students are provided adequate
    	
athletic programs that encourage pride and positive identification with the attendance center and that reduce the number of dropouts and teenage delinquents.
    B. Achieving goals. To achieve these priority goals, the General Assembly intends to make the individual local school the essential unit for educational governance and improvement and to establish a process for placing the primary responsibility for school governance and improvement in furtherance of such goals in the hands of parents, community residents, teachers, and the school principal at the school level.
    Further, to achieve these priority goals, the General Assembly intends to lodge with the board of education key powers in limited areas related to district-wide policy, so that the board of education supports school-level governance and improvement and carries out functions that can be performed more efficiently through centralized action.
    The General Assembly does not intend to alter or amend the provisions of the desegregation obligations of the board of education, including but not limited to the Consent Decree or the Desegregation Plan in United States v. Chicago Board of Education, 80 C 5124, U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois. Accordingly, the implementation of this amendatory Act of 1991, to the extent practicable, shall be consistent with and, in all cases, shall be subject to the desegregation obligations pursuant to such Consent Decree and Desegregation Plan.

A vacancy on the Council for disqualification may be so declared by the Secretary of the Board. Rules regarding conflicts of interest and disclosure of economic interests promulgated by the Board shall apply to local school council members.

    (3) A person may continue to serve as a teacher member of a local school council as long as he or she is employed and assigned to perform a majority of his or her duties at the school, provided that if the teacher representative resigns from employment with the Board or voluntarily transfers to another school, the teacher's membership on the local school council and all voting rights are terminated immediately as of the date of the teacher's resignation or upon the date of the teacher's voluntary transfer to another school.

(A) To annually evaluate the performance of the principal of the attendance center using a Board approved principal evaluation form, which shall include the evaluation of (i) student academic improvement, as defined by the school improvement plan, (ii) student absenteeism rates at the school, (iii) instructional leadership, (iv) the effective implementation of programs, policies, or strategies to improve student academic achievement, (v) school management, and (vi) any other factors deemed relevant by the local school council, including, without limitation, the principal's communication skills and ability to create and maintain a student-centered learning environment, to develop opportunities for professional development, and to encourage parental involvement and community partnerships to achieve school improvement;
    (B) to determine in the manner provided by subsection (c) of Section 34-2.2 and subdivision 1.5 of this Section whether the performance contract of the principal shall be renewed; and
    (C) to directly select, in the manner provided by subsection (c) of Section 34-2.2, a new principal (including a new principal to fill a vacancy) -- without submitting any list of candidates for that position to the general superintendent as provided in paragraph 2 of this Section -- to serve under a 4 year performance contract; provided that (i) the determination of whether the principal's performance contract is to be renewed, based upon the evaluation required by subdivision 1.5 of this Section, shall be made no later than 150 days prior to the expiration of the current performance-based contract of the principal, (ii) in cases where such performance contract is not renewed -- a direct selection of a new principal -- to serve under a 4 year performance contract shall be made by the local school council no later than 45 days prior to the expiration of the current performance contract of the principal, and (iii) a selection by the local school council of a new principal to fill a vacancy under a 4 year performance contract shall be made within 90 days after the date such vacancy occurs. A Council shall be required, if requested by the principal, to provide in writing the reasons for the council's not renewing the principal's contract.
    1.5. The local school council's determination of whether to renew the principal's contract shall be based on an evaluation to assess the educational and administrative progress made at the school during the principal's current performance-based contract. The local school council shall base its evaluation on (i) student academic improvement, as defined by the school improvement plan, (ii) student absenteeism rates at the school, (iii) instructional leadership, (iv) the effective implementation of programs, policies, or strategies to improve student academic achievement, (v) school management, and (vi) any other factors deemed relevant by the local school council, including, without limitation, the principal's communication skills and ability to create and maintain a student-centered learning environment, to develop opportunities for professional development, and to encourage parental involvement and community partnerships to achieve school improvement. If a local school council fails to renew the performance contract of a principal rated by the general superintendent, or his or her designee, in the previous years' evaluations as meeting or exceeding expectations, the principal, within 15 days after the local school council's decision not to renew the contract, may request a review of the local school council's principal non-retention decision by a hearing officer appointed by the American Arbitration Association. A local school council member or members or the general superintendent may support the principal's request for review. During the period of the hearing officer's review of the local school council's decision on whether or not to retain the principal, the local school council shall maintain all authority to search for and contract with a person to serve as interim or acting principal, or as the principal of the attendance center under a 4-year performance contract, provided that any performance contract entered into by the local school council shall be voidable or modified in accordance with the decision of the hearing officer. The principal may request review only once while at that attendance center. If a local school council renews the contract of a principal who failed to obtain a rating of "meets" or "exceeds expectations" in the general superintendent's evaluation for the previous year, the general superintendent, within 15 days after the local school council's decision to renew the contract, may request a review of the local school council's principal retention decision by a hearing officer appointed by the American Arbitration Association. The general superintendent may request a review only once for that principal at that attendance center. All requests to review the retention or non-retention of a principal shall be submitted to the general superintendent, who shall, in turn, forward such requests, within 14 days of receipt, to the American Arbitration Association. The general superintendent shall send a contemporaneous copy of the request that was forwarded to the American Arbitration Association to the principal and to each local school council member and shall inform the local school council of its rights and responsibilities under the arbitration process, including the local school council's right to representation and the manner and process by which the Board shall pay the costs of the council's representation. If the local school council retains the principal and the general superintendent requests a review of the retention decision, the local school council and the general superintendent shall be considered parties to the arbitration, a hearing officer shall be chosen between those 2 parties pursuant to procedures promulgated by the State Board of Education, and the principal may retain counsel and participate in the arbitration. If the local school council does not retain the principal and the principal requests a review of the retention decision, the local school council and the principal shall be considered parties to the arbitration and a hearing officer shall be chosen between those 2 parties pursuant to procedures promulgated by the State Board of Education. The hearing shall begin (i) within 45 days after the initial request for review is submitted by the principal to the general superintendent or (ii) if the initial request for review is made by the general superintendent, within 45 days after that request is mailed to the American Arbitration Association. The hearing officer shall render a decision within 45 days after the hearing begins and within 90 days after the initial request for review. The Board shall contract with the American Arbitration Association for all of the hearing officer's reasonable and necessary costs. In addition, the Board shall pay any reasonable costs incurred by a local school council for representation before a hearing officer.
    1.10. The hearing officer shall conduct a hearing, which shall include (i) a review of the principal's performance, evaluations, and other evidence of the principal's service at the school, (ii) reasons provided by the local school council for its decision, and (iii) documentation evidencing views of interested persons, including, without limitation, students, parents, local school council members, school faculty and staff, the principal, the general superintendent or his or her designee, and members of the community. The burden of proof in establishing that the local school council's decision was arbitrary and capricious shall be on the party requesting the arbitration, and this party shall sustain the burden by a preponderance of the evidence. The hearing officer shall set the local school council decision aside if that decision, in light of the record developed at the hearing, is arbitrary and capricious. The decision of the hearing officer may not be appealed to the Board or the State Board of Education. If the hearing officer decides that the principal shall be retained, the retention period shall not exceed 2 years.
    2. In the event (i) the local school council does not renew the performance contract of the principal, or the principal fails to receive a satisfactory rating as provided in subsection (h) of Section 34-8.3, or the principal is removed for cause during the term of his or her performance contract in the manner provided by Section 34-85, or a vacancy in the position of principal otherwise occurs prior to the expiration of the term of a principal's performance contract, and (ii) the local school council fails to directly select a new principal to serve under a 4 year performance contract, the local school council in such event shall submit to the general superintendent a list of 3 candidates -- listed in the local school council's order of preference -- for the position of principal, one of which shall be selected by the general superintendent to serve as principal of the attendance center. If the general superintendent fails or refuses to select one of the candidates on the list to serve as principal within 30 days after being furnished with the candidate list, the general superintendent shall select and place a principal on an interim basis (i) for a period not to exceed one year or (ii) until the local school council selects a new principal with 7 affirmative votes as provided in subsection (c) of Section 34-2.2, whichever occurs first. If the local school council fails or refuses to select and appoint a new principal, as specified by subsection (c) of Section 34-2.2, the general superintendent may select and appoint a new principal on an interim basis for an additional year or until a new contract principal is selected by the local school council. There shall be no discrimination on the basis of race, sex, creed, color or disability unrelated to ability to perform in connection with the submission of candidates for, and the selection of a candidate to serve as principal of an attendance center. No person shall be directly selected, listed as a candidate for, or selected to serve as principal of an attendance center (i) if such person has been removed for cause from employment by the Board or (ii) if such person does not hold a valid administrative certificate issued or exchanged under Article 21 and endorsed as required by that Article for the position of principal. A principal whose performance contract is not renewed as provided under subsection (c) of Section 34-2.2 may nevertheless, if otherwise qualified and certified as herein provided and if he or she has received a satisfactory rating as provided in subsection (h) of Section 34-8.3, be included by a local school council as one of the 3 candidates listed in order of preference on any candidate list from which one person is to be selected to serve as principal of the attendance center under a new performance contract. The initial candidate list required to be submitted by a local school council to the general superintendent in cases where the local school council does not renew the performance contract of its principal and does not directly select a new principal to serve under a 4 year performance contract shall be submitted not later than 30 days prior to the expiration of the current performance contract. In cases where the local school council fails or refuses to submit the candidate list to the general superintendent no later than 30 days prior to the expiration of the incumbent principal's contract, the general superintendent may appoint a principal on an interim basis for a period not to exceed one year, during which time the local school council shall be able to select a new principal with 7 affirmative votes as provided in subsection (c) of Section 34-2.2. In cases where a principal is removed for cause or a vacancy otherwise occurs in the position of principal and the vacancy is not filled by direct selection by the local school council, the candidate list shall be submitted by the local school council to the general superintendent within 90 days after the date such removal or vacancy occurs. In cases where the local school council fails or refuses to submit the candidate list to the general superintendent within 90 days after the date of the vacancy, the general superintendent may appoint a principal on an interim basis for a period of one year, during which time the local school council shall be able to select a new principal with 7 affirmative votes as provided in subsection (c) of Section 34-2.2.
    2.5. Whenever a vacancy in the office of a principal occurs for any reason, the vacancy shall be filled in the manner provided by this Section by the selection of a new principal to serve under a 4 year performance contract.
    3. To establish additional criteria to be included as part of the performance contract of its principal, provided that such additional criteria shall not discriminate on the basis of race, sex, creed, color or disability unrelated to ability to perform, and shall not be inconsistent with the uniform 4 year performance contract for principals developed by the board as provided in Section 34-8.1 of the School Code or with other provisions of this Article governing the authority and responsibility of principals.
    4. To approve the expenditure plan prepared by the principal with respect to all funds allocated and distributed to the attendance center by the Board. The expenditure plan shall be administered by the principal. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act or any other law, any expenditure plan approved and administered under this Section 34-2.3 shall be consistent with and subject to the terms of any contract for services with a third party entered into by the Chicago School Reform Board of Trustees or the board under this Act.
    Via a supermajority vote of 7 members of the local school council or 8 members of a high school local school council, the Council may transfer allocations pursuant to Section 34-2.3 within funds; provided that such a transfer is consistent with applicable law and collective bargaining agreements.
    Beginning in fiscal year 1991 and in each fiscal year thereafter, the Board may reserve up to 1% of its total fiscal year budget for distribution on a prioritized basis to schools throughout the school system in order to assure adequate programs to meet the needs of special student populations as determined by the Board. This distribution shall take into account the needs catalogued in the Systemwide Plan and the various local school improvement plans of the local school councils. Information about these centrally funded programs shall be distributed to the local school councils so that their subsequent planning and programming will account for these provisions.
    Beginning in fiscal year 1991 and in each fiscal year thereafter, from other amounts available in the applicable fiscal year budget, the board shall allocate a lump sum amount to each local school based upon such formula as the board shall determine taking into account the special needs of the student body. The local school principal shall develop an expenditure plan in consultation with the local school council, the professional personnel leadership committee and with all other school personnel, which reflects the priorities and activities as described in the school's local school improvement plan and is consistent with applicable law and collective bargaining agreements and with board policies and standards; however, the local school council shall have the right to request waivers of board policy from the board of education and waivers of employee collective bargaining agreements pursuant to Section 34-8.1a.
    The expenditure plan developed by the principal with respect to amounts available from the fund for prioritized special needs programs and the allocated lump sum amount must be approved by the local school council.
    The lump sum allocation shall take into account the following principles:
        a. Teachers: Each school shall be allocated funds
    	
equal to the amount appropriated in the previous school year for compensation for teachers (regular grades kindergarten through 12th grade) plus whatever increases in compensation have been negotiated contractually or through longevity as provided in the negotiated agreement. Adjustments shall be made due to layoff or reduction in force, lack of funds or work, change in subject requirements, enrollment changes, or contracts with third parties for the performance of services or to rectify any inconsistencies with system-wide allocation formulas or for other legitimate reasons.
        b. Other personnel: Funds for other teacher
    	
certificated and uncertificated personnel paid through non-categorical funds shall be provided according to system-wide formulas based on student enrollment and the special needs of the school as determined by the Board.
        c. Non-compensation items: Appropriations for all
    	
non-compensation items shall be based on system-wide formulas based on student enrollment and on the special needs of the school or factors related to the physical plant, including but not limited to textbooks, electronic textbooks and the technological equipment necessary to gain access to and use electronic textbooks, supplies, electricity, equipment, and routine maintenance.
        d. Funds for categorical programs: Schools shall
    	
receive personnel and funds based on, and shall use such personnel and funds in accordance with State and Federal requirements applicable to each categorical program provided to meet the special needs of the student body (including but not limited to, Federal Chapter I, Bilingual, and Special Education).
        d.1. Funds for State Title I: Each school shall
    	
receive funds based on State and Board requirements applicable to each State Title I pupil provided to meet the special needs of the student body. Each school shall receive the proportion of funds as provided in Section 18-8 or 18-8.15 to which they are entitled. These funds shall be spent only with the budgetary approval of the Local School Council as provided in Section 34-2.3.
        e. The Local School Council shall have the right to
    	
request the principal to close positions and open new ones consistent with the provisions of the local school improvement plan provided that these decisions are consistent with applicable law and collective bargaining agreements. If a position is closed, pursuant to this paragraph, the local school shall have for its use the system-wide average compensation for the closed position.
        f. Operating within existing laws and collective
    	
bargaining agreements, the local school council shall have the right to direct the principal to shift expenditures within funds.
        g. (Blank).
    Any funds unexpended at the end of the fiscal year shall be available to the board of education for use as part of its budget for the following fiscal year.
    5.

    7. To approve a school improvement plan developed as provided in Section 34-2.4. The process and schedule for plan development shall be publicized to the entire school community, and the community shall be afforded the opportunity to make recommendations concerning the plan. At least twice a year the principal and local school council shall report publicly on progress and problems with respect to plan implementation.
    8. To evaluate the allocation of teaching resources and other certificated and uncertificated staff to the attendance center to determine whether such allocation is consistent with and in furtherance of instructional objectives and school programs reflective of the school improvement plan adopted for the attendance center; and to make recommendations to the board, the general superintendent and the principal concerning any reallocation of teaching resources or other staff whenever the council determines that any such reallocation is appropriate because the qualifications of any existing staff at the attendance center do not adequately match or support instructional objectives or school programs which reflect the school improvement plan.
    9. To make recommendations to the principal and the general superintendent concerning their respective appointments, after August 31, 1989, and in the manner provided by Section 34-8 and Section 34-8.1, of persons to fill any vacant, additional or newly created positions for teachers at the attendance center or at attendance centers which include the attendance center served by the local school council.
    10. To request of the Board the manner in which training and assistance shall be provided to the local school council. Pursuant to Board guidelines a local school council is authorized to direct the Board of Education to contract with personnel or not-for-profit organizations not associated with the school district to train or assist council members. If training or assistance is provided by contract with personnel or organizations not associated with the school district, the period of training or assistance shall not exceed 30 hours during a given school year; person shall not be employed on a continuous basis longer than said period and shall not have been employed by the Chicago Board of Education within the preceding six months.

Each local school council shall issue and transmit to its school community a detailed annual report accounting for its activities programmatically and financially. Each local school council shall convene at least 2 well-publicized meetings annually with its entire school community. These meetings shall include presentation of the proposed local school improvement plan, of the proposed school expenditure plan, and the annual report, and shall provide an opportunity for public comment.
    13. Each local school council is encouraged to involve additional non-voting members of the school community in facilitating the council's exercise of its responsibilities.
    14. The local school council may adopt a school uniform or dress code policy that governs the attendance center and that is necessary to maintain the orderly process of a school function or prevent endangerment of student health or safety, consistent with the policies and rules of the Board of Education. A school uniform or dress code policy adopted by a local school council: (i) shall not be applied in such manner as to discipline or deny attendance to a transfer student or any other student for noncompliance with that policy during such period of time as is reasonably necessary to enable the student to acquire a school uniform or otherwise comply with the dress code policy that is in effect at the attendance center into which the student's enrollment is transferred; and (ii) shall include criteria and procedures under which the local school council will accommodate the needs of or otherwise provide appropriate resources to assist a student from an indigent family in complying with an applicable school uniform or dress code policy. A student whose parents or legal guardians object on religious grounds to the student's compliance with an applicable school uniform or dress code policy shall not be required to comply with that policy if the student's parents or legal guardians present to the local school council a signed statement of objection detailing the grounds for the objection.
    15. All decisions made and actions taken by the local school council in the exercise of its powers and duties shall comply with State and federal laws, all applicable collective bargaining agreements, court orders and rules properly promulgated by the Board.

The board may establish or impose academic, educational, examination, and experience requirements and criteria that are in addition to those established and required by Article 21 for issuance of a valid certificate endorsed for the position of principal as a condition of the nomination, selection, appointment, employment, or continued employment of a person as principal of any attendance center, or as a condition of the renewal of any principal's performance contract.
    The board shall specify in its formal job description for principals, and from and after July 1, 1990 shall specify in the 4 year performance contracts for use with respect to all principals, that his or her primary responsibility is in the improvement of instruction. A majority of the time spent by a principal shall be spent on curriculum and staff development through both formal and informal activities, establishing clear lines of communication regarding school goals, accomplishments, practices and policies with parents and teachers. The principal, with the assistance of the local school council, shall develop a school improvement plan as provided in Section 34-2.4 and, upon approval of the plan by the local school council, shall be responsible for directing implementation of the plan. The principal, with the assistance of the professional personnel leadership committee, shall develop the specific methods and contents of the school's curriculum within the board's system-wide curriculum standards and objectives and the requirements of the school improvement plan. The board shall ensure that all principals are evaluated on their instructional leadership ability and their ability to maintain a positive education and learning climate. It shall also be the responsibility of the principal to utilize resources of proper law enforcement agencies when the safety and welfare of students and teachers are threatened by illegal use of drugs and alcohol, by illegal use or possession of weapons, or by illegal gang activity.
    Nothing in this Section shall prohibit the board and the exclusive representative of the district's teachers from entering into an agreement under Section 34-85c of this Code to establish alternative procedures for teacher evaluation, remediation, and removal for cause after remediation, including an alternative system for peer evaluation and recommendations, for teachers assigned to schools identified in that agreement.
    On or before October 1, 1989, the Board of Education, in consultation with any professional organization representing principals in the district, shall promulgate rules and implement a lottery for the purpose of determining whether a principal's existing performance contract (including the performance contract applicable to any principal's position in which a vacancy then exists) expires on June 30, 1990 or on June 30, 1991, and whether the ensuing 4 year performance contract begins on July 1, 1990 or July 1, 1991. The Board of Education shall establish and conduct the lottery in such manner that of all the performance contracts of principals (including the performance contracts applicable to all principal positions in which a vacancy then exists), 50% of such contracts shall expire on June 30, 1990, and 50% shall expire on June 30, 1991. All persons serving as principal on May 1, 1989, and all persons appointed as principal after May 1, 1989 and prior to July 1, 1990 or July 1, 1991, in a manner other than as provided by Section 34-2.3, shall be deemed by operation of law to be serving under a performance contract which expires on June 30, 1990 or June 30, 1991; and unless such performance contract of any such principal is renewed (or such person is again appointed to serve as principal) in the manner provided by Section 34-2.2 or 34-2.3, the employment of such person as principal shall terminate on June 30, 1990 or June 30, 1991.
    Commencing on July 1, 1990, or on July 1, 1991, and thereafter, the principal of each attendance center shall be the person selected in the manner provided by Section 34-2.3 to serve as principal of that attendance center under a 4 year performance contract. All performance contracts of principals expiring after July 1, 1990, or July 1, 1991, shall commence on the date specified in the contract, and the renewal of their performance contracts and the appointment of principals when their performance contracts are not renewed shall be governed by Sections 34-2.2 and 34-2.3. Whenever a vacancy in the office of a principal occurs for any reason, the vacancy shall be filled by the selection of a new principal to serve under a 4 year performance contract in the manner provided by Section 34-2.3.
    The board of education shall develop and prepare, in consultation with the organization representing principals, a performance contract for use at all attendance centers, and shall furnish the same to each local school council. The term of the performance contract shall be 4 years, unless the principal is retained by the decision of a hearing officer pursuant to subdivision 1.5 of Section 34-2.3, in which case the contract shall be extended for 2 years. The performance contract of each principal shall consist of the uniform performance contract, as developed or from time to time modified by the board, and such additional criteria as are established by a local school council pursuant to Section 34-2.3 for the performance contract of its principal.
    During the term of his or her performance contract, a principal may be removed only as provided for in the performance contract except for cause. He or she shall also be obliged to follow the rules of the board of education concerning conduct and efficiency.
    In the event the performance contract of a principal is not renewed or a principal is not reappointed as principal under a new performance contract, or in the event a principal is appointed to any position of superintendent or higher position, or voluntarily resigns his position of principal, his or her employment as a principal shall terminate and such former principal shall not be reinstated to the position from which he or she was promoted to principal, except that he or she, if otherwise qualified and certified in accordance with Article 21, shall be placed by the board on appropriate eligibility lists which it prepares for use in the filling of vacant or additional or newly created positions for teachers. The principal's total years of service to the board as both a teacher and a principal, or in other professional capacities, shall be used in calculating years of experience for purposes of being selected as a teacher into new, additional or vacant positions.
    In the event the performance contract of a principal is not renewed or a principal is not reappointed as principal under a new performance contract, such principal shall be eligible to continue to receive his or her previously provided level of health insurance benefits for a period of 90 days following the non-renewal of the contract at no expense to the principal, provided that such principal has not retired.

    (105 ILCS 5/34-8.3) (from Ch. 122, par. 34-8.3)
    Sec. 34-8.3. Remediation and probation of attendance centers.
    (a) The general superintendent shall monitor the performance of the attendance centers within the district and shall identify attendance centers, pursuant to criteria that the board shall establish, in which:
        (1) there is a failure to develop, implement, or
    	
comply with a school improvement plan;
        (2) there is a pervasive breakdown in the educational
    	
program as indicated by factors, including, but not limited to, the absence of improvement in student reading and math achievement scores, an increased drop-out rate, a decreased graduation rate, and a decrease in rate of student attendance;
        (3) (blank); or
        (4) there is a failure or refusal to comply with the
    	
provisions of this Act, other applicable laws, collective bargaining agreements, court orders, or with Board rules which the Board is authorized to promulgate.
    (b) If the general superintendent identifies a nonperforming school as described herein, he or she shall place the attendance center on remediation by developing a remediation plan for the center. The purpose of the remediation plan shall be to correct the deficiencies in the performance of the attendance center by one or more of the following methods:
        (1) drafting a new school improvement plan;
        (2) applying to the board for additional funding for
    	
training for the local school council;
        (3) directing implementation of a school improvement
    	
plan;
        (4) mediating disputes or other obstacles to reform
    	
or improvement at the attendance center.
    If, however, the general superintendent determines that the problems are not able to be remediated by these methods, the general superintendent shall place the attendance center on probation. The board shall establish guidelines that determine the factors for placing an attendance center on probation.
    (c) Each school placed on probation shall have a school improvement plan and school budget for correcting deficiencies identified by the board. The plan shall include specific steps that the local school council and school staff must take to correct identified deficiencies and specific objective criteria by which the school's subsequent progress will be determined. The school budget shall include specific expenditures directly calculated to correct educational and operational deficiencies identified at the school by the probation team.
    (d) Schools placed on probation that, after a maximum of one year, fail to make adequate progress in correcting deficiencies are subject to the following actions by the general superintendent with the approval of the board, after opportunity for a hearing:
        (1) Ordering new local school council elections.
        (2) Removing and replacing the principal.
        (3) Replacement of faculty members, subject to the
    	
provisions of Section 24A-5.
        (4) Reconstitution of the attendance center and
    	
replacement and reassignment by the general superintendent of all employees of the attendance center.
        (5) Intervention under Section 34-8.4.
        (5.5) Operating an attendance center as a contract
    	
turnaround school.
        (6) Closing of the school.
    (e) Schools placed on probation shall remain on probation from year to year until deficiencies are corrected, even if such schools make acceptable annual progress. The board shall establish, in writing, criteria for determining whether or not a school shall remain on probation. If academic achievement tests are used as the factor for placing a school on probation, the general superintendent shall consider objective criteria, not just an increase in test scores, in deciding whether or not a school shall remain on probation. These criteria shall include attendance, test scores, student mobility rates, poverty rates, bilingual education eligibility, special education, and English language proficiency programs, with progress made in these areas being taken into consideration in deciding whether or not a school shall remain on probation.
    (f) Where the board has reason to believe that violations of civil rights, or of civil or criminal law have occurred, or when the general superintendent deems that the school is in educational crisis it may take immediate corrective action, including the actions specified in this Section, without first placing the school on remediation or probation. Nothing described herein shall limit the authority of the board as provided by any law of this State. The board shall develop criteria governing the determination regarding when a school is in educational crisis.
    (g) All persons serving as subdistrict superintendent on May 1, 1995 shall be deemed by operation of law to be serving under a performance contract which expires on June 30, 1995, and the employment of each such person as subdistrict superintendent shall terminate on June 30, 1995. The board shall have no obligation to compensate any such person as a subdistrict superintendent after June 30, 1995.
    (h) The general superintendent shall, in consultation with local school councils, conduct an annual evaluation of each principal in the district pursuant to guidelines promulgated by the Board of Education.

    Sec. 34-8.3a. Financial supervision of attendance centers.
    (a) A fiscal advisor that has been appointed pursuant to subsection (a) of Section 34-2.1 of this Code shall, not later than 90 days after his or her appointment, report to the general superintendent, the board of education, the local school council, and the principal of the school on the progress made in addressing any of the financial deficiencies. If the fiscal advisor determines that the attendance center has rectified all identified deficiencies or has made satisfactory progress in addressing identified deficiencies such that the deficiencies shall be corrected subsequent to the 90-day period, no further action shall be taken by the Board. If, however, the local school council and the principal have not rectified or made satisfactory progress in correcting identified deficiencies, the general superintendent may appoint a financial supervision team, consisting of the fiscal advisor, the general superintendent or his or her designee, and a representative of an outside, independent auditor. Financial supervision teams may develop and implement school budgets to correct the financial irregularities identified in the fiscal advisor's report. The budget shall identify specifically those expenditures that directly correct the irregularities identified in the fiscal advisor's report. Financial supervision teams shall institute systems and procedures necessary to achieve appropriate fiscal management at the school.
    (b) Financial supervision teams may modify an existing school improvement plan only to the extent necessary to implement the school budget it develops. Modifications to a school improvement plan shall include specific steps that the local school council and school staff must take to correct each specific financial irregularity identified by the fiscal advisor's report. The modifications to a school improvement plan shall further specify objective criteria by which the deficiencies identified in the fiscal advisor's report are to be corrected. The local school council and school staff shall be consulted on the school budget and modifications to the school improvement plan to be implemented by the financial supervision team but will have no authority to modify either.
    (c) Upon implementation of the budget developed by the financial supervision team, and accompanying modifications to a school improvement plan, the financial supervision team's authority to conduct fiscal or related educational management of a school shall cease.

    (105 ILCS 5/34-8.4)
    Sec. 34-8.4. Intervention. The Chicago Schools Academic Accountability Council may recommend to the Chicago School Reform Board of Trustees that any school placed on remediation or probation under Section 34-8.3 or schools that for the 3 consecutive school years of 1992-1993, 1993-1994, and 1994-1995 have met the State Board of Education's category of "does not meet expectations" be made subject to intervention under this Section 34-8.4. In addition to any powers created under this Section, the Trustees shall have all powers created under Section 34-8.3 with respect to schools subjected to intervention.
    Prior to subjecting a school to intervention, the Trustees shall conduct a public hearing and make findings of facts concerning the recommendation of the Chicago Schools Academic Accountability Council and the factors causing the failure of the school to adequately perform. The Trustees shall afford an opportunity at the hearing for interested persons to comment about the intervention recommendation. After the hearing has been held and completion of findings of fact, the Trustees shall make a determination whether to subject the school to intervention.
    If the Trustees determine that a school shall be subject to intervention under this Section, the Trustees shall develop an intervention implementation plan and shall cause a performance evaluation to be made of each employee at the school. Upon consideration of such evaluations, and consistent with the intervention implementation plan, the Trustees may reassign, layoff, or dismiss any employees at the attendance center, notwithstanding the provisions of Sections 24A-5 and 34-85.
    The chief educational officer shall appoint a principal for the school and shall set the terms and conditions of the principal's contract, which in no case may be longer than 2 years. The principal shall select all teachers and non-certified personnel for the school as may be necessary. Any provision of Section 34-8.1 that conflicts with this Section shall not apply to a school subjected to intervention under this Section.
    If pursuant to this Section, the general superintendent, with the approval of the board, orders new local school council elections, the general superintendent shall carry out the responsibilities of the local school council for a school subject to intervention until the new local school council members are elected and trained.
    Each school year, 5% of the supplemental general State aid funds distributed to a school subject to intervention during that school year under subsection 5(i)(1)(a) of part A of Section 18-8 or subsection (H) of Section 18-8.05 shall be used for employee performance incentives. The Trustees shall prepare a report evaluating the results of any interventions undertaken pursuant to this Section and shall make recommendations concerning implementation of special programs for dealing with underperforming schools on an ongoing basis. This report shall be submitted to the State Superintendent of Education and Mayor of the City of Chicago by January 1, 1999.

    Sec. 34-8.7. Findings. The General Assembly observes that the Chicago Learning Zone Advisory Committee has issued its report and recommendations. The General Assembly finds, after due consideration of the Committee's report and recommendations, that establishment of a Chicago Learning Zone designation, as the educational version of enterprise zones, will create an opportunity to accelerate the process of Chicago school reform. The General Assembly further finds that the Chicago Learning Zone will offer a fundamental change in operations from a mode of following regulations to an outcome mode, that this change will be one which concentrates on improving academic achievement in ways that can be utilized to reform the system, and that this change will be predicated on the overriding philosophy that attendance centers should be empowered to develop models most appropriate to their situations.
    The General Assembly further observes that the value of a learning experience is determined by the outcomes achieved, not by the time or place of attendance; and, it finds that Learning Zone schools should have the ability to operate without State laws and regulations, board rules, and policies, and the ability to operate with contractual waivable conditions by a vote of the school staff governed by the contracts. Accordingly, the General Assembly finds that the educational needs of the schoolchildren of Chicago will be served by establishing a Chicago Learning Zone.

A copy of the record of convictions obtained from the Department of State Police shall be provided to the applicant for employment. Upon the check of the Statewide Sex Offender Database or Statewide Murderer and Violent Offender Against Youth Database, the school district or regional superintendent shall notify an applicant as to whether or not the applicant has been identified in the Database. If a check of an applicant for employment as a substitute or concurrent part-time teacher or concurrent educational support personnel employee in more than one school district was requested by the regional superintendent, and the Department of State Police upon a check ascertains that the applicant has not been convicted of any of the enumerated criminal or drug offenses in subsection (c) of this Section or has not been convicted, within 7 years of the application for employment with the school district, of any other felony under the laws of this State or of any offense committed or attempted in any other state or against the laws of the United States that, if committed or attempted in this State, would have been punishable as a felony under the laws of this State and so notifies the regional superintendent and if the regional superintendent upon a check ascertains that the applicant has not been identified in the Sex Offender Database or Statewide Murderer and Violent Offender Against Youth Database, then the regional superintendent shall issue to the applicant a certificate evidencing that as of the date specified by the Department of State Police the applicant has not been convicted of any of the enumerated criminal or drug offenses in subsection (c) of this Section or has not been convicted, within 7 years of the application for employment with the school district, of any other felony under the laws of this State or of any offense committed or attempted in any other state or against the laws of the United States that, if committed or attempted in this State, would have been punishable as a felony under the laws of this State and evidencing that as of the date that the regional superintendent conducted a check of the Statewide Sex Offender Database or Statewide Murderer and Violent Offender Against Youth Database, the applicant has not been identified in the Database. The school board of any school district may rely on the certificate issued by any regional superintendent to that substitute teacher, concurrent part-time teacher, or concurrent educational support personnel employee or may initiate its own criminal history records check of the applicant through the Department of State Police and its own check of the Statewide Sex Offender Database or Statewide Murderer and Violent Offender Against Youth Database as provided in this Section. Any unauthorized release of confidential information may be a violation of Section 7 of the Criminal Identification Act.
    (b-5) If a criminal history records check or check of the Statewide Sex Offender Database or Statewide Murderer and Violent Offender Against Youth Database is performed by a regional superintendent for an applicant seeking employment as a substitute teacher with the school district, the regional superintendent may disclose to the State Board of Education whether the applicant has been issued a certificate under subsection (b) based on those checks. If the State Board receives information on an applicant under this subsection, then it must indicate in the Educator Licensure Information System for a 90-day period that the applicant has been issued or has not been issued a certificate.
    (c) The board of education shall not knowingly employ a person who has been convicted of any offense that would subject him or her to license suspension or revocation pursuant to Section 21B-80 of this Code, except as provided under subsection (b) of 21B-80. Further, the board of education shall not knowingly employ a person who has been found to be the perpetrator of sexual or physical abuse of any minor under 18 years of age pursuant to proceedings under Article II of the Juvenile Court Act of 1987. As a condition of employment, the board of education must consider the status of a person who has been issued an indicated finding of abuse or neglect of a child by the Department of Children and Family Services under the Abused and Neglected Child Reporting Act or by a child welfare agency of another jurisdiction.
    (d) The board of education shall not knowingly employ a person for whom a criminal history records check and a Statewide Sex Offender Database check have not been initiated.
    (e) Within 10 days after the general superintendent of schools, a regional office of education, or an entity that provides background checks of license holders to public schools receives information of a pending criminal charge against a license holder for an offense set forth in Section 21B-80 of this Code, the superintendent, regional office of education, or entity must notify the State Superintendent of Education of the pending criminal charge.
    No later than 15 business days after receipt of a record of conviction or of checking the Statewide Murderer and Violent Offender Against Youth Database or the Statewide Sex Offender Database and finding a registration, the general superintendent of schools or the applicable regional superintendent shall, in writing, notify the State Superintendent of Education of any license holder who has been convicted of a crime set forth in Section 21B-80 of this Code. Upon receipt of the record of a conviction of or a finding of child abuse by a holder of any license issued pursuant to Article 21B or Section 34-8.1 or 34-83 of this Code, the State Superintendent of Education may initiate licensure suspension and revocation proceedings as authorized by law. If the receipt of the record of conviction or finding of child abuse is received within 6 months after the initial grant of or renewal of a license, the State Superintendent of Education may rescind the license holder's license.
    (e-5) The general superintendent of schools shall, in writing, notify the State Superintendent of Education of any license holder whom he or she has reasonable cause to believe has committed an intentional act of abuse or neglect with the result of making a child an abused child or a neglected child, as defined in Section 3 of the Abused and Neglected Child Reporting Act, and that act resulted in the license holder's dismissal or resignation from the school district. This notification must be submitted within 30 days after the dismissal or resignation. The license holder must also be contemporaneously sent a copy of the notice by the superintendent. All correspondence, documentation, and other information so received by the State Superintendent of Education, the State Board of Education, or the State Educator Preparation and Licensure Board under this subsection (e-5) is confidential and must not be disclosed to third parties, except (i) as necessary for the State Superintendent of Education or his or her designee to investigate and prosecute pursuant to Article 21B of this Code, (ii) pursuant to a court order, (iii) for disclosure to the license holder or his or her representative, or (iv) as otherwise provided in this Article and provided that any such information admitted into evidence in a hearing is exempt from this confidentiality and non-disclosure requirement. Except for an act of willful or wanton misconduct, any superintendent who provides notification as required in this subsection (e-5) shall have immunity from any liability, whether civil or criminal or that otherwise might result by reason of such action.
    (f) After March 19, 1990, the provisions of this Section shall apply to all employees of persons or firms holding contracts with any school district including, but not limited to, food service workers, school bus drivers and other transportation employees, who have direct, daily contact with the pupils of any school in such district. For purposes of criminal history records checks and checks of the Statewide Sex Offender Database on employees of persons or firms holding contracts with more than one school district and assigned to more than one school district, the regional superintendent of the educational service region in which the contracting school districts are located may, at the request of any such school district, be responsible for receiving the authorization for a criminal history records check prepared by each such employee and submitting the same to the Department of State Police and for conducting a check of the Statewide Sex Offender Database for each employee. Any information concerning the record of conviction and identification as a sex offender of any such employee obtained by the regional superintendent shall be promptly reported to the president of the appropriate school board or school boards.
    (f-5) Upon request of a school or school district, any information obtained by the school district pursuant to subsection (f) of this Section within the last year must be made available to the requesting school or school district.
    (g) Prior to the commencement of any student teaching experience or required internship (which is referred to as student teaching in this Section) in the public schools, a student teacher is required to authorize a fingerprint-based criminal history records check. Authorization for and payment of the costs of the check must be furnished by the student teacher to the school district. Upon receipt of this authorization and payment, the school district shall submit the student teacher's name, sex, race, date of birth, social security number, fingerprint images, and other identifiers, as prescribed by the Department of State Police, to the Department of State Police. The Department of State Police and the Federal Bureau of Investigation shall furnish, pursuant to a fingerprint-based criminal history records check, records of convictions, forever and hereinafter, until expunged, to the president of the board. The Department shall charge the school district a fee for conducting the check, which fee must not exceed the cost of the inquiry and must be deposited into the State Police Services Fund. The school district shall further perform a check of the Statewide Sex Offender Database, as authorized by the Sex Offender Community Notification Law, and of the Statewide Murderer and Violent Offender Against Youth Database, as authorized by the Murderer and Violent Offender Against Youth Registration Act, for each student teacher. The board may not knowingly allow a person to student teach for whom a criminal history records check, a Statewide Sex Offender Database check, and a Statewide Murderer and Violent Offender Against Youth Database check have not been completed and reviewed by the district.
    A copy of the record of convictions obtained from the Department of State Police must be provided to the student teacher. Any information concerning the record of convictions obtained by the president of the board is confidential and may only be transmitted to the general superintendent of schools or his or her designee, the State Superintendent of Education, the State Educator Preparation and Licensure Board, or, for clarification purposes, the Department of State Police or the Statewide Sex Offender Database or Statewide Murderer and Violent Offender Against Youth Database. Any unauthorized release of confidential information may be a violation of Section 7 of the Criminal Identification Act.
    The board may not knowingly allow a person to student teach who has been convicted of any offense that would subject him or her to license suspension or revocation pursuant to subsection (c) of Section 21B-80 of this Code, except as provided under subsection (b) of Section 21B-80. Further, the board may not allow a person to student teach if he or she has been found to be the perpetrator of sexual or physical abuse of a minor under 18 years of age pursuant to proceedings under Article II of the Juvenile Court Act of 1987. The board must consider the status of a person to student teach who has been issued an indicated finding of abuse or neglect of a child by the Department of Children and Family Services under the Abused and Neglected Child Reporting Act or by a child welfare agency of another jurisdiction.

    (b) The Department of Children and Family Services may, in cooperation with school officials, distribute appropriate materials in school buildings listing the toll-free telephone number established in Section 7.6 of the Abused and Neglected Child Reporting Act, including methods of making a report under Section 7 of the Abused and Neglected Child Reporting Act, to be displayed in a clearly visible location in each school building.
    (c) Except for an employee licensed under Article 21B of this Code, if the board determines that any school district employee has willfully or negligently failed to report an instance of suspected child abuse or neglect, as required by the Abused and Neglected Child Reporting Act, then the board may dismiss that employee immediately upon that determination. For purposes of this subsection (c), negligent failure to report an instance of suspected child abuse or neglect occurs when a school district employee personally observes an instance of suspected child abuse or neglect and reasonably believes, in his or her professional or official capacity, that the instance constitutes an act of child abuse or neglect under the Abused and Neglected Child Reporting Act, and he or she, without willful intent, fails to immediately report or cause a report to be made of the suspected abuse or neglect to the Department of Children and Family Services, as required by the Abused and Neglected Child Reporting Act.

The school district may utilize the Illinois Mental Health First Aid training program, established under the Illinois Mental Health First Aid Training Act and administered by certified instructors trained by a national association recognized as an authority in behavioral health, to provide the training and meet the requirements under this Section. If licensed school personnel or an administrator obtains mental health first aid training outside of an in-service training program, he or she may present a certificate of successful completion of the training to the school district to satisfy the requirements of this Section.

    (105 ILCS 5/34-18.9) (from Ch. 122, par. 34-18.9)
    Sec. 34-18.9. Electronic paging devices on school property.
    (a) The General Assembly finds and declares that the educational development of all persons to the limits of their capacities is a fundamental goal of the people of this State, that to achieve such goal it is essential to provide a safe and secure learning environment within the public schools, and that the unrestricted and unregulated use by students of pocket pagers and similar electronic paging devices on school grounds or in school buildings which are owned, occupied or leased by the board of education for school purposes and activities adversely affects the educational environment, welfare and safety of students enrolled in the public schools, in that pocket pagers and similar electronic paging devices are being regularly used for the conduct of unlawful activities during school hours and on school property, including activities directly related to the unlawful possession, sale, delivery or other trafficking in drugs or other substances which constitute a "controlled substance" as that term is defined in the Illinois Controlled Substances Act. It is the purpose and intention of the General Assembly, in enacting this legislation, to reduce or eliminate the occurrence of such unlawful activities during school hours and on school property by restricting and regulating student use or possession of pocket pagers and similar electronic paging devices as provided in this Section, and by providing for the imposition of appropriate discipline and sanctions for any violation of the provisions of this Section.
    (b) No student shall use or have in his or her possession any pocket pager or similar electronic paging device while in any school building or on any school property, during regular school hours or at any other time, unless the use or possession of such device by such student has first been expressly authorized by the principal acting in accordance with standards developed as provided in subsection (c) for the granting of approved exceptions to the general prohibition of this Section against such use or possession.
    (c) The board of education shall develop and promulgate written standards, which shall be furnished by the board of education to each principal, under which a principal:
        (1) may authorize the use or possession of a pocket
    	
pager or similar electronic paging device by a student while in a school building or on school property as an approved exception to the general prohibition of this Section against such use or possession; and
        (2) may impose appropriate discipline or other
    	
sanctions against any student who violates any provision of this Section.

Neither the board nor the local school council may authorize or permit any exception to or exemption from the prohibition at any place or at any time, including without limitation outside of school buildings or before or after the regular school day or on days when school is not in session. "School purposes" include but are not limited to all events or activities or other use of school property that the school board or school officials authorize or permit on school property, including without limitation all interscholastic or extracurricular athletic, academic or other events sponsored by the school board or in which pupils of the district participate. For purposes of this Section "tobacco" shall mean cigarette, cigar, or tobacco in any other form, including smokeless tobacco which is any loose, cut, shredded, ground, powdered, compressed or leaf tobacco that is intended to be placed in the mouth without being smoked.

    (a) The General Assembly finds and declares that the educational development of all persons to the limits of their capacities is a fundamental goal of the people of this State and that to achieve such goal it is essential to provide a safe and secure learning environment within the public schools. While recognizing that cellular radio telecommunication devices may be used for inappropriate activities during school hours and on school property and may, on occasion, cause disruption to the classroom environment, the General Assembly also recognizes that the use of cellular radio telecommunication devices can decrease the response time of officials to emergency situations. In addition, cellular radio telecommunication devices allow parents an additional and timely method of contacting their children should an emergency situation arise. Therefore, it is the purpose and intention of the General Assembly in enacting this legislation to (i) reduce the occurrence of inappropriate and disruptive activities during school hours and on school property occurring through the use of cellular radio telecommunication devices and (ii) increase the safety of students and school personnel during school hours and on school property.
    (b) The board may establish appropriate rules and disciplinary procedures governing the use or possession of cellular radio telecommunication devices by a student while in a school or on school property, during regular school hours, or at any other time.

    Sec. 34-18.43. Establishing an equitable and effective school facility development process.
    (a) The General Assembly finds all of the following:
        (1) The Illinois Constitution recognizes that a
    	
"fundamental goal of the People of the State is the educational development of all persons to the limits of their capacities".
        (2) Quality educational facilities are essential for
    	
fostering the maximum educational development of all persons through their educational experience from pre-kindergarten through high school.
        (3) The public school is a major institution in our
    	
communities. Public schools offer resources and opportunities for the children of this State who seek and deserve quality education, but also benefit the entire community that seeks improvement through access to education.
        (4) The equitable and efficient use of available
    	
facilities-related resources among different schools and among racial, ethnic, income, and disability groups is essential to maximize the development of quality public educational facilities for all children, youth, and adults. The factors that impact the equitable and efficient use of facility-related resources vary according to the needs of each school community. Therefore, decisions that impact school facilities should include the input of the school community to the greatest extent possible.
        (5) School openings, school closings, school
    	
consolidations, school turnarounds, school phase-outs, school construction, school repairs, school modernizations, school boundary changes, and other related school facility decisions often have a profound impact on education in a community. In order to minimize the negative impact of school facility decisions on the community, these decisions should be implemented according to a clear system-wide criteria and with the significant involvement of local school councils, parents, educators, and the community in decision-making.
        (6) The General Assembly has previously stated that
    	
it intended to make the individual school in the City of Chicago the essential unit for educational governance and improvement and to place the primary responsibility for school governance and improvement in the hands of parents, teachers, and community residents at each school. A school facility policy must be consistent with these principles.
    (b) In order to ensure that school facility-related decisions are made with the input of the community and reflect educationally sound and fiscally responsible criteria, a Chicago Educational Facilities Task Force shall be established within 15 days after the effective date of this amendatory Act of the 96th General Assembly.
    (c) The Chicago Educational Facilities Task Force shall consist of all of the following members:
        (1) Two members of the House of Representatives
    	
appointed by the Speaker of the House, at least one of whom shall be a member of the Elementary & Secondary Education Committee.
        (2) Two members of the House of Representatives
    	
appointed by the Minority Leader of the House, at least one of whom shall be a member of the Elementary & Secondary Education Committee.
        (3) Two members of the Senate appointed by the
    	
President of the Senate, at least one of whom shall be a member of the Education Committee.
        (4) Two members of the Senate appointed by the
    	
Minority Leader of the Senate, at least one of whom shall be a member of the Education Committee.
        (5) Two representatives of school community
    	
organizations with past involvement in school facility issues appointed by the Speaker of the House.

        (1) If the Governor has declared a disaster due to a
    	
public health emergency pursuant to Section 7 of the Illinois Emergency Management Agency Act, the State Superintendent of Education may declare a requirement to use remote learning days or blended remote learning days for the school district, multiple school districts, a region, or the entire State. During remote learning days, schools shall conduct instruction remotely. During blended remote learning days, schools may utilize hybrid models of in-person and remote instruction. Once declared, remote learning days or blended remote learning days shall be implemented in grades pre-kindergarten through 12 as days of attendance and shall be deemed pupil attendance days for calculation of the length of a school term under Section 10-19.
        (2) For purposes of this Section, a remote learning
    	
day or blended remote learning day may be met through the district's implementation of an e-learning program under Section 10-20.56.
        (3) If the district does not implement an e-learning
    	
program under Section 10-20.56, the district shall adopt a remote and blended remote learning day plan approved by the general superintendent of schools. The district may utilize remote and blended remote learning planning days, consecutively or in separate increments, to develop, review, or amend its remote and blended remote learning day plan or provide professional development to staff regarding remote education. Up to 5 remote and blended remote learning planning days may be deemed pupil attendance days for calculation of the length of a school term under Section 10-19.
        (4) Each remote and blended remote learning day plan
    	
shall address the following:
            (i) accessibility of the remote instruction to
        	
all students enrolled in the district;
            (ii) if applicable, a requirement that the remote
        	
learning day and blended remote learning day activities reflect State learning standards;
            (iii) a means for students to confer with an
        	
educator, as necessary;
            (iv) the unique needs of students in special
        	
populations, including, but not limited to, students eligible for special education under Article 14, students who are English learners as defined in Section 14C-2, and students experiencing homelessness under the Education for Homeless Children Act, or vulnerable student populations;
            (v) how the district will take attendance and
        	
monitor and verify each student's remote participation; and
            (vi) transitions from remote learning to on-site
        	
learning upon the State Superintendent's declaration that remote learning days or blended remote learning days are no longer deemed necessary.
        (5) The general superintendent of schools shall
    	
periodically review and amend the district's remote and blended remote learning day plan, as needed, to ensure the plan meets the needs of all students.
        (6) Each remote and blended remote learning day plan
    	
shall be posted on the district's Internet website where other policies, rules, and standards of conduct are posted and shall be provided to students and faculty.
        (7) This Section does not create any additional
    	
employee bargaining rights and does not remove any employee bargaining rights.
        (8) Statutory and regulatory curricular mandates and
    	
offerings may be administered via the district's remote and blended remote learning day plan, except that the district may not offer individual behind-the-wheel instruction required by Section 27-24.2 via the district's remote and blended remote learning day plan. This Section does not relieve schools and the district from completing all statutory and regulatory curricular mandates and offerings.

    Sec. 34-21. Rentals and leases - Sale of real estate - Engagement of real estate broker - Indirect and participating ownership interest - Conveyance, payment and disclosure.
    (a) The board may:
        (1) enter into leases as lessee of buildings, rooms
    	
and grounds for the use of schools or for the purpose of school administration; or
        (2) enter into leases as lessor of property held by a
    	
city in trust for the use and benefit of schools for a term of not longer than 99 years from the date of the granting of the lease, but it shall not make or renew any lease for a term longer than 10 years nor alter the provisions of any lease whose unexpired term may exceed 10 years without the vote of 2/3 of the full membership of the board. The board may, in the case of such a lease, receive consideration in whole or in part in the form of an ownership interest in the entity leasing the property from the board, or in its assignee, or a participating interest in the revenues, profits or gains from the development, use, sublease or assignment of such property or interest therein; provided, however, that the board shall not make any further contribution to the capital of such entity. Furthermore, there shall be no diminution thereafter in the value of the board's interest in the entity or participating interest as a result of any subsequent capital contributions by any entity or other capital changes.
    (b) The board may sell real estate, or interest therein, held by a city in trust for the use and benefit of the schools subject to the provisions of this Section and approval by the board ordered by a vote of not less than 2/3 of its full membership, if the board determines (i) that such real estate has become unnecessary, unsuitable or inconvenient for the use of schools or for the purpose of school administration, (ii) that such real estate has become inappropriate or unprofitable for the purpose of deriving revenue to support the board's authorized purposes, or (iii) that, in the reasonable judgment of the board, a sale would constitute the best available use or disposition of such real estate for the purpose of deriving revenue to support the board's authorized purposes.
        (1) Any sale of such real estate having a fair market
    	
value of $25,000 or more shall be made in accordance with the following procedures:
            (A) Notice of intended sale shall be published
        	
once each week for 3 consecutive weeks in a daily or weekly newspaper published in the city.
            (B) The first such notice shall be published not
        	
less than 30 days before the day provided for the opening of bids with respect to the intended sale.
            (C) The notice shall contain pertinent
        	
information on the real estate available for sale, including the location of the real estate, a description of the property, the purpose for which it is used, any other terms for the sale of the real estate as determined by the board, and the dates on which bids will be opened, and on which bids will be considered, and the notice shall advertise for bids for such real estate. The notice may contain a minimum sale price.
            (D) The board may:
                (i) accept the highest responsible bid
            	
determined to be in the best interest of the board; or
                (ii) reject any and all bids; or
                (iii) if there is more than one responsible
            	
bid, negotiate separately with the 2 highest and best among such responsible bids and, upon tentative agreement with one or both bidders, one or both of such bids may be submitted to the board for acceptance of one or rejection of both. Such negotiations may not result in a diminution of the terms of the sale of the real estate and must result in an agreement which is, in the reasonable judgment of the board, equal to or higher in value than the highest responsible bid.
        The board may receive consideration for the sale of
    	
such real estate, in whole or in part, in the form of an ownership interest in the entity acquiring title to the property by such sale, or in its assignee, or a participating interest in the revenues, profits or gains from the development, use, sale, lease or assignment of such property or interest therein; provided, however, that the board shall not make any further contribution to the capital of such entity. The present value of the ownership or participating interest to be received by the board shall, in the reasonable judgement of the board, be at least as great as the value of the highest responsible cash bid for such property or the agreed cash price and terms of sale negotiated pursuant to this subsection, if any, whichever is higher. Furthermore, there shall be no diminution thereafter in the value of the board's interest in the entity or its participating interest in the property as a result of any subsequent capital contributions by any entity or other capital changes.
        (2) Any sale of such real estate having a fair market
    	
value of less than $25,000 may be negotiated and shall not require notice or competitive bids.
        (3) Any sale of such real estate having a fair market
    	
value of more than $25,000 which has been continuously leased by the same entity and used as a school attendance center for at least 10 years may be negotiated and shall not require notice or competitive bids.
    (c) The board may engage the services of a licensed real estate broker at a fair and reasonable commission in any case involving the sale or lease of real estate when by resolution the board determines such services to be in the best interest of the board; provided, however, that the commission to be paid may not exceed in the case of sale 7% of the sale price, and in the case of lease 7% of the first year's rent and 2% of the base rent of each lease year thereafter not to exceed 4 years. The above stated maximum ceilings on commissions may be raised by not less than a 3/4 vote of the board's full membership. Payment of the commission shall be contingent upon conveyance in accordance with the provisions of this Section and within a reasonable period of time thereafter as determined by the board at the time of the engagement of the real estate broker.
    (d) (1) Conveyance of real estate held in trust by the city for the use and benefit of schools shall be by action of the city council in its capacity as trustee upon notice by the board pursuant to resolution that a sale of real estate, or interest therein, has been made in accordance with the provisions of this Section.
    (2) Payment in consideration of a transfer of real estate, or interest therein, may be accepted by the board in cash, a combination of cash and securities or in another form described in subsections (a) or (b) of this Section. In any case where an instrument is accepted as part payment, the debt shall be adequately secured by mortgage, trust deed, or if by contract by retention of title, on the property transferred and any such security interest shall not be released until the debt is fully paid. Payments made after the date of sale shall include interest on the outstanding balance computed from the date of sale to the date of payment at rates to be determined by the board.
    (3) The board may not consummate any transaction involving the transfer of real estate, or interest therein, provided for in this Section in which there may be an undisclosed principal. Any conveyance of title or other interest in real estate in violation hereof shall be void and any consideration received by the board prior to the discovery of such violation shall be retained as liquidated damages.

Under such agreements the board also may lease to another party to such agreement real estate and existing improvements which are appropriate and available for use as part of the necessary school buildings and related property and facilities for an agricultural science school. Any interest created by such a lease shall be exempt from any form of leasehold tax or assessment, and the interests of the board as owner or lessor of property covered by such a lease may be subordinated to the interests of a mortgage holder or holders acquired as security for additional improvements made on the property.

    Sec. 34-21.6. Waiver of fees.
    (a) The board shall waive all fees assessed by the district on children whose parents are unable to afford them, including but not limited to children living in households that meet the free lunch or breakfast eligibility guidelines established by the federal government pursuant to Section 1758 of the federal Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act (42 U.S.C. 1758; 7 C.F.R. 245 et seq.), subject to verification as set forth in subsection (b) of this Section. The board shall develop written policies and procedures implementing this Section in accordance with regulations promulgated by the State Board of Education.
    (b) If the board participates in a federally funded, school-based child nutrition program and uses a student's application for, eligibility for, or participation in the federally funded, school-based child nutrition program (42 U.S.C. 1758; 7 C.F.R. 245 et seq.) as the basis for waiving fees assessed by the district, then the board must follow the verification requirements of the federally funded, school-based child nutrition program (42 U.S.C. 1758; 7 C.F.R. 245.6a).
    If the board establishes a process for the determination of eligibility for waiver of fees assessed by the district that is completely independent of a student's application for, eligibility for, or participation in a federally funded, school-based child nutrition program, the board may provide for fee waiver verification no more often than every 60 calendar days. Information obtained during the independent, fee waiver verification process indicating that the student does not meet free lunch or breakfast eligibility guidelines may be used to deny the waiver of the student's fees, provided that any information obtained through this independent process for determining or verifying eligibility for fee waivers shall not be used to determine or verify eligibility for any federally funded, school-based child nutrition program.

For the purpose of erecting, purchasing, or otherwise acquiring buildings suitable for school houses, erecting temporary school structures, erecting additions to, repairing, rehabilitating, modernizing and replacing existing school buildings and temporary school structures, and furnishing and equipping school buildings and temporary school structures, and purchasing or otherwise acquiring and improving sites for such purposes, the board may incur an indebtedness and issue bonds therefor in an amount or amounts not to exceed in the aggregate $150,000,000 in addition to the bonds authorized under Sections 34-22.1, 34-22.2, 34-22.3, 34-22.4, 34-22.5 and 34-22.7. Bonds authorized under this Section may also be issued for the purposes of paying interest on such bonds, establishing reserves to secure such bonds and paying the costs of issuance of such bonds. In connection with the issuance of its bonds, the board may enter into arrangements to provide additional security and liquidity for the bonds. These may include, without limitation, municipal bond insurance, letters of credit, lines of credit by which the board may borrow funds to pay or redeem its bonds and purchase or remarketing arrangements for assuring the ability of owners of the board's bonds to sell or to have redeemed their bonds. The board may enter into contracts and may agree to pay fees to persons providing such arrangements, including from bond proceeds but only under circumstances in which the total interest paid or to be paid on the bonds, together with the fees for the arrangements (being treated as if interest), would not, taken together, cause the bonds to bear interest, calculated to their absolute maturity, at a rate in excess of the maximum rate allowed by law.
    The resolution of the board authorizing the issuance of its bonds may provide that interest rates may vary from time to time depending upon criteria established by the board, which may include, without limitation, a variation in interest rates as may be necessary to cause bonds to be remarketable from time to time at a price equal to their principal amount, and may provide for appointment of a national banking association, bank, trust company, investment banker or other financial institution to serve as a remarketing agent in that connection. The resolution of the board authorizing the issuance of its bonds may provide that alternative interest rates or provisions will apply during such times as the bonds are held by a person providing a letter of credit or other credit enhancement arrangement for those bonds. The Board may use proceeds of the sale of bonds authorized under this Section to pay the cost of obtaining such municipal bond insurance, letter of credit or other credit facilities. Bonds may also be issued under this Section to pay the cost of refunding any bonds issued under this Section, including prior to their maturity. The bonds shall bear interest at a rate or rates not to exceed the maximum annual rate provided for in Section 2 of "An Act to authorize public corporations to issue bonds, other evidences of indebtedness and tax anticipation warrants subject to interest rate limitations set forth therein", approved May 26, 1970, as now or hereafter amended, and if issued at such maximum annual rate shall be sold for not less than par and accrued interest. If any of the bonds are issued to bear interest at a rate of less than such maximum annual rate the minimum price at which they may be sold shall be such that the interest cost to the board on the proceeds of the bonds shall not exceed such maximum annual rate computed to stated maturity according to standard tables of bond values.
    Whenever the board desires to issue bonds as authorized in this Section, it shall adopt a resolution designating the purpose for which the proceeds of the bonds are to be expended and fixing the amount of the bonds proposed to be issued, the maturity or maturities thereof, and optional provisions, if any, the rate of interest thereon, and the amount of taxes to be levied annually for the purpose of paying the interest upon and the principal, whether due at maturity or upon sinking fund installment dates, of such bonds.
    Said bonds shall be issued in the corporate name of the school district. They shall be signed by the president and secretary of said board and countersigned by the mayor and the comptroller (or city clerk if there be no comptroller) of the city. They shall be sold by the city comptroller (or city clerk if there be no comptroller) upon such terms as may be approved by the board after advertisement for bids as ordered by and under the direction of the board, and the proceeds thereof shall be received by the city treasurer, as school treasurer, and expended by the board for the purposes provided in the bond resolution.
    Before or at the time of issuing any bonds authorized in this Section, the board shall provide for the levy and collection of a direct annual tax upon all the taxable property of such school district sufficient to pay and discharge the principal thereof at maturity, or upon sinking fund installment dates, and to pay the interest thereon as it falls due. Such tax shall be levied and collected in like manner with the other taxes of such school district and shall be in addition to and exclusive of the maximum of all other taxes which such board is now, or may hereafter be, authorized by law to levy for any and all school purposes. Upon the filing in the office of the county clerk of the county wherein such school district is located of a duly certified copy of any such ordinance, it shall be the duty of such county clerk to extend the tax therein provided for, including an amount to cover loss and cost of collecting said taxes and also deferred collections thereof and abatements in the amounts of such taxes as extended upon the collector's books. The ordinance shall be in force upon its passage.

    (a) The board shall establish debt service funds, each to be maintained by a corporate trustee (which may be any trust company or bank having the power of a trust company within the State) separate and segregated from all other funds and accounts of the board, for those issues of obligations of the board for the payment of which a separate tax has been or is to be levied, including, without limitation, a debt service fund for the general obligation bonds of the board, a debt service fund for the general obligation notes of the board and a debt service fund for the lease rentals payable by the board to the Public Building Commission of Chicago. Such funds shall be established for each such outstanding obligation of the board and also for each such obligation as shall be issued by the board after the effective date of this amendatory Act of 1981. The trustee maintaining each such debt service fund shall account separately on its books and records for each such issue of such obligations.
    (b) The city treasurer, as ex officio treasurer of the board, shall, with respect to each collection of taxes levied on behalf of the board, allocate the amounts collected among the issues of such obligations and deliver a report of such allocation to the county collector of each county wherein the board is located. On the basis of such allocation, the county collector shall pay the proceeds of each separate tax levied for the payment of any issue of such obligations upon receipt directly to the corporate trustee maintaining the debt service fund for such obligations for deposit in such debt service fund. In addition, the board shall pay the amount of personal property tax replacement tax revenues applicable to each issue of such obligations upon receipt directly to the corporate trustee maintaining the debt service fund for such obligations for deposit in such debt service fund. Each such deposit shall be held in trust for the benefit of the party or parties to whom payment of such obligations is payable. All such proceeds of such taxes and revenues shall be applied solely for the payment of the related obligations and shall not be used for any other purpose until such obligations are paid in full. Each levy of such taxes shall be for the sole benefit of the party or parties to whom payment of such obligations is payable and such party or parties shall have a security interest in and lien upon all rights, claims and interest of the board arising pursuant to any such levy and all present and future proceeds of such levy until such obligations are paid in full. Such party or parties shall further have a security interest in and lien upon all personal property tax replacement tax revenues upon deposit in the appropriate debt service fund as above provided.
    (c) Any lien or security interest for the benefit of the party or parties to whom any such obligations are payable, made pursuant to this Act, shall be valid and binding from the effective date of the amendatory Act of 1980, and with respect to any obligations issued after the effective date of this amendatory Act of 1981, shall be valid and binding from the date of issue of such obligations, in each case without any physical delivery or further act, and shall be valid and binding as against, and prior to any claims of, all other parties having claims of any kind in tort, contract or otherwise, against the board, irrespective of whether such parties have notice thereof.
    (d) Any monies on deposit in any such debt service fund and not necessary for immediate use may be invested or reinvested in Investment Obligations, as defined in Section 34A-103 of this Act. The board may from time to time withdraw from any such debt service fund, to the extent not prohibited by the resolution of the board authorizing issuance of such obligations, the amount of interest or other investment earnings in such funds but only to the extent that the total amounts in such fund after such withdrawal shall not be less than the requirements for that fund. Any amounts deposited in any such debt service fund not required for payment of principal of or interest on any obligation because that payment has been made or provided for may be withdrawn by the board from the fund at any time, but only to the extent that the total amount in the fund after the withdrawal is not less than the requirements for the fund. The board is not required to make any tax abatement with respect to any such amounts withdrawn or on account of any provision for payment of principal of or interest on obligations. Any amounts so withdrawn by the board may be used for any lawful purpose of the board.

The authority herein granted in paragraphs (a), (b), (c) and (d) shall be considered exclusive of each other and as cumulative authority for the issuance of such bonds.
    With respect to instruments for the payment of money issued under this Section either before, on, or after the effective date of this amendatory Act of 1989, it is and always has been the intention of the General Assembly (i) that the Omnibus Bond Acts are and always have been supplementary grants of power to issue instruments in accordance with the Omnibus Bond Acts, regardless of any provision of this Act that may appear to be or to have been more restrictive than those Acts, (ii) that the provisions of this Section are not a limitation on the supplementary authority granted by the Omnibus Bond Acts, and (iii) that instruments issued under this Section within the supplementary authority granted by the Omnibus Bond Acts are not invalid because of any provision of this Act that may appear to be or to have been more restrictive than those Acts.

All moneys derived from the issuance of bonds under Sections 34-31 and 34-32, or from any tax levied pursuant to Section 34-57 when received by the city treasurer, as school treasurer, shall be set apart in the working cash fund. The moneys in such fund shall not be regarded as current assets available for appropriation and shall not be appropriated by the board in the annual school budget, but in order to provide moneys with which to meet ordinary and necessary disbursements for salaries and other educational purposes may be transferred, in whole or in part, to the educational purposes fund of the board and so disbursed therefrom (a) in anticipation of the collection of any taxes lawfully levied for educational purposes, (b) in anticipation of the receipt of moneys to be derived from the common school fund of the State and from State appropriations, or (c) in anticipation of such taxes, as by law now or hereafter enacted or amended, imposed by the General Assembly of the State of Illinois to replace revenue lost by units of local government and school districts as a result of the abolition of ad valorem personal property taxes, pursuant to Article IX, Section 5(c) of the Constitution of the State of Illinois. Moneys transferred to the educational purposes fund in anticipation of the collection of taxes shall be deemed to have been transferred in anticipation of the collection of that part of the taxes so levied or to be received which is in excess of the amount or amounts thereof required to pay any warrants, and the interest thereon, theretofore or thereafter issued under Sections 34-22 through 34-24, the amount estimated to be required to satisfy debt service and pension or retirement obligations as set forth in Section 12 of "An Act in relation to State revenue sharing with local government entities", approved July 31, 1969, as amended. Such taxes levied for educational purposes when collected shall be applied first to the payment of any such warrants or notes and the interest thereon and the amount estimated to be required to satisfy debt service and pension or retirement obligations, as set forth in Section 12 of "An Act in relation to State revenue sharing with local government entities", approved July 31, 1969, as amended, and then to the reimbursement of the working cash fund as hereinafter provided. Upon the receipt by the city treasurer, as school treasurer, of any taxes or other moneys, in anticipation of the collection or receipt whereof moneys of the working cash fund have been so transferred for disbursement, such fund shall immediately be reimbursed therefrom until the full amount so transferred has been re-transferred to said fund. If taxes in anticipation of the collection of which such transfers are made are not collected in sufficient amounts to effect a complete reimbursement of the working cash fund of the amounts transferred from the working cash fund to the educational purposes fund the deficiencies between the amounts thus transferred and the amounts repaid from collections shall be general obligations of the educational purposes fund until repaid either from taxes in anticipation of which transfers were made or from appropriations which may be made in annual school budgets of sums of money to apply on such general obligations or until repaid from both the taxes in anticipation of which such transfers were made and from appropriations which may be made in annual school budgets of sums of money to apply on such general obligations.

    Sec. 34-35. Resolution for transfer from fund-Amount transferred. Moneys shall be transferred from the working cash fund to the educational purposes fund only upon the authority of the board, which shall by resolution direct the school treasurer to make such transfers. The resolution shall set forth (a) the taxes or other funds in anticipation of the collection or receipt of which the working cash fund is to be reimbursed, (b) the entire amount of taxes extended, or which the board shall estimate will be extended or received, for any year in anticipation of the collection of all or part of which such transfer is to be made, (c) the aggregate amount of warrants or notes theretofore issued in anticipation of the collection of such taxes under the provisions of Sections 34-22 through 34-24 together with the amount of interest accrued and which the board of education estimates will accrue thereon, (d) the amount of moneys which the board of education estimates will be derived for any year from the common school fund of the State and from State appropriations in anticipation of the receipt of all or part of which such transfer is to be made, (e) the aggregate amount of receipts from taxes imposed to replace revenue lost by units of local government and school districts as a result of the abolition of ad valorem personal property taxes, pursuant to Article IX, Section 5(c) of the Constitution of the State of Illinois, which the corporate authorities estimate will be set aside for the payment of the proportionate amount of debt service and pension or retirement obligations, as required by Section 12 of "An Act in relation to State Revenue Sharing with local government entities", approved July 31, 1969, as amended, and (f) the aggregate amount of moneys theretofore transferred from the working cash fund to the educational purposes fund in anticipation of the collection of such taxes or of the receipt of such other moneys from the State. The amount which the resolution shall direct the school treasurer so to transfer in anticipation of the collection of taxes levied or to be received for any year, together with the aggregate amount of such anticipation tax warrants or notes theretofore drawn against such taxes and the amount of the interest accrued and estimated to accrue thereon, the amount estimated to be required to satisfy debt service and pension or retirement obligations, as set forth in Section 12 of "An Act in relation to State revenue sharing with local government entities", approved July 31, 1969, as amended, and the aggregate amount of such transfers theretofore made in anticipation of the collection of such taxes shall not exceed 90% of the actual or estimated amount of such taxes extended or to be extended or to be received as set forth in the resolution. The amount which the resolution shall direct the school treasurer so to transfer in anticipation of the receipt of moneys to be derived for any year from the common school fund of the State or from any State appropriation, together with the aggregate amount theretofore transferred in anticipation of the receipt of any such moneys, shall not exceed the total amount which it is so estimated will be received from such source. When moneys are available in the working cash fund they shall be transferred to the educational purposes fund and disbursed for the payment of salaries and other educational expenses so as to avoid, whenever possible, the issuance of tax anticipation warrants or notes.

    Sec. 34-43.1. (A) Limitation of noninstructional costs. It is the purpose of this Section to establish for the Board of Education and the general superintendent of schools requirements and standards which maximize the proportion of school district resources in direct support of educational, program, and building maintenance and safety services for the pupils of the district, and which correspondingly minimize the amount and proportion of such resources associated with centralized administration, administrative support services, and other noninstructional services.
    For the 1989-90 school year and for all subsequent school years, the Board of Education shall undertake budgetary and expenditure control actions which limit the administrative expenditures of the Board of Education to levels, as provided for in this Section, which represent an average of the administrative expenses of all school districts in this State not subject to Article 34.
    (B) Certification of expenses by the State Superintendent of Education. The State Superintendent of Education shall annually certify, on or before May 1, to the Board of Education and the School Finance Authority, for the applicable school year, the following information:
        (1) the annual expenditures of all school districts
    	
of the State not subject to Article 34 properly attributable to expenditure functions defined by the rules and regulations of the State Board of Education as: 2210 (Improvement of Instructional Services); 2300 (Support Services - General Administration) excluding, however, 2320 (Executive Administrative Services); 2490 (Other Support Services - School Administration); 2500 (Support Services - Business); 2600 (Support Services - Central);
        (2) the total annual expenditures of all school
    	
districts not subject to Article 34 attributable to the Education Fund, the Operations, Building and Maintenance Fund, the Transportation Fund and the Illinois Municipal Retirement Fund of the several districts, as defined by the rules and regulations of the State Board of Education; and
        (3) a ratio, to be called the statewide average of
    	
administrative expenditures, derived by dividing the expenditures certified pursuant to paragraph (B)(1) by the expenditures certified pursuant to paragraph (B)(2).
    For purposes of the annual certification of expenditures and ratios required by this Section, the "applicable year" of certification shall initially be the 1986-87 school year and, in sequent years, each succeeding school year.
    The State Superintendent of Education shall consult with the Board of Education to ascertain whether particular expenditure items allocable to the administrative functions enumerated in paragraph (B)(1) are appropriately or necessarily higher in the applicable school district than in the rest of the State due to noncomparable factors. The State Superintendent shall also review the relevant cost proportions in other large urban school districts. The State Superintendent shall also review the expenditure categories in paragraph (B)(1) to ascertain whether they contain school-level expenses. If he or she finds that adjustments to the formula are appropriate or necessary to establish a more fair and comparable standard for administrative cost for the Board of Education or to exclude school-level expenses, the State Superintendent shall recommend to the School Finance Authority rules and regulations adjusting particular subcategories in this subsection (B) or adjusting certain costs in determining the budget and expenditure items properly attributable to the functions or otherwise adjust the formula.
    (C) Administrative expenditure limitations. The annual budget of the Board of Education, as adopted and implemented, and the related annual expenditures for the school year, shall reflect a limitation on administrative outlays as required by the following provisions, taking into account any adjustments established by the State Superintendent of Education: (1) the budget and expenditures of the Board of Education for the 1989-90 school year shall reflect a ratio of administrative expenditures to total expenditures equal to or less than the statewide average of administrative expenditures for the 1986-87 school year as certified by the State Superintendent of Education pursuant to paragraph (B)(3); (2) for the 1990-91 school year and for all subsequent school years, the budget and expenditures of the Board of Education shall reflect a ratio of administrative expenditures to total expenditures equal to or less than the statewide average of administrative expenditures certified by the State Superintendent of Education for the applicable year pursuant to paragraph (B)(3); (3) if for any school year the budget of the Board of Education reflects a ratio of administrative expenditures to total expenditures which exceeds the applicable statewide average, the Board of Education shall reduce expenditure items allocable to the administrative functions enumerated in paragraph (B)(1) such that the Board of Education's ratio of administrative expenditures to total expenditures is equal to or less than the applicable statewide average ratio.
    For purposes of this Section, the ratio of administrative expenditures to the total expenditures of the Board of Education, as applied to the budget of the Board of Education, shall mean: the budgeted expenditure items of the Board of Education properly attributable to the expenditure functions identified in paragraph (B)(1) divided by the total budgeted expenditures of the Board of Education properly attributable to the Board of Education funds corresponding to those funds identified in paragraph (B)(2), exclusive of any monies budgeted for payment to the Public School Teachers' Pension and Retirement System, attributable to payments due from the General Funds of the State of Illinois.
    The annual expenditure of the Board of Education for 2320 (Executive Administrative Services) for the 1989-90 school year shall be no greater than the 2320 expenditure for the 1988-89 school year. The annual expenditure of the Board of Education for 2320 for the 1990-91 school year and each subsequent school year shall be no greater than the 2320 expenditure for the immediately preceding school year or the 1988-89 school year, whichever is less. This annual expenditure limitation may be adjusted in each year in an amount not to exceed any change effective during the applicable school year in salary to be paid under the collective bargaining agreement with instructional personnel to which the Board is a party and in benefit costs either required by law or such collective bargaining agreement.
    (D) Cost control measures. In undertaking actions to control or reduce expenditure items necessitated by the administrative expenditure limitations of this Section, the Board of Education shall give priority consideration to reductions or cost controls with the least effect upon direct services to students or instructional services for pupils, and upon the safety and well-being of pupils, and, as applicable, with the particular costs or functions to which the Board of Education is higher than the statewide average.
    For purposes of assuring that the cost control priorities of this subsection (D) are met, the State Superintendent of Education shall, with the assistance of the Board of Education, review the cost allocation practices of the Board of Education, and the State Superintendent of Education shall thereafter recommend to the School Finance Authority rules and regulations which define administrative areas which most impact upon the direct and instructional needs of students and upon the safety and well-being of the pupils of the district. No position closed shall be reopened using State or federal categorical funds.
    (E) Report of Audited Information. For the 1988-89 school year and for all subsequent school years, the Board of Education shall file with the State Board of Education the Annual Financial Report and its audit, as required by the rules of the State Board of Education. Such reports shall be filed no later than February 15 following the end of the school year of the Board of Education, beginning with the report to be filed no later than February 15, 1990 for the 1988-89 school year.
    As part of the required Annual Financial Report, the Board of Education shall provide a detailed accounting of the central level, district, bureau and department costs and personnel included within expenditure functions included in paragraph (B)(1). The nature and detail of the reporting required for these functions shall be prescribed by the State Board of Education in rules and regulations. A copy of this detailed accounting shall also be provided annually to the School Finance Authority and the public. This report shall contain a reconciliation to the board of education's adopted budget for that fiscal year, specifically delineating administrative functions.
    If the information required under this Section is not provided by the Board of Education in a timely manner, or is initially or subsequently determined by the State Superintendent of Education to be incomplete or inaccurate, the State Superintendent shall, in writing, notify the Board of Education of reporting deficiencies. The Board of Education shall, within 60 days of such notice, address the reporting deficiencies identified. If the State Superintendent of Education does not receive satisfactory response to these reporting deficiencies within 60 days, the next payment of general State aid or evidence-based funding due the Board of Education under Section 18-8 or Section 18-8.15, as applicable, and all subsequent payments, shall be withheld by the State Superintendent of Education until the enumerated deficiencies have been addressed.
    Utilizing the Annual Financial Report, the State Superintendent of Education shall certify on or before May 1 to the School Finance Authority the Board of Education's ratio of administrative expenditures to total expenditures for the 1988-89 school year and for each succeeding school year. Such certification shall indicate the extent to which the administrative expenditure ratio of the Board of Education conformed to the limitations required in subsection (C) of this Section, taking into account any adjustments of the limitations which may have been recommended by the State Superintendent of Education to the School Finance Authority. In deriving the administrative expenditure ratio of the Chicago Board of Education, the State Superintendent of Education shall utilize the definition of this ratio prescribed in subsection (C) of this Section, except that the actual expenditures of the Board of Education shall be substituted for budgeted expenditure items.
    (F) Approval and adjustments to administrative expenditure limitations. The School Finance Authority organized under Article 34A shall monitor the Board of Education's adherence to the requirements of this Section. As part of its responsibility the School Finance Authority shall determine whether the Board of Education's budget for the next school year, and the expenditures for a prior school year, comply with the limitation of administrative expenditures required by this Section. The Board of Education and the State Board of Education shall provide such information as is required by the School Finance Authority in order for the Authority to determine compliance with the provisions of this Section. If the Authority determines that the budget proposed by the Board of Education does not meet the cost control requirements of this Section, the Board of Education shall undertake budgetary reductions, consistent with the requirements of this Section, to bring the proposed budget into compliance with such cost control limitations.
    If, in formulating cost control and cost reduction alternatives, the Board of Education believes that meeting the cost control requirements of this Section related to the budget for the ensuing year would impair the education, safety, or well-being of the pupils of the school district, the Board of Education may request that the School Finance Authority make adjustments to the limitations required by this Section. The Board of Education shall specify the amount, nature, and reasons for the relief required and shall also identify cost reductions which can be made in expenditure functions not enumerated in paragraph (B)(1), which would serve the purposes of this Section.
    The School Finance Authority shall consult with the State Superintendent of Education concerning the reasonableness from an educational administration perspective of the adjustments sought by the Board of Education. The School Finance Authority shall provide an opportunity for the public to comment upon the reasonableness of the Board's request. If, after such consultation, the School Finance Authority determines that all or a portion of the adjustments sought by the Board of Education are reasonably appropriate or necessary, the Authority may grant such relief from the provisions of this Section which the Authority deems appropriate. Adjustments so granted apply only to the specific school year for which the request was made.
    In the event that the School Finance Authority determines that the Board of Education has failed to achieve the required administrative expenditure limitations for a prior school year, or if the Authority determines that the Board of Education has not met the requirements of subsection (F), the Authority shall make recommendations to the Board of Education concerning appropriate corrective actions. If the Board of Education fails to provide adequate assurance to the Authority that appropriate corrective actions have been or will be taken, the Authority may, within 60 days thereafter, require the board to adjust its current budget to correct for the prior year's shortage or may recommend to the members of the General Assembly and the Governor such sanctions or remedial actions as will serve to deter any further such failures on the part of the Board of Education.
    To assist the Authority in its monitoring responsibilities, the Board of Education shall provide such reports and information as are from time to time required by the Authority.
    (G) Independent reviews of administrative expenditures. The School Finance Authority may direct independent reviews of the administrative and administrative support expenditures and services and other non-instructional expenditure functions of the Board of Education. The Board of Education shall afford full cooperation to the School Finance Authority in such review activity. The purpose of such reviews shall be to verify specific targets for improved operating efficiencies of the Board of Education, to identify other areas of potential efficiencies, and to assure full and proper compliance by the Board of Education with all requirements of this Section.
    In the conduct of reviews under this subsection, the Authority may request the assistance and consultation of the State Superintendent of Education with regard to questions of efficiency and effectiveness in educational administration.
    (H) Reports to Governor and General Assembly. On or before May 1, 1991 and no less frequently than yearly thereafter, the School Finance Authority shall provide to the Governor, the State Board of Education, and the members of the General Assembly an annual report, as outlined in Section 34A-606, which includes the following information: (1) documenting the compliance or non-compliance of the Board of Education with the requirements of this Section; (2) summarizing the costs, findings, and recommendations of any reviews directed by the School Finance Authority, and the response to such recommendations made by the Board of Education; and (3) recommending sanctions or legislation necessary to fulfill the intent of this Section.

    Sec. 34-44. Budget estimates. The budget shall set forth estimates, by classes, of all current assets and liabilities of each fund of the board as of the beginning of the fiscal year, and the amounts of such assets estimated to be available for appropriation in such year, either for expenditures or charges to be made or incurred during such year or for liabilities unpaid at the beginning thereof. Estimates of taxes to be received from prior levies shall be net, after deducting amounts estimated to be sufficient to cover the loss and cost of collecting such taxes and also deferred collections thereof and abatements in the amount of such taxes extended or to be extended upon the collectors' books.
    Estimates of the liabilities of the respective funds shall include:
    1. All final judgments, including accrued interest thereon, entered against the board and unpaid at the beginning of such fiscal year;
    2. The principal of all general obligation notes or anticipation tax warrants and all temporary loans and all accrued interest thereon unpaid at the beginning of such fiscal year;
    3. Any amount for which the board is required to reimburse the working cash fund from the educational purposes fund pursuant to the provisions of Section 34-30 through 34-36 and
    4. The amount of all accounts payable including estimates of audited vouchers, participation certificates, inter fund loans and purchase orders payable.
    The budget shall also set forth detailed estimates of all accrued tax revenues recognized for such year and of all current revenues to be derived from sources other than taxes, including State contributions, rents, fees, perquisites and all other types of revenue, which will be applicable to expenditures or charges to be made or incurred during such year.
    All such estimates shall be so segregated and classified as to funds, and in such other manner as to give effect to the requirements of law relating to the respective purposes to which the assets and taxes and other current revenues are applicable, so that no expenditure shall be authorized or made for any purpose in excess of the money lawfully available therefor.
    The several estimates of assets, liabilities and expenditure requirements required or authorized to be made by this and the next succeeding section shall be made on the basis of information known to the board at the close of the preceding fiscal year and shall not be invalidated or otherwise subject to attack merely because after that time additional information is known to or could be discovered by the board that would require a different estimate, or because the board might have amended such estimates under any of the provisions of Section 34-47.

When the value of the taxable property in the school district is increased either by the establishment of a new multiplier by the Department of Revenue or the availability of a later assessment by virtue of additions to the tax rolls or increases in assessments made by the county assessor after the annual school budget has been adopted, the board of education may adopt, by a 2/3 vote of the full membership of the board, a supplemental budget to provide for the use of the added potential revenues in an amount that shall not exceed a sum equivalent to the product of the amount of the increase in the value of taxable property in the district multiplied by the maximum per cent or rate of tax which the board and the corporate authorities of the city are authorized by law to levy for the current fiscal year for educational, building, free textbook, agricultural science school, supervised playground outside school hours purposes (or supervised playground outside school hours and stadia, social center and summer swimming pool open to the public purposes, as the case may be) or special education purposes. With respect to any supplemental budget based upon an increase in the value of the taxable property in the school district, such supplemental budget shall be adopted within 60 days of the date of the final certification of the equalization rate by the Department of Revenue to the county clerk as provided in the Property Tax Code, regardless of whether the adoption occurs within or after the close of the fiscal year to which the increase applies, but shall not become effective unless approved in accordance with Article 34A of "The School Code".

    Sec. 34-49. Contracts, expense and liabilities without appropriation. No contract shall be made or expense or liability incurred by the board, or any member or committee thereof, or by any person for or in its behalf, notwithstanding the expenditure may have been ordered by the board, unless an appropriation therefor has been previously made. Neither the board, nor any member or committee, officer, head of any department or bureau, or employee thereof shall during a fiscal year expend or contract to be expended any money, or incur any liability, or enter into any contract which by its terms involves the expenditure of money for any of the purposes for which provision is made in the budget, in excess of the amounts appropriated in the budget. Any contract, verbal or written, made in violation of this Section is void as to the board, and no moneys belonging thereto shall be paid thereon. Provided, however, that the board may lease from any Public Building Commission created pursuant to the provisions of the Public Building Commission Act, approved July 5, 1955, as heretofore or hereafter amended, or from any individuals, partnerships or corporations, any real or personal property for the purpose of securing space for its school purposes or office or other space for its administrative functions for any period of time not exceeding 40 years, and such lease may be made and the obligation or expense thereunder incurred without making a previous appropriation therefor, except as otherwise provided in Section 34-21.1 of this Act. Provided that the board may enter into agreements, including lease and lease purchase agreements having a term not longer than 40 years from the date on which such agreements are entered into, with individuals, partnerships, or corporations for the construction of school buildings, school administrative offices, site development, and school support facilities. The board shall maintain exclusive possession of all such schools, school administrative offices, and school facilities which it is occupying or acquiring pursuant to any such lease or lease purchase agreement, and in addition shall have and exercise complete control over the education program conducted at such schools, offices and facilities. The board's contribution under any such lease or lease purchase agreement shall be limited to the use of the real estate and existing improvements on a rental basis which shall be exempt from any form of leasehold tax or assessment, but the interests of the board may be subordinated to the interests of a mortgage holder or holders acquired as security for additional improvements made on the property. Provided that the board may enter into agreements, including lease and lease purchase agreements, having a term not longer than 40 years from the date on which such agreements are entered into for the provision of school buildings and related property and facilities for an agricultural science school pursuant to subparagraphs (8) through (10) of Section 34-21.1; and such agreements may be made and the obligations thereunder incurred without making a previous appropriation therefor. This Section does not prevent the making of lawful contracts for the construction of buildings, the purchase of insurance, the leasing of equipment, the purchase of personal property by a conditional sales agreement, or the leasing of personal property under an agreement that upon compliance with the terms of which the board shall become or has the option to become the owner of the property for no additional consideration or for a nominal consideration, the term of which may be for periods of more than 1 year, but, in no case, shall such conditional sales agreements or leases of personal property by which the board may or will become the owner of the personal property, provide for the consideration to be paid during a period of time in excess of 10 years nor shall such contracts provide for the payment of interest in excess of the maximum rate authorized by the Bond Authorization Act, as amended at the time of the making of the contract, on the unpaid balance owing; nor shall this Section prevent the making of lawful contracts for the purchase of fuel and the removal of ashes for a period from July 1 of any year to June 30 of the year following, or the making of lawful contracts for the transportation of pupils to and from school, or the entering into of employment contracts with individuals or groups of employees for any period not to exceed 4 years, or the entering into contracts with third parties for services otherwise performed by employees for any period not to exceed 5 years provided that the contracts with third parties for services provided at attendance centers shall specify that the principal of an attendance center shall have authority, to the maximum extent possible, to direct persons assigned to the attendance center pursuant to that contract, or the making of requirement contracts for not to exceed one year the terms of which may extend into the succeeding fiscal year provided, however, that such contracts contain a limitation on the amount to be expended and that such contracts shall impose no obligation on the board except pursuant to written purchase order.
    With respect to instruments for the payment of money issued under this Section either before, on, or after the effective date of this amendatory Act of 1989, it is and always has been the intention of the General Assembly (i) that the Omnibus Bond Acts are and always have been supplementary grants of power to issue instruments in accordance with the Omnibus Bond Acts, regardless of any provision of this Act that may appear to be or to have been more restrictive than those Acts, (ii) that the provisions of this Section are not a limitation on the supplementary authority granted by the Omnibus Bond Acts, and (iii) that instruments issued under this Section within the supplementary authority granted by the Omnibus Bond Acts are not invalid because of any provision of this Act that may appear to be or to have been more restrictive than those Acts.

    Beginning on the effective date of this amendatory Act of the 99th General Assembly, for the purpose of making an employer contribution to the Public School Teachers' Pension and Retirement Fund of Chicago, the board may levy annually for taxable years prior to 2017, upon all taxable property located within the district, a tax at a rate not to exceed 0.383%. Beginning with the 2017 taxable year, for the purpose of making an employer contribution to the Public School Teachers' Pension and Retirement Fund of Chicago, the board may levy annually, upon all taxable property within the district, a tax at a rate not to exceed 0.567%. The proceeds from this additional tax shall be paid, as soon as possible after collection, directly to Public School Teachers' Pension and Retirement Fund of Chicago and not to the Board of Education. The rate under this paragraph is not a new rate for the purposes of the Property Tax Extension Limitation Law. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, for the 2016 tax year only, the board shall certify the rate to the county clerk on the effective date of this amendatory Act of the 99th General Assembly, and the county clerk shall extend that rate against all taxable property located within the district as soon after receiving the certification as possible.
    Nothing in this amendatory Act of 1995 shall in any way impair or restrict the levy or extension of taxes pursuant to any tax levies for any purposes of the board lawfully made prior to the adoption of this amendatory Act of 1995.
    Notwithstanding any other provision of this Code and in addition to any other methods provided for increasing the tax rate the board may, by proper resolution, cause a proposition to increase the annual tax rate for educational purposes to be submitted to the voters of such district at any general or special election. The maximum rate for educational purposes shall not exceed 4.00%. The election called for such purpose shall be governed by Article 9 of this Act. If at such election a majority of the votes cast on the proposition is in favor thereof, the Board of Education may thereafter until such authority is revoked in a like manner, levy annually the tax so authorized.
    For purposes of this Article, educational purposes for fiscal years beginning in 1995 and each subsequent year shall also include, but not be limited to, in addition to those purposes authorized before this amendatory Act of 1995, constructing, acquiring, leasing (other than from the Public Building Commission of Chicago), operating, maintaining, improving, repairing, and renovating land, buildings, furnishings, and equipment for school houses and buildings, and related incidental expenses, and provision of special education, furnishing free textbooks and instructional aids and school supplies, establishing, equipping, maintaining, and operating supervised playgrounds under the control of the board, school extracurricular activities, and stadia, social center, and summer swimming pool programs open to the public in connection with any public school; making an employer contribution to the Public School Teachers' Pension and Retirement Fund as required by Section 17-129 of the Illinois Pension Code; and providing an agricultural science school, including site development and improvements, maintenance repairs, and supplies. Educational purposes also includes student transportation expenses.

The levy and extension of taxes pursuant to this Section as amended by this amendatory Act of 1995 shall not constitute a new or increased tax rate within the meaning of the Property Tax Extension Limitation Law or the One-year Property Tax Extension Limitation Law.
    The rate at which taxes may be levied for the fiscal year beginning September 1, 1996, for educational purposes shall be the full rate authorized by this Section for such taxes for fiscal years ending after 1995.

The levy may be based upon the estimated equalized assessed valuation provided the county clerk shall extend for collection only so much thereof as is permitted by law. The total amount of the levy shall be certified to the county clerk who shall extend for collection only so much thereof as is required to provide the necessary revenue to defray expenditures, charges and liabilities incurred by the board as certified by the controller of the board to the county clerk upon the value, as equalized or assessed by the Department of Revenue for the calendar year in which the levy was made. The county clerk shall thereafter in the succeeding calendar year extend such remaining amount of the levy as is certified by the controller of the board to the county clerk upon the value, as equalized or assessed by the Department of Revenue for such calendar year. In each year the county clerk shall extend taxes at a rate sufficient to produce the full amount of the 2 partial levies attributable to that tax year.

Taxes levied pursuant to this paragraph (b) shall be in addition to all other taxes which have been or may be levied by or for the board, except that the extension of taxes levied pursuant to this paragraph (b), to the extent valid and legal in all respects, shall be an abatement of the same amount of taxes previously purported to be levied by the board which were to have been extended in the same year for the same purpose, it being the intention of the General Assembly that there not be extended duplicate taxes for the same year and purpose. It shall not be necessary that the board give any notice or conduct any hearings for any purpose whatsoever or to have adopted any proceedings with respect to any budget, in connection with the levy and extension of taxes pursuant to this paragraph (b).

The State Board of Education in consultation with the board of examiners and the State Teacher Certification Board shall develop procedures whereby teachers currently holding valid certificates issued by the board of examiners, and all teachers employed by the board after August 1, 1985 and prior to July 1, 1988, shall no later than July 1, 1988 exchange certificates issued by the board of examiners for comparable certificates issued by the State Teacher Certification Board. On the exchange of a certificate on or before July 1, 1988, the State Teacher Certification Board shall not require any additional qualifications for the issuance of the comparable certificate. If prior to July 1, 1988 the board of examiners has issued types of teaching certificates which are not comparable to the types of certificates issued by the State Teacher Certification Board, such certificates shall continue to be valid for and shall be renewable by the holders thereof, and no additional qualifications shall be required by the State Teacher Certification Board for any such renewal; however, no individual who received a letter of continuing eligibility shall be issued an Initial or Standard Teaching Certificate, as provided in Section 21-2 of this Code, unless that individual also holds such a valid and renewable certificate.
    The State Board of Education shall report by July 1, 1986, to the Illinois General Assembly on the procedures for exchange it has developed in consultation with the board of examiners and the State Teacher Certification Board as required in this Section.

    (105 ILCS 5/34-85) (from Ch. 122, par. 34-85)
    Sec. 34-85. Removal for cause; notice and hearing; suspension.
    (a) No teacher employed by the board of education shall (after serving the probationary period specified in Section 34-84) be removed except for cause. Teachers (who have completed the probationary period specified in Section 34-84 of this Code) shall be removed for cause in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section or, at the board's option, the procedures set forth in Section 24-16.5 of this Code or such other procedures established in an agreement entered into between the board and the exclusive representative of the district's teachers under Section 34-85c of this Code for teachers (who have completed the probationary period specified in Section 34-84 of this Code) assigned to schools identified in that agreement. No principal employed by the board of education shall be removed during the term of his or her performance contract except for cause, which may include but is not limited to the principal's repeated failure to implement the school improvement plan or to comply with the provisions of the Uniform Performance Contract, including additional criteria established by the Council for inclusion in the performance contract pursuant to Section 34-2.3.
    Before service of notice of charges on account of causes that may be deemed to be remediable, the teacher or principal must be given reasonable warning in writing, stating specifically the causes that, if not removed, may result in charges; however, no such written warning is required if the causes have been the subject of a remediation plan pursuant to Article 24A of this Code or if the board and the exclusive representative of the district's teachers have entered into an agreement pursuant to Section 34-85c of this Code, pursuant to an alternative system of remediation. No written warning shall be required for conduct on the part of a teacher or principal that is cruel, immoral, negligent, or criminal or that in any way causes psychological or physical harm or injury to a student, as that conduct is deemed to be irremediable. No written warning shall be required for a material breach of the uniform principal performance contract, as that conduct is deemed to be irremediable; provided that not less than 30 days before the vote of the local school council to seek the dismissal of a principal for a material breach of a uniform principal performance contract, the local school council shall specify the nature of the alleged breach in writing and provide a copy of it to the principal.
        (1) To initiate dismissal proceedings against a
    	
teacher or principal, the general superintendent must first approve written charges and specifications against the teacher or principal. A local school council may direct the general superintendent to approve written charges against its principal on behalf of the Council upon the vote of 7 members of the Council. The general superintendent must approve those charges within 45 calendar days or provide a written reason for not approving those charges. A written notice of those charges, including specifications, shall be served upon the teacher or principal within 10 business days of the approval of the charges. Any written notice sent on or after July 1, 2012 shall also inform the teacher or principal of the right to request a hearing before a mutually selected hearing officer, with the cost of the hearing officer split equally between the teacher or principal and the board, or a hearing before a qualified hearing officer chosen by the general superintendent, with the cost of the hearing officer paid by the board. If the teacher or principal cannot be found upon diligent inquiry, such charges may be served upon him by mailing a copy thereof in a sealed envelope by prepaid certified mail, return receipt requested, to the teacher's or principal's last known address. A return receipt showing delivery to such address within 20 calendar days after the date of the approval of the charges shall constitute proof of service.
        (2) No hearing upon the charges is required unless
    	
the teacher or principal within 17 calendar days after receiving notice requests in writing of the general superintendent that a hearing be scheduled. Pending the hearing of the charges, the general superintendent or his or her designee may suspend the teacher or principal charged without pay in accordance with rules prescribed by the board, provided that if the teacher or principal charged is not dismissed based on the charges, he or she must be made whole for lost earnings, less setoffs for mitigation.
        (3) The board shall maintain a list of at least 9
    	
qualified hearing officers who will conduct hearings on charges and specifications. The list must be developed in good faith consultation with the exclusive representative of the board's teachers and professional associations that represent the board's principals. The list may be revised on July 1st of each year or earlier as needed. To be a qualified hearing officer, the person must (i) be accredited by a national arbitration organization and have had a minimum of 5 years of experience as an arbitrator in cases involving labor and employment relations matters between employers and employees or their exclusive bargaining representatives and (ii) beginning September 1, 2012, have participated in training provided or approved by the State Board of Education for teacher dismissal hearing officers so that he or she is familiar with issues generally involved in evaluative and non-evaluative dismissals.
        Within 5 business days after receiving the notice of
    	
request for a hearing, the general superintendent and the teacher or principal or their legal representatives shall alternately strike one name from the list until only one name remains. Unless waived by the teacher, the teacher or principal shall have the right to proceed first with the striking. If the teacher or principal fails to participate in the striking process, the general superintendent shall either select the hearing officer from the list developed pursuant to this paragraph (3) or select another qualified hearing officer from the master list maintained by the State Board of Education pursuant to subsection (c) of Section 24-12 of this Code.
        (4) If the notice of dismissal was sent to the
    	
teacher or principal before July 1, 2012, the fees and costs for the hearing officer shall be paid by the State Board of Education. If the notice of dismissal was sent to the teacher or principal on or after July 1, 2012, the hearing officer's fees and costs must be paid as follows in this paragraph (4). The fees and permissible costs for the hearing officer shall be determined by the State Board of Education. If the hearing officer is mutually selected by the parties through alternate striking in accordance with paragraph (3) of this subsection (a), then the board and the teacher or their legal representative shall each pay 50% of the fees and costs and any supplemental allowance to which they agree. If the hearing officer is selected by the general superintendent without the participation of the teacher or principal, then the board shall pay 100% of the hearing officer fees and costs. The hearing officer shall submit for payment a billing statement to the parties that itemizes the charges and expenses and divides them in accordance with this Section.
        (5) The teacher or the principal charged is required
    	
to answer the charges and specifications and aver affirmative matters in his or her defense, and the time for doing so must be set by the hearing officer. The State Board of Education shall adopt rules so that each party has a fair opportunity to present its case and to ensure that the dismissal proceeding is concluded in an expeditious manner. The rules shall address, without limitation, the teacher or principal's answer and affirmative defenses to the charges and specifications; a requirement that each party make mandatory disclosures without request to the other party and then update the disclosure no later than 10 calendar days prior to the commencement of the hearing, including a list of the names and addresses of persons who may be called as witnesses at the hearing, a summary of the facts or opinions each witness will testify to, and all other documents and materials, including information maintained electronically, relevant to its own as well as the other party's case (the hearing officer may exclude witnesses and exhibits not identified and shared, except those offered in rebuttal for which the party could not reasonably have anticipated prior to the hearing); pre-hearing discovery and preparation, including provision for written interrogatories and requests for production of documents, provided that discovery depositions are prohibited; the conduct of the hearing; the right of each party to be represented by counsel, the offer of evidence and witnesses and the cross-examination of witnesses; the authority of the hearing officer to issue subpoenas and subpoenas duces tecum, provided that the hearing officer may limit the number of witnesses to be subpoenaed in behalf of each party to no more than 7; the length of post-hearing briefs; and the form, length, and content of hearing officers' reports and recommendations to the general superintendent.
        The hearing officer shall commence the hearing within
    	
75 calendar days and conclude the hearing within 120 calendar days after being selected by the parties as the hearing officer, provided that these timelines may be modified upon the showing of good cause or mutual agreement of the parties. Good cause for the purposes of this paragraph (5) shall mean the illness or otherwise unavoidable emergency of the teacher, district representative, their legal representatives, the hearing officer, or an essential witness as indicated in each party's pre-hearing submission. In a dismissal hearing in which a witness is a student or is under the age of 18, the hearing officer must make accommodations for the witness, as provided under paragraph (5.5) of this subsection. The hearing officer shall consider and give weight to all of the teacher's evaluations written pursuant to Article 24A that are relevant to the issues in the hearing. Except as otherwise provided under paragraph (5.5) of this subsection, the teacher or principal has the privilege of being present at the hearing with counsel and of cross-examining witnesses and may offer evidence and witnesses and present defenses to the charges. Each party shall have no more than 3 days to present its case, unless extended by the hearing officer to enable a party to present adequate evidence and testimony, including due to the other party's cross-examination of the party's witnesses, for good cause or by mutual agreement of the parties. The State Board of Education shall define in rules the meaning of "day" for such purposes. All testimony at the hearing shall be taken under oath administered by the hearing officer. The hearing officer shall cause a record of the proceedings to be kept and shall employ a competent reporter to take stenographic or stenotype notes of all the testimony. The costs of the reporter's attendance and services at the hearing shall be paid by the party or parties who are paying the fees and costs of the hearing officer. Either party desiring a transcript of the hearing shall pay for the cost thereof. At the close of the hearing, the hearing officer shall direct the parties to submit post-hearing briefs no later than 21 calendar days after receipt of the transcript. Either or both parties may waive submission of briefs.
        (5.5) In the case of charges involving sexual abuse
    	
or severe physical abuse of a student or a person under the age of 18, the hearing officer shall make alternative hearing procedures to protect a witness who is a student or who is under the age of 18 from being intimidated or traumatized. Alternative hearing procedures may include, but are not limited to: (i) testimony made via a telecommunication device in a location other than the hearing room and outside the physical presence of the teacher or principal and other hearing participants, (ii) testimony outside the physical presence of the teacher or principal, or (iii) non-public testimony. During a testimony described under this subsection, each party must be permitted to ask a witness who is a student or who is under 18 years of age all relevant questions and follow-up questions. All questions must exclude evidence of the witness' sexual behavior or predisposition, unless the evidence is offered to prove that someone other than the teacher subject to the dismissal hearing engaged in the charge at issue.
        (6) The hearing officer shall within 30 calendar days
    	
from the conclusion of the hearing report to the general superintendent findings of fact and a recommendation as to whether or not the teacher or principal shall be dismissed and shall give a copy of the report to both the teacher or principal and the general superintendent. The State Board of Education shall provide by rule the form of the hearing officer's report and recommendation.
        (7) The board, within 45 days of receipt of the
    	
hearing officer's findings of fact and recommendation, shall make a decision as to whether the teacher or principal shall be dismissed from its employ. The failure of the board to strictly adhere to the timeliness contained herein shall not render it without jurisdiction to dismiss the teacher or principal. In the event that the board declines to dismiss the teacher or principal after review of a hearing officer's recommendation, the board shall set the amount of back pay and benefits to award the teacher or principal, which shall include offsets for interim earnings and failure to mitigate losses. The board shall establish procedures for the teacher's or principal's submission of evidence to it regarding lost earnings, lost benefits, mitigation, and offsets. The decision of the board is final unless reviewed in accordance with paragraph (8) of this subsection (a).
        (8) The teacher may seek judicial review of the
    	
board's decision in accordance with the Administrative Review Law, which is specifically incorporated in this Section, except that the review must be initiated in the Illinois Appellate Court for the First District. In the event judicial review is instituted, any costs of preparing and filing the record of proceedings shall be paid by the party instituting the review. In the event the appellate court reverses a board decision to dismiss a teacher or principal and directs the board to pay the teacher or the principal back pay and benefits, the appellate court shall remand the matter to the board to issue an administrative decision as to the amount of back pay and benefits, which shall include a calculation of the lost earnings, lost benefits, mitigation, and offsets based on evidence submitted to the board in accordance with procedures established by the board.
        (9) If the Governor has declared a disaster due to a
    	
public health emergency pursuant to Section 7 of the Illinois Emergency Management Act, except if the parties mutually agree otherwise and the agreement is in writing, the requirements of this Section pertaining to prehearings and hearings are paused and do not begin to toll until the proclamation declaring the disaster is no longer in effect. If mutually agreed to and reduced in writing, the parties may proceed with the prehearing and hearing requirements of this Section connected to the appointment and selection of a hearing officer and those connected to commencing and concluding a hearing. Any hearing convened during a public health emergency pursuant to Section 7 of the Illinois Emergency Management Agency Act may be convened remotely. Any hearing officer for a hearing convened during a public health emergency pursuant to Section 7 of the Illinois Emergency Management Agency Act may voluntarily withdraw from the hearing and another hearing officer shall be selected or appointed pursuant to this Section.
    (b) Nothing in this Section affects the validity of removal for cause hearings commenced prior to June 13, 2011 (the effective date of Public Act 97-8).
    The changes made by Public Act 97-8 shall apply to dismissals instituted on or after September 1, 2011 or the effective date of Public Act 97-8, whichever is later. Any dismissal instituted prior to the effective date of these changes must be carried out in accordance with the requirements of this Section prior to amendment by Public Act 97-8.

    (a) Notwithstanding any law to the contrary, the board and the exclusive representative of the district's teachers are hereby authorized to enter into an agreement to establish alternative procedures for teacher evaluation, remediation, and removal for cause after remediation, including an alternative system for peer evaluation and recommendations; provided, however, that no later than September 1, 2012: (i) any alternative procedures must include provisions whereby student performance data is a significant factor in teacher evaluation and (ii) teachers are rated as "excellent", "proficient", "needs improvement" or "unsatisfactory". Pursuant exclusively to that agreement, teachers assigned to schools identified in that agreement shall be subject to an alternative performance evaluation plan and remediation procedures in lieu of the plan and procedures set forth in Article 24A of this Code and alternative removal for cause standards and procedures in lieu of the removal standards and procedures set forth in Section 34-85 of this Code. To the extent that the agreement provides a teacher with an opportunity for a hearing on removal for cause before an independent hearing officer in accordance with Section 34-85 or otherwise, the hearing officer shall be governed by the alternative performance evaluation plan, remediation procedures, and removal standards and procedures set forth in the agreement in making findings of fact and a recommendation.
    (a-5) If the Governor has declared a disaster due to a public health emergency pursuant to Section 7 of the Illinois Emergency Management Agency Act that suspends in-person instruction, the timelines connected to the commencement and completion of any remediation plan are paused. Except where the parties mutually agree otherwise and such agreement is in writing, any remediation plan that had been in place for 45 or more days prior to the suspension of in-person instruction shall resume when in-person instruction resumes; any remediation plan that had been in place for fewer than 45 days prior to the suspension of in-person instruction shall discontinue and a new remediation period will begin when in-person instruction resumes.
    (b) The board and the exclusive representative of the district's teachers shall submit a certified copy of an agreement as provided under subsection (a) of this Section to the State Board of Education.

    (a) The General Assembly finds:
        (i) A fundamental goal of the people of the State, as
    	
expressed in Section 1 of Article X of the Illinois Constitution, is the educational development of all persons to the limits of their capacities. When a board of education faces financial difficulties, continued operation of the public school system is threatened.
        (ii) A sound financial structure is essential to the
    	
continued operation of any school system. It is vital to commercial, educational and cultural interests that the public schools remain in operation. To achieve that goal, public school systems must have effective access to the private market to borrow short and long term funds.
        (iii) To promote the financial integrity of boards of
    	
education of cities having a population exceeding 500,000, it is necessary to provide for the creation of school finance authorities with the powers necessary to promote sound financial management and to assure the continued operation of the public schools.
    (b) It is the purpose of this Article to provide a secure financial basis for the continued operation of the public schools. In addition, it is the further purpose of this Article to facilitate implementation of school reform in the continued operation of the public schools in accordance with the provisions of this amendatory Act of 1991. The intention of the General Assembly, in enacting this legislation, is to establish procedures, provide powers and impose restrictions to assure the financial and educational integrity of the public schools while leaving principal responsibility for the educational policies of the public schools to the boards of education within the State, consistent with the requirements for satisfying the public policy and purpose herein set forth.

    Sec. 34A-501. Power to issue Bonds.
    (a) The Authority may incur indebtedness by the issuance of its negotiable full faith and credit general obligation bonds (the "Bonds") in an amount not to exceed at any time the sum of $695,000,000 (excluding Bonds to be issued to refund outstanding Bonds) for the purpose of providing the Board with moneys for ordinary and necessary expenditures for educational purposes, maintenance of school facilities, and other operational needs of the Board; payment of outstanding debt obligations of the Board and of the City, the proceeds of which were used to provide financing for the Board; providing or increasing a working cash fund as provided by paragraph (d) of this Section 34A-501; providing the Board with moneys for school construction and rehabilitation purposes as provided by paragraph (e) of this Section; payment of fees for arrangements as provided by paragraph (c) of Section 34A-502; payment of interest on Bonds; establishment of reserves to secure Bonds; the payment of costs of issuance of Bonds; payment of principal of or interest or redemption premium on any Bonds or notes of the Authority; and all other expenditures of the Authority incidental to and necessary or convenient for carrying out its corporate purposes and powers, and in an additional amount not to exceed at any time the sum of $427,000,000 (excluding Bonds to be issued to refund outstanding Bonds) for the purpose of providing the Board with moneys for ordinary and necessary expenditures for educational purposes, maintenance of school facilities, and other operational needs of the Board; payment of fees for arrangements as provided by paragraph (c) of Section 34A-502; payment in connection with agreements or contracts entered into as provided for in Section 7 of the Bond Authorization Act; payment of interest on Bonds; establishment of reserves to secure Bonds; the payment of costs of issuance of Bonds; payment of principal of or interest or redemption premium on any Bonds or notes of the Authority; and all other expenditures of the Authority incidental to and necessary or convenient for carrying out its corporate purposes and powers. No more than $40,000,000 of proceeds of Bonds of the Authority shall be deposited in a working cash fund as provided by paragraph (d) of this Section 34A-501. No more than $95,000,000 of proceeds of Bonds of the Authority shall be provided to the Board for school construction and rehabilitation purposes; provided that not less than $32,000,000 nor more than $37,000,000 of such proceeds shall be used by the Board for constructing new school buildings or providing additions to school buildings.
    (b) The Authority may from time to time (i) issue Bonds to refund any outstanding Bonds or notes of the Authority whether the Bonds or notes to be refunded have or have not matured or become redeemable and (ii) issue Bonds partly to refund Bonds or notes then outstanding and partly for any other purpose hereinabove set forth.
    (c) Bonds issued in accordance with paragraph (a) of this Section may be issued in excess of any statutory limitation as to debt, and may be issued without referendum.
    (d) The Authority may create a working cash fund to provide working cash for the Board. Amounts in the working cash fund shall be used by the Authority to make loans from time to time to the Board to enable the Board to cover anticipated cash flow deficiencies which it may experience within the fiscal year of the Board in which the loan is made, all as and to the extent determined by the Authority. The loans shall be made in such amounts and upon such terms as the Board and the Authority shall agree. The Authority shall not under any circumstance be obligated to make any such loan. No interest need be charged on any such loan. The Board may pledge and assign to the repayment of such loans and may apply to that repayment any particular receipts of the Board which have not been pledged to the payment of any of the Board's bonds, notes, tax anticipation warrants or state aid anticipation certificates. Each loan shall be required to be repaid in full by the Board within the fiscal year of the Board in which the loan was made and, in any event, within 11 months from the date on which it was made. Interest and other investment earnings on the working cash fund shall be deposited in and shall be part of that fund. Whenever the Authority shall determine that all or part of the working cash fund is no longer needed for making loans to the Board as provided in this paragraph, the Authority shall reduce the amount of the fund so that the amount in the fund does not exceed the amount which the Authority determines is necessary for use for making future loans to the Board as provided in this paragraph. Upon any such reduction in the amount of the working cash fund and upon its abolition, all amounts in excess of the amounts to remain in the fund shall be deposited in the debt service fund established by the Authority for the Bonds for use for paying principal of Bonds at their maturity or on earlier redemption dates, redemption premium and any interest accruing on those Bonds, all as the Authority shall determine and direct.
    (e) For purposes of this Section, "school construction and rehabilitation purposes" means constructing new school buildings and rehabilitating and accomplishing the deferred maintenance existing as of August 31, 1984, of school buildings, including, without limitation, repairing, modernizing, providing additions to and facilities in, altering and reconstructing school buildings and equipment.
    Any interest or other investment earnings on proceeds of Bonds issued for the purpose of providing the Board with moneys for school construction and rehabilitation purposes shall be applied as provided in the resolution authorizing such Bonds, which resolution shall require those earnings to be used for the same purpose as the proceeds of those Bonds or for the payment of principal of or interest or redemption premium on any Bonds, either at maturity or an earlier redemption date. Application by the Authority of any proceeds of Bonds issued for the purpose of providing the Board with moneys for school construction and rehabilitation purposes, or interest or other investment earnings thereon, shall be in the sole judgment and discretion of the Authority, but no such moneys shall be so provided unless the Authority shall have found and determined, in its sole judgment and discretion, that such moneys are to be used for those purposes and not for providing the Board with moneys for its ordinary and necessary expenditures for educational purposes, maintenance of school facilities or other operational needs. The Authority may, in making its findings and determinations, rely upon information provided by or on behalf of the Board. The Authority may from time to time make and amend regulations and issue directives with respect to the use and application of such moneys.
    The Authority may, at any time, in its sole judgment and discretion, deposit unexpended proceeds of Bonds issued for the purpose of providing the Board with moneys for school construction and rehabilitation purposes or interest or other investment earnings thereon solely in a debt service fund for any Bonds and shall apply such moneys to the payment of principal of or interest or redemption premium on Bonds, at maturity or an earlier redemption date. In the resolution authorizing Bonds, the Authority may make commitments or covenants to holders of Bonds with respect to such use of such unexpended proceeds and interest or other investment earnings.

    (a) Whenever the Authority desires or is required to issue Bonds as provided in this Article, it shall adopt a resolution designating the amount of the Bonds to be issued, the purposes for which the proceeds of the Bonds are to be used and the manner in which such proceeds shall be held pending the application thereof. The Bonds shall be issued in the corporate name of the Authority, shall bear such date or dates, and shall mature at such time or times not exceeding 30 years from their date as such resolution may provide; provided, however, that Bonds issued on or after July 1, 1993 shall mature on or before June 1, 2009. The Bonds may be issued as serial bonds payable in installments or as term bonds with sinking fund installments or as a combination thereof as the Authority may determine in such resolution. The Bonds shall be in such denominations of $1,000 or integral multiples thereof. The Bonds shall be in such form, either coupon or registered, carry such registration privileges, be executed in such manner, be payable at such place or places and be subject to such terms of redemption at such redemption prices, including premium, as such resolution may provide. The Bonds shall be sold by the Authority at public sale. The Bonds shall be sold to the highest and best bidders upon sealed bids. The Authority shall, from time to time as Bonds are to be sold, advertise in at least 2 daily newspapers, one of which is published in the City of Springfield and one in the City of Chicago, for proposals to purchase Bonds. Each of such advertisements for proposals shall be published at least ten days prior to the date of the opening of the bids. The Authority may reserve the right to reject any and all bids.
    (b) Bonds issued prior to December 31, 1980 shall bear interest at such rate or rates and at such price or prices as the Authority may approve in the resolution authorizing the issuance of Bonds. Bonds issued after December 31, 1980 shall bear interest at a rate or rates not to exceed the maximum annual rate provided for in Section 2 of "An Act to authorize public corporations to issue bonds, other evidences of indebtedness and tax anticipation warrants subject to interest rate limitations set forth therein", approved May 26, 1970, as amended, and if issued at such maximum annual rate shall be sold for not less than par and accrued interest. If any of the Bonds are issued to bear interest at a rate of less than such maximum annual rate the minimum price at which they may be sold shall be such that the interest cost to the Authority on the proceeds of the Bonds shall not exceed such maximum annual rate computed to stated maturity according to standard tables of bond values.
    (c) In connection with the issuance of its Bonds, the Authority may enter into arrangements to provide additional security and liquidity for the Bonds. These may include, without limitation, municipal bond insurance, letters of credit, lines of credit by which the Authority may borrow funds to pay or redeem its Bonds and purchase or remarketing arrangements for assuring the ability of owners of the Authority's Bonds to sell or to have redeemed their Bonds. The Authority may enter into contracts and may agree to pay fees to persons providing such arrangements, including from Bond proceeds but only under circumstances in which the total interest paid or to be paid on the Bonds, together with the fees for the arrangements (being treated as if interest), would not, taken together, cause the Bonds to bear interest, calculated to their absolute maturity, at a rate in excess of the maximum rate allowed by law.
    The resolution of the Authority authorizing the issuance of its Bonds may provide that interest rates may vary from time to time depending upon criteria established by the Authority, which may include, without limitation, a variation in interest rates as may be necessary to cause Bonds to be remarketable from time to time at a price equal to their principal amount, and may provide for appointment of a national banking association, bank, trust company, investment banker or other financial institution to serve as a remarketing agent in that connection. The resolution of the Authority authorizing the issuance of its Bonds may provide that alternative interest rates or provisions will apply during such times as the Bonds are held by a person providing a letter of credit or other credit enhancement arrangement for those Bonds.

    Sec. 34A-503. Tax levy.
    (a) Before or at the time of issuing any Bonds, the Authority shall provide by resolution for the levy and collection of a direct annual tax upon all the taxable property located within the school district without limit as to rate or amount sufficient to pay and discharge the principal thereof at maturity or on sinking fund installment dates and to pay the interest thereon as it falls due. The taxes as levied shall also include such additional amounts to the extent that the collections in the prior years were insufficient to pay and discharge such principal thereof at maturity, such sinking fund installments, if any, and interest thereon as it fell due and the amount so collected shall be placed in the debt service reserve fund. Such tax shall be in addition to and exclusive of the maximum of all taxes which the Authority, the Board or the City Council of the City is now, or may hereafter be, authorized by law to levy for any and all school purposes. Any such resolution shall be in force upon its adoption.
    (b) Such levy shall be for the sole benefit of the holders of the Bonds and the holders of the Bonds shall have a security interest in, and lien upon, all rights, claims and interests of the Authority arising pursuant to such levy and all present and future proceeds of such levy until principal of and sinking fund installments and interest on the Bonds are paid in full. All proceeds from such levy shall be deposited by each county collector directly in the debt service funds established pursuant to Section 34A-504 hereof and shall be applied solely for the payment of principal of and sinking fund installments and interest on the Bonds and shall not be used for any other purpose.
    A levy with respect to Bonds issued prior to July 1, 1993 (or to refund or continue the refunding of Bonds issued prior to July 1, 1993) shall be for the sole benefit of holders of Bonds issued prior to July 1, 1993 (or to refund or continue the refunding of Bonds issued prior to July 1, 1993). A levy with respect to Bonds issued on or after July 1, 1993 (other than to refund or to continue the refunding of Bonds issued prior to July 1, 1993) shall be for the sole benefit of owners of Bonds issued on or after July 1, 1993 (other than to refund or to continue the refunding of Bonds issued prior to July 1, 1993). Proceeds of taxes levied under this Section shall be deposited in the debt service fund relating to the Bonds with respect to which the taxes were levied.
    (c) Upon the filing in the office of the county clerk of each county wherein the Board is located of a duly certified copy of any such ordinance, it shall be the duty of each such county clerk to extend the tax therein provided for, including an amount determined by the Authority to cover loss and cost of collection and also deferred collections thereof and abatements in the amount of such taxes as extended on the collectors' books. The tax shall be separate and apart from all other taxes of the Authority, the Board and the City and shall be separately identified by the collectors.

    Sec. 34A-602. Limitations of actions after abolition; indemnification. (a) Abolition of the Authority pursuant to Section 34A-605 shall bar any remedy available against the Authority, its Directors, employees, or agents, for any right or claim existing, or any liability incurred, prior to such abolition unless the action or other proceeding thereon is commenced prior to the expiration of 2 years after the date of such abolition.
    (b) The Authority may indemnify any Director, officer, employee, or agent who was or is a party, or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative by reason of the fact that he was a Director, officer, employee or agent of the Authority, against expenses (including attorneys' fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by him in connection with such action, suit or proceeding, if he acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in, or not opposed to the best interests of the Authority and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe his conduct was unlawful. The termination of any action, suit or proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction, or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent, shall not, of itself, create a presumption that the person did not act in good faith in a manner which he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interest of the Authority, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had reasonable cause to believe that his conduct was unlawful.
    To the extent that a Director, officer, employee or agent of the Authority has been successful, on the merits or otherwise, in the defense of any such action, suit or proceeding referred to in this subsection or in defense of any claim, issue or matter therein, he shall be indemnified against expenses (including attorney's fees) actually and reasonably incurred by him in connection therewith. Any such indemnification shall be made by the Authority only as authorized in the specific case, upon a determination that indemnification of the Director, officer, employee or agent is proper in the circumstances because he has met the applicable standard of conduct. Such determination shall be made: (1) by the Board of Directors by a majority vote of a quorum consisting of Directors who are not parties to such action, suit or proceeding, or (2) if such a quorum is not obtainable, or, even if obtainable, a quorum of disinterested Directors so directs, by independent legal counsel in a written opinion.
    Reasonable expenses incurred in defending an action, suit or proceeding shall be paid by the Authority in advance of the final disposition of such action, suit or proceeding, as authorized by the Board of Directors in the specific case, upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of the Director, officer, employee or agent to repay such amount, unless it shall ultimately be determined that he is entitled to be indemnified by the Authority as authorized in this Section.
    Any Director, officer, employee or agent against whom any action, suit or proceeding is brought may employ his or her own attorney to appear on his or her behalf.
    The right to indemnification accorded by this Section shall not limit any other right to indemnification to which the Director, officer, employee or agent may be entitled. Any rights hereunder shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors and administrators of any Director, officer, employee or agent of the Authority.
    The Authority may purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any person who is or was a Director, officer, employee or agent of the Authority against any liability asserted against him and incurred by him in any such capacity, or arising out of his status as such, whether or not the Authority would have the power to indemnify him against such liability under the provisions of this Section.
